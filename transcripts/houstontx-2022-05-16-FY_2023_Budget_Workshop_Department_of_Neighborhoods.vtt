WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:04.282
Appreciate your insight. We will transition to Department of Neighborhoods

00:04.426 --> 00:08.314
and their workshop. At this time, I'd like to welcome director Takarsha

00:08.362 --> 00:11.550
Francis and Herbert Sims to the podium.

00:12.050 --> 00:20.410
Thank you, everyone, for showing up officially.

00:20.490 --> 00:23.070
Good afternoon, Director Francis.

00:24.610 --> 01:49.244
You welcome.

01:49.442 --> 01:53.112
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair. Mayor Pretem,

01:53.256 --> 01:56.472
as well as the other council members and representatives,

01:56.536 --> 02:00.556
our mayor in his absence, as well as those who are viewing by HTV

02:00.588 --> 02:03.996
and our public speakers today. I am Takasha Francis, the proud

02:04.028 --> 02:07.276
director of the Department of Neighborhoods for the City of Houston,

02:07.388 --> 02:11.004
and I'm here to discuss our proposed Department of Neighborhoods

02:11.052 --> 02:14.484
FY 23 operating budget. Now, before I do that,

02:14.522 --> 02:17.396
I want to first of all acknowledge the men and women of the Department of

02:17.418 --> 02:20.752
Neighborhoods who could not be here today, but provide excellent,

02:20.816 --> 02:24.440
stellar service to Houstonians every single day. My personal

02:24.510 --> 02:28.596
message to them, as I tell them often, is how much I appreciate their professionalism,

02:28.708 --> 02:31.944
their flexibility, and their ability to do so

02:31.982 --> 02:35.432
much with so little. But I mostly appreciate that they are true

02:35.486 --> 02:38.892
public servants. So thank you guys for everything that you do.

02:39.026 --> 02:42.284
Of course, no team is complete without leadership, and I want to start

02:42.322 --> 02:45.448
off by acknowledging some of our leadership today. To my immediate

02:45.464 --> 02:49.224
right is one of my assistant directors, Mr. Herbert Sims, who is also our Finance

02:49.272 --> 02:52.576
Manager. I'd like to ask the following leaders to also stand as I

02:52.598 --> 02:55.756
call their names. Our Assistant Director, Mr. Reggie Harris,

02:55.788 --> 02:59.244
who is present with us, who oversees our Inspections and Public

02:59.302 --> 03:02.896
Services division. Our finance Manager

03:02.928 --> 03:05.616
has already been acknowledged. Our pio,

03:05.808 --> 03:09.316
Evangelina Behill, is behind you all, taking wonderful pictures that

03:09.338 --> 03:12.120
you'll see later on in our social media channels. Mr.

03:12.190 --> 03:16.360
Mark Cueva is our senior staff analyst, who is also present

03:16.430 --> 03:20.612
with us. Ms. Mulaney, Morris and Joel Aguere are our administrative

03:20.676 --> 03:24.056
coordinators in the director's office. And now on

03:24.078 --> 03:27.888
to our division managers who are also present. Ms. Rhonda. Saudder,

03:27.924 --> 03:31.340
Division Manager of the Mayor's Assistance Office mr.

03:31.410 --> 03:34.716
Victor Gonzalez, who is the Division manager of the Mayor's Office of

03:34.738 --> 03:38.260
Gang Prevention and Intervention. Mr. Terrence O'Neill,

03:38.360 --> 03:42.124
division Manager of the Office of New Americans and Immigrant Communities.

03:42.252 --> 03:45.900
And last but not least, Mr. Paul Green, the Office of Neighborhood

03:45.980 --> 03:49.536
Engagement. These leaders are to be commended, and I thank them for

03:49.558 --> 03:52.804
being partners with me every single day as we deliver these

03:52.842 --> 03:56.624
services to the City of Houston. Found on the next slide. Next slide,

03:56.672 --> 04:00.304
please. We begin today's presentation

04:00.352 --> 04:04.036
with a snapshot of our functional organizational chart. As you'll notice,

04:04.068 --> 04:08.164
this chart includes both personnel and operational expenditures

04:08.292 --> 04:12.436
to comply with the performance based budget criteria and format. Our divisions

04:12.468 --> 04:16.172
and expenditures are placed into several programs. You'll also

04:16.226 --> 04:19.388
notice a subtle change in our program titles. First with the

04:19.394 --> 04:22.764
Mayor's Office of Gang Prevention and Intervention which houses our

04:22.802 --> 04:26.420
antigang programming and grant funded auxiliary programs

04:26.520 --> 04:30.640
such as Gang Victims Federal Grant Program Early Intervention Services

04:30.790 --> 04:34.784
and Harris County Probation Gang Intervention and Prevention Program.

04:34.982 --> 04:38.732
You'll also see that we've added the Office of Neighborhood Engagement.

04:38.876 --> 04:42.836
This office was created by transferring five FTEs out

04:42.858 --> 04:46.564
of the Director's Office, so it is a net neutral move. There is no

04:46.602 --> 04:50.436
additional cost, and it is focused primarily on the Department's community

04:50.538 --> 04:54.248
programming and civic participation. The programs housed in

04:54.254 --> 04:58.804
this division include, but are not limited to complete communities University

04:58.932 --> 05:02.664
the Mayor's Youth Council Volunteer Initiatives, a month

05:02.702 --> 05:06.088
of Service program, the upcoming Signbusters program,

05:06.174 --> 05:10.924
council Member Alcohorn and Neighborhood Matching Grants Next

05:10.962 --> 05:14.616
slide, please. Now, the departmental

05:14.648 --> 05:17.968
programming for the Department of Neighborhoods houses four major

05:18.054 --> 05:21.084
service areas residential Code Enforcement,

05:21.212 --> 05:24.220
Community Engagement and Neighborhood Initiatives,

05:24.380 --> 05:28.076
citizenship Assistance and Language Access and Gang

05:28.108 --> 05:31.264
Prevention and intervention services. Now, each slide

05:31.312 --> 05:34.480
will outline our major services, the statutory

05:34.560 --> 05:37.988
requirements, additional financial grant funded support,

05:38.154 --> 05:42.020
and then the financial and or societal impact for each service.

05:42.170 --> 05:45.604
Now, for Brevity, I will touch on the service and the financial

05:45.652 --> 05:48.884
and societal impact, and I will reference funding

05:48.932 --> 05:52.820
when applicable. But I will stand open for any questions if you have them thereafter.

05:52.980 --> 05:56.524
Starting with the Residential Code Enforcement Division. This is our largest and

05:56.562 --> 05:59.960
most outward facing division. Please note the statutory

06:00.040 --> 06:04.076
requirements and grant funding listed this year. We have 26

06:04.178 --> 06:08.156
Code Enforcement officers and inspector positions

06:08.188 --> 06:11.868
budgeted on the General Fund. 43 Code Enforcement Officer

06:11.884 --> 06:15.548
and inspector positions are budgeted under CDBG grant funds.

06:15.644 --> 06:19.116
However, in fiscal year 22, we were greatly affected

06:19.148 --> 06:23.012
by an increase in turnover and so. Currently, we have a 19%

06:23.066 --> 06:26.464
vacancy rate on the General Fund and a 28% vacancy

06:26.512 --> 06:30.692
rate including grant funds. So what we have is a total of

06:30.826 --> 06:34.408
69 budgeted Code Enforcement Officer positions that

06:34.494 --> 06:38.292
equates to 50 boots on the ground and 19

06:38.356 --> 06:41.944
vacancies. When we look at the financial next

06:41.982 --> 06:45.688
slide, please. When we look at the financial

06:45.784 --> 06:49.532
and societal impact of this particular service area,

06:49.666 --> 06:53.144
residential Code Enforcement carries both financial and societal

06:53.192 --> 06:56.516
impacts. Blight such as dilapidated structures,

06:56.648 --> 07:00.156
high weeds, and junk motor vehicles continue to pose a major threat

07:00.188 --> 07:03.628
to public health and safety. Societal impacts include

07:03.724 --> 07:07.308
safer healthier communities with less crime,

07:07.404 --> 07:10.784
urban decay, and increases economic vitality

07:10.832 --> 07:14.192
and opportunity. The financial impacts of Code enforcement

07:14.256 --> 07:18.224
mirror those social impacts and also include a lowered maintenance

07:18.272 --> 07:22.052
cost for these Blighted properties, increased property values,

07:22.116 --> 07:25.624
and tax collections. However, the rising cost to

07:25.662 --> 07:30.196
abate Blighted properties due to more expensive labor and supplies,

07:30.388 --> 07:33.556
including fuel, primarily may increase the

07:33.598 --> 07:36.830
city's expenses. Next slide, please.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.964
Our next service area is Gang Prevention and Intervention, which is

07:42.002 --> 07:45.144
housed within the Mayor's Office of Gang Prevention and Intervention.

07:45.272 --> 07:49.244
Most notably, this division oversees programs that promote awareness,

07:49.372 --> 07:53.292
build resistance skills, and educate on the dangers of gang involvement

07:53.356 --> 07:57.484
and juvenile delinquency. Please note the statutory requirements

07:57.612 --> 08:00.560
and the additional support and impact.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.990
Next slide, please.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.920
The next service area is our Community Engagement and Neighborhood

08:08.000 --> 08:11.716
Initiatives. This area refers to two of our areas

08:11.748 --> 08:14.984
the Mayor's Assistance Office and the Office of

08:15.022 --> 08:18.772
Neighborhood Engagement. Please take note of the statutory requirements

08:18.836 --> 08:22.248
and additional financial support. Now of course,

08:22.334 --> 08:25.848
as we've noted previously, we changed the Mayor's Assistance Office

08:26.014 --> 08:29.720
from the Mayor's Citizens Assistance Office to be more inclusive

08:29.800 --> 08:33.276
of all residents in the City of Houston. I'm very proud of our

08:33.298 --> 08:37.196
one of a kind collaboration of workshops and community program through

08:37.218 --> 08:41.072
the Office of Neighborhood Engagement. And I also would like to take this moment

08:41.126 --> 08:44.608
to acknowledge our Citizenship Assistance and Language access

08:44.694 --> 08:48.332
services through the Office of New Americans and Immigrant Communities.

08:48.476 --> 08:52.260
And it is a thriving program that is utilized throughout the City

08:52.330 --> 08:55.648
and a major component of citizenship assistance.

08:55.824 --> 08:59.076
Now, when we look at the financial and societal impact of all three

08:59.098 --> 09:02.596
of these service delivery areas social programming such as youth

09:02.628 --> 09:06.072
prevention and intervention services, super neighborhoods and

09:06.126 --> 09:09.316
citizenship Assistance increase civic engagement,

09:09.428 --> 09:13.224
public awareness and education, and it empowers communities to

09:13.262 --> 09:17.036
advocate and improve their quality of life. We saw that in

09:17.058 --> 09:21.368
the last presentation. These programs provide similar financial impacts

09:21.384 --> 09:24.904
as Code enforcement indirectly over time through implementation

09:24.952 --> 09:29.196
of the various programming and services. I believe my colleague, Chief Samuel

09:29.228 --> 09:32.512
Pena said in his presentation, prevention is key. So these

09:32.566 --> 09:36.144
programs are a way for us to prevent some of the issues by

09:36.182 --> 09:39.636
providing appropriate education to the communities that need them on

09:39.658 --> 09:43.136
how to be good neighbors and how to follow City protocol

09:43.168 --> 09:45.350
and programs. Next slide, please.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.356
Now, as we look at the anticipated growth or reduction in

09:50.378 --> 09:54.596
population serves and how that actually affects our budget, we're always cognizant

09:54.628 --> 09:57.972
of how that will also affect our ability to deliver

09:58.036 --> 10:01.620
services. Now, as the City grows, we have to consider these challenges

10:01.700 --> 10:05.452
to maintain a service level that's not sustainable with our current

10:05.506 --> 10:08.600
budget. As I mentioned before, rising costs,

10:08.680 --> 10:12.184
particularly in labor and supplies fuel

10:12.312 --> 10:15.772
this will affect the number of abatements that can be completed within

10:15.826 --> 10:19.612
the limited budget we've been given. So, for example, as we procure

10:19.676 --> 10:23.456
new Lands and Grounds maintenance and debris removal contracts in the

10:23.478 --> 10:28.080
upcoming fiscal year, we face fuel costs that have increased 55%

10:28.230 --> 10:31.776
since the last contract procurement in 2018.

10:31.968 --> 10:36.052
Currently, Code Enforcement officers are expected to inspect over one

10:36.106 --> 10:39.684
over 13 sq. Mi out of a total

10:39.722 --> 10:42.744
of 627 sq. Mi of the entire city.

10:42.862 --> 10:46.600
And our Community Liaisons average 400,000

10:46.670 --> 10:50.100
residents based on the super neighborhoods they are required

10:50.180 --> 10:53.584
to give services to. So as the City continues

10:53.652 --> 10:57.740
to increase in population, our budgets will get tighter, these numbers

10:57.810 --> 11:01.624
will grow and our services will be stretched. Next slide

11:01.672 --> 11:02.270
please.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.224
Don's revenue is primarily the money that we

11:08.262 --> 11:11.904
collect from liens from Property Abatement Section. Ten,

11:12.022 --> 11:15.344
four, five, three of the City's Municipal Code allows us to

11:15.382 --> 11:18.792
place liens on properties to recoup the City's expenses

11:18.876 --> 11:21.776
as a result of demolitions of dangerous buildings,

11:21.888 --> 11:25.392
weed and debris removal on vacant lots, and securing

11:25.456 --> 11:28.912
properties. We recoup these funds either from voluntary

11:28.976 --> 11:32.436
payment or the legal process of foreclosing on

11:32.458 --> 11:36.004
these liens. Now, you'll notice in this slide a large decrease

11:36.052 --> 11:40.120
in revenue under licenses and permits. The reason for that is that Don

11:40.190 --> 11:43.824
no longer collects the deposit fees that we previously transferred

11:43.892 --> 11:47.976
from Houston Public Works. Next slide,

11:48.008 --> 11:51.864
please. Our revenue highlights

11:51.912 --> 11:55.224
include a projected increase in fiscal year 23 revenue

11:55.272 --> 11:58.684
collection by approximately 8% over FY

11:58.732 --> 12:02.604
22 estimates. The change is a projection based on pandemic

12:02.652 --> 12:06.144
restrictions being eased. Our current revenue collection is

12:06.182 --> 12:10.052
based on trend analysis as well as external variables due to

12:10.106 --> 12:12.180
passive collection methods.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.390
Next slide, please.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.384
Last year, we projected our FY 22 expenditures

12:20.432 --> 12:23.976
to be around $12.4 million, based on

12:23.998 --> 12:27.684
the most recent data we project to hit that mark. Our proposed

12:27.732 --> 12:31.368
budget for FY 23 includes few minor changes,

12:31.534 --> 12:35.548
but overall the proposed budget, which includes a 1% or

12:35.634 --> 12:39.544
126,000 personnel budget increase from FY

12:39.592 --> 12:43.628
22 estimates due to Hope allowances and health care

12:43.714 --> 12:47.424
and pension obligations. So that is the only difference in

12:47.462 --> 12:50.530
what we are presenting today. Next slide, please.

12:51.460 --> 12:55.404
Now, the next slide here provides a snapshot of our personnel versus

12:55.452 --> 12:58.716
nonpersonal expenditures. In the first circle graph,

12:58.748 --> 13:01.892
you'll notice we have personnel expenditures at 68%

13:01.946 --> 13:05.028
of Don's overall budget. The remaining 32

13:05.114 --> 13:08.224
in the second pie graph shows our non personnel

13:08.272 --> 13:11.560
services, which include miscellaneous support services,

13:11.710 --> 13:14.468
supplies and services like computers,

13:14.564 --> 13:17.444
printing, publications, uniforms,

13:17.572 --> 13:21.556
document filing services and then, of course, restricted accounts

13:21.588 --> 13:24.728
as determined by Central Finance, which include fuel,

13:24.824 --> 13:28.590
health insurance, HR, client services and vehicle services.

13:29.440 --> 13:33.052
Next slide, please. Now, slide number

13:33.106 --> 13:36.940
twelve provides a detailed explanation of our expenditure net changes.

13:37.090 --> 13:40.576
One major change was $157,000 for

13:40.598 --> 13:44.080
Hope allowances as well as health benefits and a restricted account

13:44.150 --> 13:47.964
return. Overall, there is little to no change from the FY

13:48.012 --> 13:52.532
22 operating budget. Based on the proposed 2023

13:52.586 --> 13:56.084
budget of 12.6 million. The recent change has

13:56.122 --> 13:59.860
been 1.9% from last year's budget or

13:59.930 --> 14:02.890
the current budget. Next slide, please.

14:05.580 --> 14:09.560
Now, under our expenditure highlights, you'll notice that there is a 15%

14:09.630 --> 14:13.720
increase of restricted accounts. There is 2.3%

14:13.790 --> 14:17.448
reduction in our supplies and service line items.

14:17.544 --> 14:21.336
And then of course, as I mentioned previously, 68% of Don's overall

14:21.368 --> 14:24.760
budget is allocated to personnel expenses.

14:24.920 --> 14:28.476
This concludes my presentation. And before we move to Q and

14:28.498 --> 14:31.724
A, we just like you to take a moment at your leisure to include additional

14:31.772 --> 14:35.772
information in the appendices for your viewing and accomplishment

14:35.836 --> 14:39.916
pleasure. I now stand open for your questions. Thank you, Director Francis.

14:40.028 --> 14:43.840
First up, we will have Council Member Michael Kubosh. Thank you, council member.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.136
Director Francis. That was excellent. Thank you. And your voice

14:47.168 --> 14:50.390
is easy to hear. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir.

14:51.480 --> 14:55.160
Bandit Signs? Yes. Where are we

14:55.310 --> 14:58.936
on trying to get these things removed? Are we writing tickets for

14:58.958 --> 15:02.616
them? Are we just pulling them up? Well, I'm very glad that

15:02.638 --> 15:06.468
you asked that question. So, what we've done since last year council

15:06.484 --> 15:09.516
Member Alcorn reached out personally and wanted to

15:09.538 --> 15:13.244
know about a volunteer Bandit Sign program and so for the last year,

15:13.282 --> 15:17.144
we've been working with Harris County so that we could combine our efforts

15:17.192 --> 15:20.240
and kind of come out of that silo mentality to develop

15:20.310 --> 15:24.236
a volunteer program. Now, one of the things that has actually held

15:24.268 --> 15:27.856
us up is the fact that their bandit sign program, of course, deals with

15:27.878 --> 15:31.988
the ETJ when they have a different statutory requirement for actually

15:32.074 --> 15:35.524
picking up the bandit signs and assessing fines. So what we're doing

15:35.562 --> 15:39.444
right now is trying to put together a program that will allow

15:39.482 --> 15:43.304
a combined training so that volunteers can be trained to

15:43.342 --> 15:46.616
either volunteer in the county or within the city. So let me ask

15:46.638 --> 15:49.252
you, can any citizen safely,

15:49.396 --> 15:52.920
without getting hit by traffic, remove a sign,

15:52.990 --> 15:56.188
a bandit sign, from a median area

15:56.274 --> 15:59.276
in between the roads? You can.

15:59.378 --> 16:03.084
But, Council Member Kubash, I'm smiling because

16:03.202 --> 16:06.556
I have to admit, sometimes I do it well,

16:06.738 --> 16:10.040
but I don't want you to do it. I know, and I'm not going to

16:10.050 --> 16:12.992
do it. Sometimes I want to stop and get stuff out of the road,

16:13.046 --> 16:15.808
but I realize that I might become a part of the road.

16:15.974 --> 16:19.552
So another thing is we're in political season,

16:19.616 --> 16:22.996
the crazy season. Yes. They're sticking these things all over the place.

16:23.098 --> 16:27.232
Absolutely. They're attaching them to road signs, these big four baits,

16:27.296 --> 16:30.390
and we need some.

16:30.840 --> 16:34.180
I see a lot of them in the ETJ as well,

16:34.250 --> 16:38.084
so we need to do something about that. Are we writing these folks citations?

16:38.212 --> 16:41.704
Yes, sir, we are writing citations. You want a picture of them sent to you

16:41.742 --> 16:45.028
or sent in three? One. One. You do whatever you feel is necessary except

16:45.044 --> 16:48.316
pick up that sign. You call me, you tell me, and I'll go over

16:48.338 --> 16:51.644
there and pick it up. But in all seriousness, Council Member Kubosh, we are very

16:51.682 --> 16:55.900
cognizant of the fact that political season is one. Permission to extend?

16:56.560 --> 17:01.296
No, you don't need it. Go ahead. Okay. But I need it so

17:01.398 --> 17:05.840
very quickly because I do realize other people that just means Kubash's time has expired.

17:06.340 --> 17:07.730
Put me back in.

17:09.540 --> 17:13.044
We're working on trying to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of making

17:13.082 --> 17:15.876
sure that we're getting the signs up, hence the volunteer program.

17:15.978 --> 17:20.656
But we're also looking at ways to better educate our candidates

17:20.848 --> 17:24.356
with the importance of being able to go behind. Once you've put

17:24.378 --> 17:27.816
the signs up, please go back and pick them up. So we're working on that,

17:27.838 --> 17:30.650
and we're aware of the issue, but thank you for bringing it to light today.

17:31.340 --> 17:34.636
Vice Mayor Pro TEM Martha Castex Tatum. Thank you,

17:34.658 --> 17:38.860
chair. Director Francis. Thank you for the presentation. Last year,

17:39.010 --> 17:42.332
one of our budget amendments was for each

17:42.386 --> 17:46.764
district to have a code enforcement officer

17:46.812 --> 17:50.000
to work with our individual offices,

17:50.340 --> 17:53.232
and that passed. However, that hasn't happened.

17:53.286 --> 17:57.152
I see that we have quite a few vacancies in the code

17:57.206 --> 18:00.628
enforcement arena. However, I'm very

18:00.714 --> 18:04.560
interested, and I think it would be advantageous

18:04.640 --> 18:08.276
for us as we work to protect neighborhoods alongside the Department of

18:08.298 --> 18:11.936
Neighborhoods, to have a direct contact and

18:11.978 --> 18:15.416
individual code enforcement officer that works with

18:15.438 --> 18:19.332
our office. I liked when we had that individual liaison

18:19.396 --> 18:23.236
that worked with our offices. I know that staffing

18:23.428 --> 18:26.652
is a challenge, but I would like to see us

18:26.706 --> 18:30.684
move towards having someone specific that

18:30.722 --> 18:34.408
we can work with in our offices

18:34.504 --> 18:38.480
to help with the enforcement in our districts.

18:39.220 --> 18:42.656
With all due respect to the mayor's office

18:42.838 --> 18:46.464
and Renee and Rhonda, they do a phenomenal job, but God help

18:46.502 --> 18:50.612
them, there's no way that they can manage the number

18:50.666 --> 18:54.470
of code enforcement issues that we deal in this entire city.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.900
But I know that residents like having that specific person.

18:59.050 --> 19:02.504
I like having a specific person. Is there a way

19:02.542 --> 19:07.080
we can move towards having an individual person

19:07.150 --> 19:10.644
from your office that works with our individual offices

19:10.692 --> 19:14.276
for code enforcement issues? Sure. And actually Vice Mayor

19:14.308 --> 19:17.240
Pro Tim. You currently have one. So I know that you remember,

19:17.310 --> 19:20.604
because you were here when I came in as Director, that we did have a

19:20.642 --> 19:23.996
specific liaison for all of the council members because at

19:24.018 --> 19:27.976
that time, we were about 20,000 cases behind. And so the Mayor's

19:28.008 --> 19:31.804
Assistance Office, that is part of their responsibility to communicate

19:31.932 --> 19:35.920
any issues that you all are having and to basically help you solve the issues

19:35.990 --> 19:39.708
that you're having or that citizens are having in your particular district.

19:39.804 --> 19:44.608
We also have a call number I'm

19:44.624 --> 19:47.648
sorry, a customer service number directly to IPS.

19:47.744 --> 19:51.188
So if there is an issue where citizens, they can call three one one

19:51.274 --> 19:55.216
and then they can follow up. So what I think part of the disconnect might

19:55.258 --> 19:58.856
be, and I'm happy to take this call offline is if

19:58.878 --> 20:02.376
there's another level of service that you're looking for from the liaisons who are

20:02.398 --> 20:06.516
assigned to the super neighborhoods in your district. I'm happy to have that conversation

20:06.628 --> 20:10.328
so that we can be more efficient in how we are actually communicating.

20:10.424 --> 20:13.836
And I will go back and take another look at that budget amendment regarding a

20:13.858 --> 20:17.660
specific code enforcement officer to each district, because currently

20:17.810 --> 20:21.232
our code enforcement officers, as I mentioned before, there are 50

20:21.286 --> 20:24.864
on the ground. We do have vacancies that are available, but I think every

20:24.902 --> 20:28.496
director will share with you all that the city has not been immune to the

20:28.518 --> 20:32.100
great resignation, nor have we been immune to people

20:32.250 --> 20:35.504
having other options that they choose to pursue. In code enforcement,

20:35.552 --> 20:38.804
unfortunately, is not at the top of that list. Nor is

20:38.842 --> 20:42.436
our salary competitive enough. So that's another issue that

20:42.458 --> 20:46.580
we'd like to kind of deal with. But I'm happy to take that conversation offline,

20:46.660 --> 20:50.248
have a more specific conversation about what your office is looking for,

20:50.334 --> 20:53.592
and then we can make sure our liaisons are making

20:53.646 --> 20:57.176
those adjustments. Okay. And then the other question I'll put you back

20:57.198 --> 21:00.284
in queue, if you don't mind. You have you 1 minute of fame. I gave

21:00.322 --> 21:02.952
you three. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

21:03.016 --> 21:06.996
Yes. Thank you, Chair. And thank you, Director. I want to get a good handle

21:07.048 --> 21:10.736
on the number of inspectors that you have. You said 56 out

21:10.758 --> 21:14.672
of the general fund. It looks like you're including 53

21:14.806 --> 21:18.956
in code enforcement in this budget. Then you

21:18.998 --> 21:21.140
said 43 are from CDBG.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.550
Okay. So we're not getting more.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.876
You have 19 vacancies. Are those all within the general fund or were

21:29.898 --> 21:33.256
those CDBG or combined? How many

21:33.278 --> 21:36.408
do you want to have total? From the general fund?

21:36.494 --> 21:41.224
Yeah, you need to have 300, but you've got about nine.

21:41.422 --> 21:45.204
Sure. So according to my notes

21:45.252 --> 21:48.760
here, we have 69 budgeted positions.

21:48.840 --> 21:52.492
From the general fund or from both? That and CDBG? For both. Okay. For both?

21:52.546 --> 21:56.316
For both. All right. And out

21:56.338 --> 22:00.764
of those 69 positions, 26 are general fund, 43 are CDBG

22:00.812 --> 22:04.576
funded. Okay. In looking at your performance measures, I'm just

22:04.598 --> 22:07.936
curious if you're going to keep the same amount or you're hopefully going to fill

22:07.958 --> 22:11.204
the vacancies. I mean, I'm sure you're actively pursuing people to fill

22:11.242 --> 22:15.556
these vacancies. Sure. Because you're talking about going from 250

22:15.738 --> 22:19.284
daily inspections to 350 daily inspections. Yes.

22:19.322 --> 22:24.016
You're talking about junk motor vehicles removed

22:24.208 --> 22:27.464
last year. You had a target of 3500. You guys got to

22:27.502 --> 22:30.920
860. You're doubling that for next year.

22:31.070 --> 22:34.700
I'm looking at weeded lots. You want to go from 10,000

22:34.770 --> 22:38.156
this year to 15,000. And my question is

22:38.178 --> 22:42.428
just simply how are you going to do that without

22:42.514 --> 22:45.500
adding significantly to the number of inspectors?

22:45.840 --> 22:49.184
And I appreciate that question. The first thing I'd like to point out,

22:49.222 --> 22:53.148
and I'm thankful that you have actually made that picture a lot more clearer,

22:53.244 --> 22:56.784
is that our code enforcement staff has

22:56.822 --> 23:00.096
been able to do a phenomenal job considering the fact that we

23:00.118 --> 23:03.764
don't have enough code enforcement officers. And in order for them to do that,

23:03.802 --> 23:07.680
that means a lot of double work, double areas,

23:07.840 --> 23:11.204
which is part of the reason why we can't necessarily dedicate in

23:11.242 --> 23:14.620
one particular place. What I can say to you, Council Member Alcorn,

23:14.640 --> 23:18.008
is that we will continue to work assiduously to bring in

23:18.174 --> 23:21.956
code enforcement officers. But let me be very blunt about what we've experienced

23:21.988 --> 23:25.336
in the last year. We've had a lot of people sign on and

23:25.358 --> 23:29.224
then they leave within a month. So whether it's been

23:29.262 --> 23:31.356
I don't know if it's that they just had a different idea of what the

23:31.378 --> 23:33.916
job was, maybe they got out in the heat and decided they didn't want to

23:33.938 --> 23:37.468
do it. But we have not had people. The turnover has been

23:37.554 --> 23:40.784
considerable. So what I can tell you that

23:40.822 --> 23:44.144
we are attempting to do to reach this goal has

23:44.182 --> 23:48.028
really been not only with our inspections, but with our Abatement budget.

23:48.124 --> 23:52.116
We have become much more aggressive about correcting the issues through

23:52.138 --> 23:55.680
our Abatement budget in addition to giving notification

23:55.840 --> 23:59.508
to recalcitrate property owners, because ultimately, at the end of the day,

23:59.594 --> 24:02.964
communities want it corrected. They don't really care

24:03.002 --> 24:06.496
about the inspection. They just want to wake up and not see this lot next

24:06.538 --> 24:10.276
door. So part of what we are looking to do in terms of accomplishing

24:10.308 --> 24:13.448
that feat, which is what we have done in terms, of course, correction over the

24:13.454 --> 24:16.996
last few years is focused more on the correction side, which is

24:17.038 --> 24:20.620
why our ability to recoup on the lien foreclosure side

24:20.690 --> 24:24.156
instead of relying on passive people that just come in and decide to pay the

24:24.178 --> 24:27.884
money. We have to become more aggressive as a city in going after

24:27.922 --> 24:31.328
the money that we're putting out. So that's how we plan to do that.

24:31.414 --> 24:35.216
Council Member Amy Pick. Thank you, Chair. And thank

24:35.238 --> 24:38.384
you, Director. Kind of similar to Council Member Alcorn's question about

24:38.422 --> 24:42.124
inspections. You talked about the anticipated growth and the constraints

24:42.172 --> 24:46.292
there. Do you have goals as far as what the turnaround time will be for

24:46.346 --> 24:50.084
inspections for this next fiscal year and not just the first inspection, but also

24:50.122 --> 24:53.316
the look back inspections as well? Well, as you

24:53.338 --> 24:56.568
know, council Member part of the ability to go back and do

24:56.654 --> 25:00.676
the check back inspections that we do after the initial really depends

25:00.708 --> 25:04.344
on the bodies we have on the ground. So what we're trying to do now

25:04.382 --> 25:08.440
as we're looking at our positions is trying to figure out how we can possibly

25:08.520 --> 25:12.472
go back and reconfigure

25:12.536 --> 25:15.756
our ability to go back and do those. But I'll be very honest with you.

25:15.778 --> 25:19.676
Based on the limited amount of people we have, I don't see those times changing.

25:19.788 --> 25:23.680
What I can say to you, however, is that we have now started

25:23.750 --> 25:27.340
utilizing under the code an emergency provision. Because, sadly,

25:27.420 --> 25:31.184
so many of the vacant lots that we have or some of the dilapidated

25:31.232 --> 25:34.452
buildings that we have in our communities are in such

25:34.506 --> 25:38.240
disrepair and are so high that they actually qualify

25:38.320 --> 25:41.476
through our emergency abatements, which are given to us under the

25:41.498 --> 25:44.856
code. And so one of the focuses that we've done at

25:44.878 --> 25:48.488
this particular point now hasn't been as much of a focus so much on

25:48.574 --> 25:52.852
the checkback inspections, but really looking at our inventory,

25:52.996 --> 25:57.048
what breaches the emergency threshold and really trying to address those

25:57.134 --> 26:00.824
a lot faster. So it has a tangential effect on our ability

26:00.872 --> 26:03.276
to get back around. So even if we're not able to get back on a

26:03.298 --> 26:07.352
checkback inspection, if something rolls on our radar that is emergency

26:07.416 --> 26:10.348
level, then we address that with a level of priority.

26:10.524 --> 26:13.904
So I hope that answers the question a little better.

26:14.102 --> 26:16.960
Yes, thank you. And in the interest of time, I'll just put the rest on

26:17.030 --> 26:19.968
SharePoint. Thank you. Council member Tiffany Thomas.

26:20.144 --> 26:23.856
Thank you. Thank you. Director, the number around the bandit

26:23.888 --> 26:27.344
signs, does that include the solid? Excuse me? The hotspot

26:27.392 --> 26:30.896
team, their work in districts, do they contribute

26:30.928 --> 26:34.500
to this 45,000 or is this your team exclusively?

26:34.580 --> 26:38.264
No, this was our team. Wow. So this number could actually be higher in terms

26:38.302 --> 26:41.050
of like, collective effort? Possibly, yes.

26:43.180 --> 26:46.348
Council Member Michael Kubosh. Thank you very much. Good to

26:46.354 --> 26:50.060
see you. Reggie Harris. I guess I've known you about 25

26:50.130 --> 26:52.190
years. It's good to see you.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.712
The electronic ticket writing process that we,

26:56.786 --> 27:00.064
years ago, we passed, I can't remember what it was

27:00.102 --> 27:03.584
called, electronic ticket writing. Or are you speaking

27:03.622 --> 27:06.976
of us moving from paper to N four?

27:07.158 --> 27:11.040
N four. Are we using N four today? Oh, absolutely.

27:11.190 --> 27:14.816
We're not the only ones. It's actually we've influenced the fire department

27:14.848 --> 27:17.684
to come on to N four, as well as, I think, some aspects of public

27:17.722 --> 27:21.136
works. So it's working very well for us. And what about parking and

27:21.178 --> 27:23.080
handicapped parking spots?

27:26.860 --> 27:30.804
Is that under your department writing? I was going to say I'm going to defer

27:30.852 --> 27:34.568
to my colleague, Director Tina Pius, on that. Well, that's her wheelhouse.

27:34.664 --> 27:38.444
The other thing is, what legislation are you looking at that

27:38.482 --> 27:42.232
maybe the legislature could pass that could help our Department

27:42.296 --> 27:46.216
of Neighborhoods to properly function or function better

27:46.338 --> 27:49.584
in Houston? I think the Legislature, the last

27:49.622 --> 27:53.804
time we actually submitted and supported legislation, it was around higher fines

27:53.852 --> 27:58.172
so that there would be more of a financial

27:58.236 --> 28:02.176
impact to most property owners, most recalcitrant

28:02.208 --> 28:05.872
property owners in many of our communities, Council Member Kubash,

28:05.936 --> 28:09.796
are actually businesses that are just land grabbing and holding. It's not the

28:09.818 --> 28:12.928
average everyday Houstonian. So that was something that we

28:12.954 --> 28:16.436
were very supportive of. And I believe that that was legislation through Senator

28:16.468 --> 28:20.532
Miles's office and I believe State Representative theory previously

28:20.676 --> 28:24.424
moved for higher fines. Really, where the department is going

28:24.462 --> 28:28.124
to be, I think most benefited is looking at our

28:28.162 --> 28:31.304
Abatement budget. And Mayor Turner has been very gracious

28:31.352 --> 28:34.748
in giving us additional money when we've asked for it so that we could be

28:34.834 --> 28:38.936
more proactive on the Abatement side. But I think to couple with

28:38.978 --> 28:42.816
that, again, the city has to be more aggressive in recouping its

28:42.838 --> 28:46.204
money legally once we put it out, because otherwise

28:46.332 --> 28:49.664
we're just putting good money after bad and people rely on us to just

28:49.702 --> 28:52.532
do something they should be doing themselves. Thank you for your service. Thank you,

28:52.586 --> 28:56.512
council Member Kubash. Administration. Regulatory affairs. Budget presentation

28:56.576 --> 29:00.096
is Thursday at 230. Council member or vice

29:00.128 --> 29:03.416
mayor. Pro TEM martha Castex Tatum. Thank you.

29:03.438 --> 29:06.884
Chair Director Francis, what's the pay for a code enforcement

29:06.932 --> 29:09.880
officer? Currently? The starting pay, I believe, is what,

29:09.950 --> 29:14.600
35? Yeah, it's about 35

29:14.670 --> 29:18.076
for a trainee, and you

29:18.098 --> 29:21.436
go up from there for one, two, and a three. By the time you get

29:21.458 --> 29:24.684
to a three, you're looking at a little over 2000 bi

29:24.722 --> 29:28.516
weekly pay. And I think it's 35 with salary.

29:28.648 --> 29:31.760
Thousand dollars and including benefits,

29:31.830 --> 29:35.424
is it not? And we just gave an increase, so it's probably closer to 38

29:35.462 --> 29:39.184
now, a hard fault increase. So I know you all looking

29:39.222 --> 29:42.656
at us like that seems quite low, but that's a recent increase

29:42.688 --> 29:46.276
on top of that. Yes. What's the

29:46.298 --> 29:50.244
average payout in other cities? Are we competitive with

29:50.282 --> 29:53.492
other cities? Are we way below we're not. As a matter of fact,

29:53.546 --> 29:56.240
what I can do, I'll take that as a homework assignment and send that to

29:56.250 --> 29:59.944
you on SharePoint. But what I can tell you is that we're not competitive with

29:59.982 --> 30:03.368
other cities and we're not even competitive within the city. We lose some of

30:03.374 --> 30:07.324
our code enforcement officers to Public Works, who also

30:07.442 --> 30:11.324
offer similar requirements for higher pay for

30:11.362 --> 30:14.968
commercial buildings. What's the requirement? To be a code enforcement officer.

30:15.064 --> 30:17.836
To be a code enforcement officer here in the state of Texas, it is a

30:17.858 --> 30:20.720
state certified program that we pay for coming in.

30:20.790 --> 30:24.720
I believe that program is one year. And then after that, they're actually moved into

30:24.790 --> 30:28.224
a code enforcement officer position. Now, Public Works has

30:28.262 --> 30:31.524
different types of code enforcement officers that deal with different

30:31.562 --> 30:34.704
parts of building codes, and that may have a different requirement,

30:34.752 --> 30:37.460
but this specific requirement is state certified.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.736
Okay. And then my other ask that if you could on

30:41.758 --> 30:45.624
page 19, I like the accomplishments list.

30:45.822 --> 30:49.720
Is there any way that that can be broken down per district?

30:52.380 --> 30:55.192
And page 19,

30:55.256 --> 30:58.380
page 20. I love all the statistics.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.804
Specifically, what's helpful for me, if we can have

31:01.842 --> 31:05.644
those numbers district broken down

31:05.682 --> 31:08.672
by district, we can accommodate that. Okay.

31:08.726 --> 31:12.320
Thank you. Vice Chair Edward Pollard.

31:12.900 --> 31:16.784
Thank you, Mayor Pro Tim. And thank you all for your presentation. When we're talking

31:16.822 --> 31:20.484
about the code enforcement officers, are there any

31:20.522 --> 31:23.892
ways in which we can better utilize our Hot

31:23.946 --> 31:28.704
team personnel to help with picture

31:28.752 --> 31:34.584
taking, to help with any type of code enforcement or any

31:34.622 --> 31:37.896
of that process? It seems like when our Hot teams are out there in

31:37.918 --> 31:41.572
the neighborhoods already servicing

31:41.636 --> 31:44.952
our residents, they're able to see things that

31:45.006 --> 31:48.572
may be in violation or be able to take pictures to send

31:48.626 --> 31:52.076
in. Is there a way in which

31:52.098 --> 31:55.756
we could be more efficient and be able to utilize them in

31:55.778 --> 31:59.464
a manner that will help your department more honestly? Council Member

31:59.512 --> 32:03.196
the fact that you all have Hot teams in place is helpful.

32:03.388 --> 32:06.784
We really don't need any additional help in the reporting area because we get over

32:06.822 --> 32:10.716
51,000 calls through three one one. So we're aware

32:10.828 --> 32:15.508
we've got the reporting part down. What we do have issues

32:15.594 --> 32:19.476
in, I think, as I've mentioned previously, is that while the Hot teams can do

32:19.498 --> 32:23.092
a certain level of the Abatement side of our work, the actual code

32:23.146 --> 32:26.660
enforcement side is a specialized skill and profession that, unfortunately,

32:26.740 --> 32:29.864
you all are not able to do. And so in order for us to do

32:29.902 --> 32:33.416
our job as under chapter ten, which is to go out and give the

32:33.438 --> 32:36.748
official notices and then to write the citations, and hopefully the

32:36.754 --> 32:40.510
citations will be yeah, can they help with that?

32:40.880 --> 32:44.284
Is there a way what is the training entail? Like, how much training is

32:44.322 --> 32:47.484
involved in that? Oh, well, sure. It's no. Problem?

32:47.602 --> 32:51.372
Well, first and foremost, I I think think what you're asking is, are they qualified

32:51.436 --> 32:56.172
to also be code enforcement officers? What can we do to certify

32:56.236 --> 33:00.092
them as such so that you can have more personnel? They can't be certified

33:00.156 --> 33:03.312
outside of the Department of Neighborhoods? They would have to be employees of this department,

33:03.376 --> 33:06.896
because under the code into the city's charter, this department

33:07.008 --> 33:10.436
is the one that actually works specifically for that area. So if they

33:10.458 --> 33:13.764
become code enforcement officers, they'd have to become employees of this department

33:13.812 --> 33:17.684
to do that. And right now, they are employees

33:17.732 --> 33:20.632
of solid waste, I believe.

33:20.686 --> 33:23.850
So through attempt service.

33:25.040 --> 33:28.204
Yeah. It just seems like these are things that we should be able to be

33:28.242 --> 33:32.424
more creative with when it comes to utilizing

33:32.472 --> 33:35.516
personnel more efficiently to streamline the

33:35.538 --> 33:39.660
process. So if we can have some type of overview

33:39.740 --> 33:43.040
on what, in a hypothetical sense,

33:43.110 --> 33:46.988
could be done to utilize our code enforcement officers, to utilize

33:47.004 --> 33:50.660
our hot team to assist with code enforcement, that would be helpful.

33:51.160 --> 33:54.916
And I'd love to continue that conversation, but just let

33:54.938 --> 33:59.140
me reiterate that the work your teams are already doing is helpful.

33:59.480 --> 34:02.792
Yeah, I understand it may be helpful, but we want to find

34:02.846 --> 34:07.768
ways to have more enforcement without

34:07.854 --> 34:11.370
having to maybe go through the same traditional means of

34:11.900 --> 34:15.396
having to hire more code enforcement officers. Or if you're

34:15.428 --> 34:19.180
saying that the average pay is, like, 35,000 and that's below standard,

34:19.250 --> 34:21.708
well, what can we do with the people who are already out there in the

34:21.714 --> 34:25.676
neighborhoods to help? Possibly we

34:25.698 --> 34:29.164
could look at an opportunity for you to use

34:29.202 --> 34:32.736
some of your CDSF funds towards a particular team for your

34:32.758 --> 34:36.112
area, but they would become employees of the Department of Neighborhoods that we would train,

34:36.166 --> 34:38.930
and then they could be specific to your area. That's an opportunity.

34:40.260 --> 34:43.824
Okay, well, let's keep discussing it. Absolutely. All right. Thank you, council Member

34:43.872 --> 34:44.900
Abby Cayman.

34:53.470 --> 34:57.490
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. And apologies for my tardiness.

34:57.670 --> 35:01.934
I, one wanted to first recognize and thank

35:02.132 --> 35:05.802
your team, and I know that Jack and Rhonda specifically

35:05.866 --> 35:09.390
work within our district very heavily,

35:09.810 --> 35:13.390
but to everyone I know, everyone's short staffed and things of that nature,

35:13.550 --> 35:16.580
my staff may have already asked this. If not,

35:17.510 --> 35:20.340
I'm asking every department this question. Okay.

35:21.670 --> 35:25.174
Due to the financial constraints and

35:25.212 --> 35:28.790
challenges that the city continues to face from

35:28.860 --> 35:32.120
revenue caps, from other budgetary issues,

35:32.810 --> 35:36.742
what are the needs that you are not

35:36.796 --> 35:40.186
able to address right now in the department that you would like to

35:40.208 --> 35:43.834
see address or feel that there is a need for? I think

35:43.872 --> 35:47.710
the overwhelming theme at this point, council Member, is the

35:47.780 --> 35:50.830
funds put towards abatement and correction.

35:51.490 --> 35:54.862
Realistically, for a city the size of Houston, 50 code

35:54.916 --> 35:58.250
enforcement officers is abysmal,

35:58.410 --> 36:01.530
and we need more boots on the ground. But realistically,

36:01.610 --> 36:04.606
we're not going to get an additional 200 people tomorrow.

36:04.718 --> 36:08.126
So I'm not banging that drum today. However, the drum

36:08.158 --> 36:12.014
I will bang is that we have been very effective in utilizing our Abatement

36:12.062 --> 36:16.514
funds to be able to correct the issues, to lean those properties.

36:16.642 --> 36:20.086
And I think internally, our ability to do that and have

36:20.108 --> 36:24.086
the funds there to correct those issues and then also making sure that as

36:24.108 --> 36:28.018
a city, that we are foreclosing on these liens and recouping that money

36:28.124 --> 36:32.026
may actually create the revenue we need to bring in the additional bodies down

36:32.048 --> 36:35.338
the line. So that would be my response. Thank you.

36:35.424 --> 36:39.002
Thank you. Thank you. We have seven total

36:39.056 --> 36:42.394
speakers, public speakers signed up, only one virtual.

36:42.442 --> 36:44.526
So I'm not sure how we're going to do with the in person one,

36:44.548 --> 36:47.280
but we'll start with Mr. Doug Smith. Okay.

36:47.890 --> 36:52.338
Do we need to move? Do you need us to move, Mr okay.

36:52.504 --> 36:55.380
Star six, can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you.

36:56.230 --> 36:59.742
Okay. Sorry about the sorry about the camera earlier.

36:59.806 --> 37:03.666
I had turned it off and logged out and forgot

37:03.698 --> 37:06.630
to turn it back on. But apologize.

37:07.130 --> 37:10.742
This department probably is the one

37:10.796 --> 37:14.438
I care about most because I care about my neighborhood so much.

37:14.604 --> 37:18.342
And I am going to ask today for some council member

37:18.406 --> 37:22.426
to submit an amendment to the budget to add

37:22.528 --> 37:25.930
some employees, maybe several employees, maybe ten, or maybe 20

37:26.000 --> 37:29.530
employees. When you look at the budget, nearly every other department

37:29.610 --> 37:33.454
is adding employees, and this department is cutting full

37:33.492 --> 37:37.674
time equivalents. And I don't understand, given the results

37:37.722 --> 37:41.986
of their statistics on page 520,

37:42.168 --> 37:46.114
why they're not doing this. It's almost like we don't care

37:46.152 --> 37:49.410
about the neighborhoods, which I know is not the case. And also,

37:49.480 --> 37:52.834
you talked about enforcing Abatement the end of last

37:52.872 --> 37:56.370
year, you had $150,000,000 in unpaid liens.

37:56.530 --> 38:00.066
That whole process for me, from having personally

38:00.098 --> 38:03.654
lived through it this year with the junk trailer that you all know about,

38:03.772 --> 38:06.874
is you don't have enough teeth in that process,

38:06.992 --> 38:10.378
and you need to do something about that to improve it.

38:10.464 --> 38:13.100
So how would you address those two things?

38:17.650 --> 38:20.320
Mr. Smith, was that question directed at me?

38:21.650 --> 38:25.360
Yes or council members? Either or

38:25.970 --> 38:29.438
yes. I certainly am going to address why are

38:29.444 --> 38:33.234
we not asking? I would

38:33.272 --> 38:36.946
recommend working with your council member to put an amendment through and identify a

38:36.968 --> 38:38.130
funding source.

38:40.230 --> 38:43.286
Okay. But I do want to ask her why she

38:43.308 --> 38:47.510
didn't ask for more employees when every other department is getting substantial

38:47.930 --> 38:48.950
FTEs.

38:52.710 --> 38:56.110
Okay. So, Mr. Smith, I apologize.

38:56.190 --> 38:58.740
Please repeat your last question, and I'm happy to answer it.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.570
He wants to know why your FTEs drops. And I think in your presentation,

39:03.650 --> 39:07.126
you answered it and you said that you were not competitive with salary. Until we

39:07.148 --> 39:09.980
do something about that, we're not going to be able to attract them.

39:11.230 --> 39:15.046
Am I correct? Yes. Okay. Yes, that will be correct. You limited three positions

39:15.078 --> 39:18.410
in order to make those increases happen. Thank you, Mr. Sims.

39:20.190 --> 39:21.530
Jason Oliver?

39:28.940 --> 39:32.440
Yes. You may want to step back

39:32.510 --> 39:34.490
and go over where your team.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.950
Okay, thank you. All right.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.630
Thank you. So hi. Thank you.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.652
I agree with Doug. The Department of Neighborhoods

39:52.716 --> 39:56.796
is really important, and I hear year after year, right. We need hundreds

39:56.828 --> 40:00.076
of code enforcement officers. We need really hundreds

40:00.108 --> 40:03.312
of people doing the assistance office and literally, like,

40:03.366 --> 40:07.184
everything. And so

40:07.302 --> 40:11.044
I want to follow up on what what Doug asked in terms of how

40:11.082 --> 40:14.696
do you decide what to ask for in

40:14.718 --> 40:18.264
terms of asking for a smaller number instead of

40:18.302 --> 40:22.184
asking for a larger budget for this fiscal year and

40:22.222 --> 40:25.944
more personnel? And then I'm looking at your

40:26.062 --> 40:29.852
budget for the kind of gang prevention salaries is

40:29.906 --> 40:33.644
lower than any actuals from the past five years, and then over

40:33.762 --> 40:37.496
25% lower than, like, five years ago. The actuals

40:37.608 --> 40:40.956
what does this significant decrease mean for service delivery

40:41.068 --> 40:45.116
when there's a big need, particularly right now, for more youth programs?

40:45.308 --> 40:48.800
And then I just want to say we have people who are

40:48.870 --> 40:52.576
showing up to speak just in person. And I know

40:52.598 --> 40:55.956
that was trying to figure out how do people sign up if they

40:55.978 --> 40:59.396
show up to speak in person before the meeting, who do

40:59.418 --> 41:03.956
they go to? They have a write in sheet over

41:03.978 --> 41:07.080
there on the front right side of the room. Okay, perfect.

41:07.150 --> 41:11.464
That's good to know. Thank you. Okay, so first

41:11.502 --> 41:15.764
question, Mr. Oliver. And actually, it might be a little bit easier let's switch,

41:15.812 --> 41:17.976
if you don't mind. I don't want to do that. Come on up, Mr.

41:17.998 --> 41:21.596
Oliver. I want to answer your question directly, so while you're coming up, how we

41:21.618 --> 41:25.084
determine our priorities. As a department director, it's my

41:25.122 --> 41:27.992
responsibility to, of course, look at the needs of my department,

41:28.136 --> 41:31.804
but also as a I'm Team

41:31.842 --> 41:35.196
Don all day. Right. But I am also a part

41:35.218 --> 41:38.476
of Team City of Houston, so I have to not only be familiar

41:38.508 --> 41:40.688
with what the needs are in my department, but I have to be able to

41:40.694 --> 41:43.556
look at the broader landscape of where the priorities of the city are, and I

41:43.578 --> 41:47.236
don't determine those. And so to your point about why

41:47.258 --> 41:50.804
I've not asked for additional money this year

41:51.002 --> 41:54.356
for additional code enforcement officers is because,

41:54.458 --> 41:57.976
as you've mentioned before, every year I mentioned the need for that.

41:58.078 --> 42:01.816
And so I am confident that where we are able to

42:01.838 --> 42:05.492
make those concessions within the overall picture of the budget, the administration

42:05.556 --> 42:08.984
sees an opportunity. We keep a constant conversation throughout the year

42:09.022 --> 42:12.456
about this. So this isn't the only time I bang the drum. If those funds

42:12.488 --> 42:15.644
have become available and there are ways that we can do that to bring on

42:15.682 --> 42:19.272
additional people, then those are things that I've worked with the administration

42:19.336 --> 42:22.992
to do, which is why we actually have more positions now.

42:23.126 --> 42:26.656
Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, we are not able to be

42:26.678 --> 42:30.336
as competitive as we would like to be. And not to mention the fact that

42:30.358 --> 42:33.584
this is a particular area where most people kind

42:33.622 --> 42:37.124
of happen into it. So one of the things that I've talked to my team

42:37.162 --> 42:40.836
about is where we may need to up our recruitment game to let people know

42:40.858 --> 42:44.736
that this is another opportunity that they can look at as a paraprofessional

42:44.768 --> 42:48.792
opportunity. So it's not for lack of

42:48.846 --> 42:52.248
caring about that, but it's also just the fact that when I

42:52.254 --> 42:55.656
look at the grand scheme of the city's needs, I'm not saying our

42:55.678 --> 42:59.112
needs are not important, but I'm also realistic in what I can

42:59.166 --> 43:03.004
ask for at what particular time, and as I'm setting the priorities for the

43:03.042 --> 43:06.856
office. As I mentioned before to Vice Mayor Pro TEM, when we receive concerns

43:06.888 --> 43:11.276
from citizens like you and other people, ultimately you

43:11.298 --> 43:15.232
don't care if someone is inspected five or six times. What you want

43:15.286 --> 43:18.588
is I don't want to see it anymore. I want it corrected.

43:18.684 --> 43:22.304
So what is more attainable at this time is to actually get

43:22.342 --> 43:26.324
more money towards my budget to correct and for us to actually put

43:26.362 --> 43:29.876
more emphasis on the city, recouping those funds so that I can have a

43:29.898 --> 43:33.396
long game approach to bringing in more revenue to my department, to be

43:33.418 --> 43:36.760
able to bring in the people that I need based on revenue that's not available

43:36.830 --> 43:40.392
now. Thank you. Thank you. Your time

43:40.446 --> 43:44.010
has expired, and then it comes back.

43:45.500 --> 43:49.064
I don't think you'll find of the 23 departments that will present any department

43:49.112 --> 43:54.300
that says they have more than enough money to do the proper job

43:54.370 --> 44:01.048
that they were signed up to do. Aris Brown vicky

martin saba

44:05.688 --> 44:12.270
Blanding Hi.

44:15.040 --> 44:19.072
Good afternoon. Yeah, I don't have to hit mute. Six star

44:19.126 --> 44:22.784
six. Okay. The Office of New Americans has a very small

44:22.822 --> 44:26.236
budget. We've all established, and you've

44:26.268 --> 44:29.676
talked about how hard you're working with little staff and not

44:29.718 --> 44:33.060
enough compensation. I think we can do better. City of Houston,

44:33.560 --> 44:37.364
what needs have you seen for immigrant communities during the pandemic that more

44:37.402 --> 44:40.100
resources could help you all address? Wow. So,

44:40.170 --> 44:43.608
needless to say, I think that we've seen an increase in needs,

44:43.694 --> 44:47.272
especially with Title 42 and the Biden administration looking

44:47.326 --> 44:50.776
at a review of that. We are facing up to

44:50.798 --> 44:54.228
maybe 15,000 migrants possibly crossing the border.

44:54.324 --> 44:58.008
So what we have been able to do with the Office of New Americans

44:58.024 --> 45:01.564
and immigrant communities, we have great relationships with our nonprofit partners who

45:01.602 --> 45:05.340
actually facilitate a lot of the programming that we're able to do.

45:05.490 --> 45:09.244
Needless to say, to help corroborate what you mentioned earlier,

45:09.292 --> 45:12.912
we could definitely always use additional staff, but what we're doing right now

45:12.966 --> 45:17.212
is really just trying to use our nonprofit partnerships as a force multiplier

45:17.276 --> 45:20.390
to meet the needs of our immigrant community. And right now,

45:20.760 --> 45:24.644
that is the biggest and most pressing issue that we have before us right now.

45:24.842 --> 45:27.584
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Blinding. Joe.

45:27.632 --> 45:31.764
Rochelle, did I pronounce that correctly?

45:31.812 --> 45:35.320
You did. Thank you. Hi.

45:35.470 --> 45:39.192
Thank you for your presentation. I very much appreciate it. Thank you.

45:39.326 --> 45:43.588
Following on what Council Member Acorn said, you spoke about turnover.

45:43.684 --> 45:47.324
Yes. So how do you plan to address the turnover and keep

45:47.362 --> 45:51.004
the people that you already have? Since I understand that we don't have

45:51.042 --> 45:54.492
competitive salary, and you had mentioned too, about how

45:54.626 --> 45:58.396
are people too hot when they're out there, what are those different things? How do

45:58.418 --> 46:01.344
you prevent, try and keep the people that you already have?

46:01.462 --> 46:05.216
Well, one of the things that is always essential for me as a director is

46:05.238 --> 46:09.116
to always tell people thank you. That goes a long way. And public servants

46:09.228 --> 46:12.740
don't always feel appreciated for what they do. So we definitely

46:12.810 --> 46:16.676
want to make sure that they feel appreciated and not overlooked day to day.

46:16.778 --> 46:20.452
More practically, what we have been able to do is, as Mr.

46:20.506 --> 46:23.736
Sims, my assistant director, mentioned earlier, we have been

46:23.758 --> 46:27.524
able to use some of our vacancies to move forward in some promotion

46:27.572 --> 46:31.396
opportunities. Because at this point, looking at what we're

46:31.428 --> 46:35.052
dealing with collectively as a country coupled with inflation, my mind

46:35.106 --> 46:39.176
has turned more towards retention because I have amazing staff

46:39.288 --> 46:43.180
and invaluable people. So we're looking at different

46:43.250 --> 46:46.732
ways to reward those individuals who are already

46:46.786 --> 46:50.576
doing the job of two people or more. And that's what

46:50.598 --> 46:53.596
we're planning to do, as well as look at another way as a department,

46:53.708 --> 46:57.172
we could be stronger on recruiting people to this profession. Thank you.

46:57.226 --> 47:00.640
Let me see. Thank you, Ms. Grochell. Mr. Butler.

47:00.720 --> 47:01.590
You're welcome,

47:10.670 --> 47:14.026
Director. Hi. Good afternoon. Hi. My name is Broderick Butler. I'm from

47:14.048 --> 47:17.886
northeast Houston. And because of the time, I'm just going to sort

47:17.908 --> 47:21.150
of get to it. I'm going to read my questions and

47:21.220 --> 47:24.794
the three minutes that I have, and I'll let the director 1 minute. Yes.

47:24.932 --> 47:28.830
Sorry. So basically, you have a backlog of cases,

47:28.910 --> 47:32.414
yes or no? You've clarified vacancies

47:32.462 --> 47:35.310
were due to the high turnover rate, not resignations.

47:35.470 --> 47:38.854
So how are you able to complete your goal without putting a burden on

47:38.892 --> 47:42.630
remaining employees? Would more inspectors be assigned to specific

47:42.700 --> 47:47.026
designated areas, such as Council Member Tatum suggested, instead of rotating

47:47.058 --> 47:50.598
them be better due to your high number of turnover? It was pointed out

47:50.604 --> 47:54.918
to me that it appears this is an all hands on deck situation at dawn.

47:55.094 --> 47:58.618
Has senior management staff considered interacting with the public?

47:58.784 --> 48:02.426
And those are the questions that I have, because the way this

48:02.448 --> 48:06.382
is set up, it looks like a potential failure. I don't think that they will

48:06.516 --> 48:10.222
fail, but it is set up to where if you

48:10.356 --> 48:13.406
don't have enough to get the job done at the end of the day,

48:13.508 --> 48:16.980
regardless, it puts you in a very difficult situation,

48:17.750 --> 48:21.502
Mr. Butler. So we have backlog of cases,

48:21.566 --> 48:24.020
more inspectors, and interaction with public.

48:24.550 --> 48:28.066
Got it. So no problem. Thank you so much. Do we have

48:28.088 --> 48:31.478
a backlog in our cases? Actually, we are current, according to

48:31.484 --> 48:35.714
the mayor's dashboard, I believe, at 90 some odd

48:35.762 --> 48:39.378
percent in terms of our performance measures and meeting the first inspection.

48:39.554 --> 48:43.202
So because we don't have enough people, we do have a backlog

48:43.266 --> 48:46.346
of our Abatement cases. So once we've inspected and

48:46.368 --> 48:49.626
go back out, then we definitely have a backlog there. How are we going

48:49.648 --> 48:53.226
to deal with that? I'm going to utilize my current budget to spend what needs

48:53.248 --> 48:56.542
to be spent to correct it and ask for additional funds if they are available.

48:56.676 --> 49:00.590
When you mentioned before, vacancies are due high to turnover rates and

49:00.660 --> 49:04.446
not resignations. Yes, turnover is because people have been kind of coming in and

49:04.468 --> 49:08.178
going back out, and this is not something that is particular

49:08.264 --> 49:12.062
to the Department of Neighborhoods currently. Our country is dealing with a great resignation

49:12.126 --> 49:15.634
where people are looking for different opportunities with more flexibility that,

49:15.672 --> 49:19.166
quite frankly, this particular role cannot offer. When you're

49:19.198 --> 49:23.186
looking at how do we complete our goals without putting a burden on remaining

49:23.218 --> 49:27.314
employees, we absolutely cannot complete our goals without putting an additional burden

49:27.362 --> 49:31.554
on everybody, and that includes me. So all of us are working several positions

49:31.602 --> 49:35.066
so that we can accomplish what we're needing to accomplish. And that's why I

49:35.088 --> 49:37.994
love my team, because they do it from a great place and a love of

49:38.032 --> 49:41.446
community. They're very flexible, and they do the extra that is required.

49:41.558 --> 49:44.822
Would Morris inspectors be assigned to specific designated areas?

49:44.886 --> 49:48.254
Absolutely. If I had the inspectors that I would ideally like

49:48.292 --> 49:51.870
to have, every area, every district, every neighborhood would have a specific

49:51.940 --> 49:54.974
team. But because I do not, then we have to put them where the need

49:55.012 --> 49:58.526
is greatest, and we have to rotate them as necessary.

49:58.638 --> 50:02.206
It is an all hands on deck situation. Senior management

50:02.238 --> 50:05.874
staff is always interacting with the public, and if you

50:05.912 --> 50:08.386
have not seen us enough, let me know, and I will come and see you

50:08.408 --> 50:11.554
myself. Personally, however, it's always an on

50:11.592 --> 50:14.854
hands on deck situation with Don. But what I'm happy to

50:14.892 --> 50:18.086
report is that we put all hands, feet, fingers, and toes in

50:18.108 --> 50:21.074
the work that we need to get done. Thank you. With all due respect,

50:21.122 --> 50:24.634
though, I unfortunately do not see that in my community as I speak

50:24.752 --> 50:27.770
to citizens as we go about our daily business.

50:27.920 --> 50:31.834
But I always hope that one people can do better.

50:31.952 --> 50:35.246
Thank you. Thank you so much. And I invite you to visit with me at

50:35.268 --> 50:38.800
your leisure so we can talk about your specific issues. In what area?

50:39.170 --> 50:42.398
Northeast Houston. Cynical at 77016.

50:42.484 --> 50:45.250
Thank you so much. Ms. Melissa Martinez.

50:57.100 --> 51:00.304
Hi, how are you? Good afternoon,

51:00.372 --> 51:04.616
everyone. Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions I'm

51:04.648 --> 51:07.864
interested in overall, just on accessibility,

51:07.912 --> 51:11.436
on how to make the Neighborhoods grants more accessible, and who has

51:11.458 --> 51:14.904
the authority to change the nonprofit eligibility requirement for neighborhood

51:14.952 --> 51:18.624
grants? So that's my first, and then I have a second. Why do the

51:18.662 --> 51:21.984
neighborhood grants operate on a reimbursement model? And who has the

51:22.022 --> 51:24.976
authority to change that as well? By requiring people to pay out of pocket.

51:25.008 --> 51:28.544
It significantly limits the applicant pool. And I want to add more context

51:28.592 --> 51:32.020
to that, that for folks in communities.

51:34.440 --> 51:38.260
Not everyone has the same background, whether it's academic or

51:38.410 --> 51:42.104
salary wise, to be able who want to create change of

51:42.142 --> 51:46.216
a project within their own district. And that

51:46.238 --> 51:49.348
is why I'm interested in with these questions on how we can invest in our

51:49.374 --> 51:52.796
community members to have the ability to create change in their own

51:52.818 --> 51:57.336
backyards and not just in other proposals

51:57.368 --> 52:00.396
for more. To me,

52:00.418 --> 52:03.708
that is public safety. Okay, that's a fair question.

52:03.794 --> 52:07.516
So the requirements around neighborhood matching grants,

52:07.548 --> 52:10.576
at one point in time prior to my coming on as director, there was a

52:10.598 --> 52:14.204
specific pool of money that was given to the department to actually deliver

52:14.252 --> 52:17.920
this program. As I understand it, it's always been a reimbursable program

52:17.990 --> 52:21.860
where we're matching funds that are coming in from the community. I do understand

52:21.930 --> 52:25.604
your concern about that not being as accessible for some individuals. However,

52:25.722 --> 52:28.468
what I found is that when people have teeth in the game, they tend to

52:28.474 --> 52:32.596
be a little bit better about maintaining and organizing and actually keeping

52:32.628 --> 52:36.056
up those beautification processes. The other part is that because

52:36.158 --> 52:39.976
now we don't currently have that pot of money, what we do to keep the

52:39.998 --> 52:43.092
program going is we assist the council members offices,

52:43.156 --> 52:46.636
which is the source of funding. So the source of funding for

52:46.658 --> 52:49.992
our matching grant program now comes from the council district service funds.

52:50.056 --> 52:53.484
The council members choose the projects that they would like to or can afford

52:53.532 --> 52:57.184
to actually fund for that year.

52:57.302 --> 53:02.156
And because of the fact that these are taxpayer

53:02.188 --> 53:05.756
dollars, there's a specific way that we have to actually deal with taxpayer

53:05.788 --> 53:08.864
dollars, which means we can't give that out to individuals. It would have to be

53:08.902 --> 53:12.180
the nonprofit protections that are offered, which is the reason why it is specific

53:12.250 --> 53:15.476
to 501 C, three S in receiving the money. So we're not trying

53:15.498 --> 53:18.996
to make it extra difficult, but legally, we have certain parameters we have

53:19.018 --> 53:21.880
to follow as a city if we're going to put taxpayer dollars towards a specific

53:21.950 --> 53:26.296
project. So I hope that answers your question. Thank you.

53:26.398 --> 53:27.930
Question thank you.

53:29.500 --> 53:33.180
No, ma'am, your time has expired. Thank you. You can submit the question

53:33.250 --> 53:36.604
in writing, and we will have the

53:36.642 --> 53:40.156
ability to have your council member get back in touch with

53:40.178 --> 53:44.220
you. Okay. So before we dismiss

53:44.980 --> 53:48.672
Vice Mayor Pro TEM martha Castex Tatum. Yes. I just have one more question.

53:48.726 --> 53:51.980
Do we have any code enforcement officers that work on weekends?

53:52.140 --> 53:55.488
No. Okay. Thank you.

53:55.654 --> 53:58.930
Thank you. But that's a great idea. One, we've been working for it,

54:00.180 --> 54:03.472
and as you said to your people thank you.

54:03.526 --> 54:06.824
Thank you to you and Director Sims and all your staff. So thank you.

54:06.902 --> 54:09.880
Thank you, Chair. And another reminder, public,

54:09.950 --> 54:13.304
if you have questions, you can always locate those into

54:13.342 --> 54:16.856
your council members and then you'll have the ability for them to

54:16.878 --> 54:20.390
provide the additional response back to you. So thank you. Thank you.
