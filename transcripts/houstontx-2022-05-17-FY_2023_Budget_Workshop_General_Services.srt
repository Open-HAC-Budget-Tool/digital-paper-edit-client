You all do a great job day in and day out, so thank you for

42
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,170
what you do. Except you, Eric.

43
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,940
That's my man.

44
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,900
All right.

45
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,816
Can you hear me? All right. There it is. Good morning and thank

46
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:03,116
you for the opportunity to present the fiscal year 2023 budget for

47
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:06,604
the General Services Department. I have three principles that I share

48
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:09,952
with our GSD team, and that's integrity. First, service before

49
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:12,210
self and excellence in all we do.

50
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,048

any financial questions regarding the fiscal year 23 proposed

61
00:03:57,272 --> 00:04:00,080
budget. Next slide.

62
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,824
GSD operations are divided into four core programs of

63
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,808
service one, property and environmental management two,

64
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:13,140
design and construction and real estate services three

65
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,432
security management and four, administrative,

66
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:20,544
financial and energy management services with the primary goals

67
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:24,950
of reducing costs and continuing to improve our level of customer service.

68
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,472
Our current organizational structure shows our total

69
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:32,552
operating budget for the General Fund to be just over $42.1

70
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,040
million with 154 FTEs.

71
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,980
Next slide.

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,044
The project cost recovery fund has a proposed budget of

73
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:47,256
$6.8 million with 51 FTEs.

74
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:51,648
All expenses in this fund are charged back to the Capital Improvement Plan

75
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:56,048
or CIP, Bond funds. The FTEs in this fund provide

76
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:59,552
CIP planning, management, manage the design

77
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:02,816
and construction facilities for all departments except

78
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:06,544
the Houston Airport System, manage the CIP construction

79
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:10,180
contracts, and facilitate tenant moves and improvements.

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,276
By mid September this year, we will be complete with the A leaf

81
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:18,244
neighborhood center and the maintenance and operational costs are included

82
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:21,480
in our FY 2023 proposed budget.

83
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,080
Next slide.

84
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,984
The Maintenance, Renewal and Replacement, or MRR

85
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:32,700
fund has a proposed budget of $30.77

86
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,856
million and 76 FTEs. This fund provides

87
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:40,588
for the maintenance, repair and replacement of building systems and operational

88
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,772
components for mechanical, electrical, plumbing,

89
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,972
HVAC, life, safety, security, monitoring,

90
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:49,680
structural and energy systems.

91
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,170
Next,

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,524
in our General Fund revenue budget, there's an increase of

93
00:05:57,562 --> 00:06:01,280
$29,000 due to an escalations on rents

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,220
that GSD collects and an increase of $19,000

95
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,256
due to an increase in planned projects that will be charged back to the

96
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:13,176
Fleet Department and Parking Management. General Services will

97
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:17,020
continue to charge back its personnel costs for operations of public works

98
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,016
facilities. There is a decrease in miscellaneous

99
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,940
revenue as we do not budget for possible recoveries and

100
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,070
refunds. Next.

101
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,610
Our General Fund revenue is budgeted at 3.9 million

102
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,880
with changes as discussed in the previous slide. Our Project

103
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,544
Recovery Fund revenue is budgeted at just under $6.8

104
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:46,052
million, an increase of $1.6 million

105
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:50,432
due to the hiring of additional project managers and support personnel.

106
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:54,384
During fiscal year 22, our in house renovation

107
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:58,724
group budget was decreased to zero due to this group being dissolved

108
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:02,532
and FTEs being moved to the General Fund or MRR.

109
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:05,716
Fund. Our MRR revenue is budgeted

110
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:09,784
at $29.8 million, which is the same as the FY

111
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:13,224
22 adopted budget. The increase

112
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:16,744
over fiscal year 21 is primarily due to finance

113
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:20,524
reducing the revenue transferred into the Fund in FY

114
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:23,836
21 to assist with the FY 21 budget

115
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:26,480
deficit. Next slide.

116
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,316
For FY 23, we are proposing an expenditure budget

117
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:35,460
in our General Fund of $42.2 million.

118
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,536
The restricted accounts include service chargeback accounts for items

119
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:42,960
such as fuel, electricity, It accounts,

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,120
et cetera. Next slide.

121
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,000
The total proposed budget for all funds for fiscal year 2023

122
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,320
is $79.6 million. Next slide.

123
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,064
In the General Fund, the $28.3 million nonpersonal

124
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:08,652
costs make up roughly 67% of the General Fund

125
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:11,864
budget. Restricted accounts represent roughly

126
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:15,768
38% of the total nonpersonal costs.

127
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:19,884
The remaining nonpersonal budget is for services such as janitorial

128
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,350
services, security management, sewer services,

129
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,580
real estate rentals and landscaping.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,376
Next, the Project Cost Recovery

131
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:35,128
Fund personnel costs make up 97% of

132
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:38,212
the budget, with restricted accounts and miscellaneous

133
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:40,890
services making up the remaining 3%.

134
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,330
Next,

135
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,324
in the MRR Fund, the $23.7

136
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:52,844
million in nonpersonal costs make up 77.2%

137
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:56,780
of the budget. Of this, $21.2 million,

138
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,316
or 89.6% is budgeted

139
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:04,704
for services and $2.4 million, or 10.4%,

140
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:08,290
is budgeted for supplies. Next.

141
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,212
GSD's fiscal year 22 adopted budget was $41.9

142
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:18,352
million. With the fiscal year 2022 budget adjustments,

143
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,984
our projected current General Fund budget

144
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:25,556
is now $41.6 million. In the

145
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:29,652
General Fund, we are proposing an FY 2023 expenditure budget

146
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:33,256
of $42.1 million. As noted on the

147
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,536
exhibit, this includes the adjustments for the opening of

148
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:40,360
the A Leaf Neighborhood Center and contractual and operational

149
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,590
adjustments. Next,

150
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,472
this graph shows the previous five years budgets compared

151
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:52,296
to our proposed FY 23 budget. The increase

152
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:55,948
in the budget from FY 22 to 23 is due

153
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:59,612
to the 3% Hope increase, as well as the additional budget

154
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:02,912
for operational and maintenance of the new A Leaf Neighborhood

155
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:06,548
Center. This concludes our presentations. Do you

156
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:10,132
have any questions, sir? We sure

157
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:14,500
do, and thanks for the presentation. We'll start off with council member Abby Cayman.

158
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,610
Good morning, Director, and thank you again to you and your entire team.

159
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,848
You all are often behind the scenes, but we can't get anything done if we

160
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:27,192
don't have the structural integrity to do so.

161
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:30,844
So thank you all. Director, three quick

162
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:34,204
questions for you. One, can you provide a quick update to

163
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:37,612
us? I know we're getting going

164
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,996
on construction for the annex tunnel, things like that, but damages sustained

165
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:45,984
during Harvey. Where are we in that recovery process

166
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:50,144
for our buildings right now? And I'll speak first on City

167
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,776
Hall and City Hall annex, which you see every day. And you've

168
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:58,100
seen some significant improvement in the City Hall basement.

169
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,536
So I'll start with the tunnel. So the tunnel, if you've

170
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:07,896
noticed, on the Bagby Street side, there's a lot of digging and corriding to

171
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:11,780
find the source of the water intrusion into the tunnel.

172
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,704
Once we find that and the tunnel is sealed to

173
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,844
keep the water from intruding, that part of

174
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:22,430
the Harvey damage will start to be done

175
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,476
at City Hall. We're waiting for a

176
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:30,388
call today from the ceiling tile contractor, and we're keeping our fingers

177
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:33,772
crossed. As with everything in the nation,

178
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:38,028
COVID and the war in Ukraine has put a damper on receiving

179
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:41,664
materials. We were initially told the ceiling tiles for

180
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,152
the hallway and the mayor's conference room would be about

181
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,830
a twelve to 16 week lead time.

182
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,796
The contractor is waiting on a call. We believe we got that down to three

183
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:55,992
or four weeks. If that is true, we will be complete with the

184
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:58,440
basement by the end of June.

185
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,432
Kindle library is another. It's on track

186
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:07,000
to be finished sometime soon. So we're making

187
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,544
progress. But, again, we did run into delays

188
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:14,556
with COVID and then the war in Ukraine. No,

189
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:18,824
and I bring that up especially for the purposes for public knowledge

190
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,692
in terms of we're still working on everything from Harvey, and it's

191
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:26,080
been slow with Ukraine. And I know you all are working as quickly as possible,

192
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,256
but even on city properties, we're still

193
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:33,396
dealing with addressing a lot of those challenges. Right. And we look

194
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:36,484
at municipal courts. We are dealing with well,

195
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,052
not our office, but Finance and Mr.

196
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:43,600
Costello's group are dealing with FEMA for the funding

197
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,064
to replace municipal courts. And it's five

198
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:49,930
years later. Back in queue, please.

199
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,740
So you're getting off easy. There are no other questions from council members,

200
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,930
but I would like to state yeah, go ahead.

201
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,210
No one else is in queue. Okay.

202
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,970
Secondly director asking.

203
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,480
I got two more questions. Second Director,

204
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,816
you and your chief of staff and your entire staff,

205
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:19,356
I know, worked really diligently when an issue came up. And I was hoping you

206
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:23,272
could share with us the progress

207
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:27,360
that has been made in terms of healthcare coverage for our security personnel

208
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,232
and just all of the efforts that you and your team made

209
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:35,180
to make sure that we're doing right by our security personnel.

210
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,644
Sure. And if I can, I'll tell a little story on how this

211
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:41,264
came about. So, Council Member Cayman,

212
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:45,424
who talks to the security officers here on a daily basis,

213
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:49,364
noticed the security officer with a limp, and they talked

214
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:53,284
about going to see a doctor. And the security officer told

215
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:56,584
them that she didn't have medical insurance because it was too

216
00:13:56,622 --> 00:14:00,840
high. So the council member contacted my office, and we looked into

217
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,604
it, and we found a huge discrepancy with

218
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:08,524
the contractor as far as meeting the requirements for

219
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:12,172
payer play, and the contractor is good.

220
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,112
They met with us, we discussed the discrepancy.

221
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:18,672
And that was all started in December by

222
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:23,730
I think it was end of February or March. We had 199

223
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,180
security officers on the contract working here

224
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,350
at City Hall and City Hall Annex. Of that

225
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,840
199, only 33 of them were verified

226
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,492
to have any type of insurance coverage. With the help

227
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,000
of the insurance company and us getting them within compliance,

228
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,304
they moved that up totally with their insurance or

229
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,410
any other type of insurance, up to 162.

230
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,964
So we thank you for bringing it to us,

231
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:57,900
because it also discovered some discrepancies. We have

232
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,560
not only GSD, but dealings with SPD and Oboe

233
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,816
on maintaining the compliance of Pay or

234
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:09,244
Play, which we're working with those other departments to make sure the contractors

235
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:12,992
are within compliance. I appreciate that

236
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:17,344
update. And again, I credit you and your team for

237
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:20,804
all of the work that was done on that. I simply asked a question.

238
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:24,720
But the credit lies with you all and bringing them up finally, Director,

239
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,644
I'm asking every department, due to the financial constraints that

240
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:32,180
not only Council is facing, but the city as a whole is facing,

241
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,944
what are the needs that are not currently being

242
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:39,224
met by this budget and what are the foreseeable needs

243
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:43,020
in the near future. So what I've noticed in

244
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,524
my now almost six years of sitting in this

245
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:50,984
chair, and it's not just this administration, but it's past administrations

246
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:54,276
that we talk about deferred maintenance,

247
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:57,952
and where we are with deferred maintenance, and we're looking at a

248
00:15:58,006 --> 00:16:00,464
deferred maintenance bill of $594,000,000.

249
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:04,256
And that's huge.

250
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:08,612
And the only sector we can compare ourselves with

251
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,436
is the private sector. And the private sector tells us the

252
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:17,152
city should be given or putting X amount of money into capital

253
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:21,690
improvement and X amount of millions of dollars into

254
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,096
maintenance and operations. We receive less

255
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:31,064
than half of what they say we should, but we

256
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:35,260
do it what we can. But the funding

257
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,496
is needed. Being a retired policeman,

258
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:43,276
I tell Chief Fender I'm 100%, if you cut me,

259
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:47,170
I still bleed blue. And I tell Chief Pina wait a minute, it'll turn red.

260
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,730
And I understand those

261
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,968
ladies and gentlemen, the job they do, not many people do it,

262
00:16:56,054 --> 00:17:00,116
and they deserve what you give them. But we can't forget about the facilities they

263
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:01,350
have to work in.

264
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,516
Our biggest fear this year with the, as I

265
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:10,570
mentioned earlier about shipments being delayed is that we have

266
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,080
HVAC systems that fail,

267
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,620
that cannot be fixed and have to be replaced.

268
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,752
And then there's an eight to twelve week lead time

269
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:26,152
to get that equipment here. And then we have to rent temporary equipment.

270
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,996
Well, what we found is when we rent that temporary equipment for three or

271
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:33,256
four months, we could have bought two units that we're

272
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:37,756
replacing. So that's what hamstrings

273
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:38,370
us.

274
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,556
Thank you. I neglected to welcome council

275
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:50,416
member Mary NAN Hoffman, council member Robert Gallegos, and council member

276
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:53,572
David Robinson. They are here at the Horseshoe. Next question

277
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:57,140
comes from council member David Robinson and council member Tiffany D

278
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,020
Thomas.

279
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,828
Thank you, Council Member Robinson.

280
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:07,176
Thank you Chair. Thank you all for your presentation. And I

281
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:10,904
know the GSD is doing everything you can with

282
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:15,176
the delays, director, as you mentioned, with the global supply chain,

283
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:19,480
material shortages, construction schedules, cost inflation,

284
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,748
and the list goes on. I guess there's a bit of a

285
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:26,624
preview. I know coming up on a TTI committee meeting ahead is

286
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:30,496
some review of our deferred maintenance on some of

287
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:34,448
our facilities that are in your portfolio. So this is essentially extra

288
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:38,084
budgetary question, but something that

289
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:41,780
I'd like maybe some comment from you about the overall

290
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,080
impact of the delay in the global

291
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,500
supply set of conditions with

292
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,892
what we've been able to do. How you've been able to prioritize

293
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:57,380
the projects you have and what consequences

294
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,868
we as a city may be suffering in terms of a delay

295
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:04,140
on prioritized projects that you've had.

296
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,928
Some of us have had in our hoped

297
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:11,756
for list of priorities for your department and the city.

298
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:16,012
So there was a time here at City Hall

299
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:19,536
in the recent past where we had air handler units on

300
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,744
the corner of Walker and Bagby because we had an air

301
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:28,116
handler unit in the basement fail, and we

302
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:31,572
were given some serious lead time and

303
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:35,584
we have to think outside the box. Being former

304
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,092
military, I tell my guys, just because a

305
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:42,792
company says this, they're not the only people

306
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:46,440
in the United States that make this stuff. We have to go

307
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,976
elsewhere. We have to use whatever we can to speed the

308
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:53,068
process up. We've been lucky so far that

309
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,996
most of the lead times we've been given,

310
00:19:56,178 --> 00:20:00,188
we've been able to reduce by looking

311
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:01,180
elsewhere.

312
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,696
The impact to the city that this will

313
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:11,488
have if we meet run into these

314
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:15,456
long delays is we pay extra to

315
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:19,700
keep a building cool or warm. That's going to be our biggest

316
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,560
problem, is HVAC system failure.

317
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,308
We had an FCA done, as you know, in 2012,

318
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:32,356
which is outdated, and we have a current one that should be wrapped

319
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:36,088
up hopefully next month. That's going to give us a new light

320
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:38,650
on where our facilities stand.

321
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,848
Unfortunately, it's not any better than it was in 2012.

322
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:47,596
It's a lot worse. Let me say I appreciate that

323
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:51,356
last comment, especially about HVAC and some of what our buildings need

324
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:54,744
to do for an upgrade. It's also, in addition to

325
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:58,412
the costliness of it for our budget, it's also incredibly

326
00:20:58,476 --> 00:21:02,144
expensive from an environmental standpoint. What we're doing to

327
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:06,012
not upgrade our facilities is one of the biggest

328
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:10,224
degrees in which we're falling short of some of our climate action goals

329
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,376
and goals to align ourselves with the resilient.

330
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:16,756
Houston. True. That's one reason why I

331
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:21,352
went to the administration, asked to start

332
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:25,284
an energy efficiency section in GSD,

333
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:28,644
which is one person now, Shelley Carter, who's done an outstanding

334
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:31,996
job with the I think you're aware of the

335
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:35,148
CICO loan and the Seco project that we

336
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:38,588
about to kick off, which is the low hanging fruit of

337
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:42,190
Led lighting in five facilities to

338
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,596
start. I'll say start to meet those requirements.

339
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:49,564
Thank you, Chair, and I know we'll get an update of that at the upcoming

340
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:52,832
TTI committee meeting. So thanks for the view. Thank you,

341
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:54,720
Council Member Robert Gallegos.

342
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,244
Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Director, for the presentation. I know

343
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:04,036
I'm on my 9th year here on Council, and every year I do look

344
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:07,216
at the demographic breakdown of the different departments.

345
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:10,856
I'd like to give you kudos in regards to

346
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:14,536
the breakdown here on employees in

347
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,530
the department. It reflects our city.

348
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,368
But I would also ask if you can give me a breakdown on the

349
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:24,270
management of your department as well.

350
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,932
I'd like to review that if at all possible.

351
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:31,500
Okay. Thank you. Council Member Ed Pollard.

352
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,392
Thank you, Chair, and good morning to everyone. Director, thank you for your presentation.

353
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:39,410
Thank you to your entire team for all the work that you do.

354
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,228
If you had to put a dollar amount, let's say we could use some ARPA

355
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:47,090
dollars to go towards deferred maintenance and things that

356
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,464
would dramatically improve the state of our buildings and maintenance,

357
00:22:52,592 --> 00:22:56,070
what would that dollar amount be? A reasonable number.

358
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,220
You said dramatically improve.

359
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,040
Yeah, to dramatically improve.

360
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,770
I'll meet you halfway. 250,000,000.

361
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,046
Thank you. Thank you. There are

362
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:19,066
no other council members in queue. I have one comment and then a

363
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:22,774
question. There is no department in the city of Houston

364
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:26,394
that I interact with and probably many council members interact with

365
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:29,758
on a daily basis. Your department is phenomenal. And I know a

366
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:32,830
lot of this is under my friend Eric Alexander,

367
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,054
but the janitors that we have that do the hard work day

368
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:40,366
in and day out are always there with a smile and

369
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:44,050
a can do spirit. I miss miss Anna. Can you get it back across

370
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,634
the street? Because I love asking her about her dad and seeing how

371
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:51,026
he's doing. And John just does a great job.

372
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:54,722
And I remember when Neil was a security guard

373
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:58,406
and we hired him at GSD. Neil was the most respectful is the

374
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:01,814
most respectful. Yes, sir. No, sir, can do. Guy I've ever

375
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:05,574
met. Positive spirit, works his butt

376
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:09,958
off. He just exemplifies the employees

377
00:24:10,054 --> 00:24:12,406
that we have in the city of Houston.

378
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:16,090
And there's a famous saying,

379
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,774
fish rots from the head. So when there's a good head, the rest

380
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:23,514
of the employees will do a good job. And it's because of the executive

381
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,438
staff I'm looking at here. And thanks for doing everything

382
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:31,294
and doing the hard work. Those people are a joy

383
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:34,722
to be around. They make my life better today. It makes

384
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:37,266
me realize how lucky that I am,

385
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:40,946
personally. And just kudos to the people that

386
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:44,566
you have in your area that do the tough jobs day in and day

387
00:24:44,588 --> 00:24:47,894
out. I know it's not a sexy job, but, God,

388
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:51,586
they do fantastic work. So thanks for those folks.

389
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,886
My question is wrapped around deferred maintenance. What is

390
00:24:54,908 --> 00:24:58,442
our deferred maintenance backlog? Now, I know we did that study a while

391
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:02,540
back. What is the dollar amount? I know you gave a $250,000,000.

392
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,342
Say that again. 594,000,000. Say that again.

393
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:10,526
594,000,000.

394
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:14,542
It will increase. The estimate is in

395
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,606
2024. It'll stay pretty flat for next year or two,

396
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:23,060
but 2024, it will go up to 600 million plus.

397
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,802
So when you look at deferred maintenance, that's a lot of money to put into

398
00:25:26,856 --> 00:25:30,446
it. Seems like every day we have people working on our elevators.

399
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:34,854
But think big or go

400
00:25:34,892 --> 00:25:38,454
home. And I look at the land that we have that isn't in

401
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:42,406
much use next door to us. Tranquility park. Is it

402
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:45,722
a good park? Yeah, it's okay. It's not one of the better ones.

403
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:49,740
I'd love to see us build a new facility over there. Blow up.

404
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,786
Lanier, the building. That's a horrible building.

405
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:57,530
Horrible this building has its issues,

406
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,514
but it's an art deco building and it probably has a great historical

407
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:05,070
meaning to it. But the police building now, the horrible building.

408
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,920
I know we looked at something. The old exxon building.

409
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,380
God, this is probably five, six years ago.

410
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,822
Can the record reflect that the chair has appreciated historical

411
00:26:15,886 --> 00:26:19,586
architecture? I'd like to let the chair reflect that

412
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:23,522
from my architect friend. Thank you. Richard will appreciate that.

413
00:26:23,576 --> 00:26:26,994
But don't you think we need to one day look at a long term

414
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:31,042
plan and begin that so we get away from this deferred maintenance

415
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:35,082
and do something with building a new facility, maybe do a three P.

416
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:37,978
We've had a lot of conversations wrapped around that.

417
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:41,018
Just your thoughts. You've been around for many years.

418
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:45,210
There is a plan or there has been talk to

419
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,990
Renovate 611 Walker to do something

420
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,862
to do something different

421
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:56,350
at Tranquility Park. So there is a plan.

422
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,970
It's in the rough stages, but there's talk about doing

423
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,174
exactly that. So do you think it's an optimistic

424
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,374
plan or a realistic or a pessimistic?

425
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:11,118
No one else is in queue, so I'm going to do you think

426
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:15,026
we'll get it done because our deferred

427
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:18,854
maintenance gets bigger and bigger and bigger. That's a tough one because

428
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:22,710
the deferred maintenance is going to keep climbing, unfortunately,

429
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:28,586
and the prices are going to keep going up. So I

430
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:32,330
would be on the pessimistic side. Pessimistic. Okay, well,

431
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,214
we'll go to public speakers, but I always sort of kid mayor Turner,

432
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:40,442
I said we have a year and a half. What is your legacy?

433
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:43,694
Complete communities, things like that. I'd love to see the

434
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:47,678
Sylvester turn of building right across the street from us, housing a

435
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:51,066
lot of people that need a new place to be housed. So I'll

436
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:54,706
keep after them as long as you keep after them. Okay. Because I think there

437
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:58,850
is a plan. Council member Gallegos thank you, chair. Actually, there is a

438
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,338
master plan for Tranquility Park at the parks department.

439
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,278
Unfortunately, there's no monies for this master plan.

440
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:11,586
But that was something that I had seen way back when former

441
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:14,994
director Turner was the parks director.

442
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:18,618
And it's a really nice plan.

443
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:22,314
Unfortunately, there's no monies. But I do agree with you in regards to

444
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:25,978
the fountains as they're at Tranquility Park, I understand we're going to be

445
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:31,326
trying to repair those once again, but in

446
00:28:31,348 --> 00:28:34,782
my opinion, I think that's just a lot of money being wasted because they've tried

447
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:38,270
fixing that several times and they just keep breaking.

448
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,986
So hopefully we can come up with the master plan or

449
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:45,634
something that will save the city money instead of using it to

450
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:48,882
repair something that constantly keeps breaking. Thank you. Thank you,

451
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,918
council member. So before we go to public speakers,

452
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:55,202
yesterday, we let public speaking get a little bit away

453
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:58,726
from us. We'd like all the questions to be directed to council members. We'll do

454
00:28:58,748 --> 00:29:02,290
the best to try and answer them if we need some input from staff,

455
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,830
we'll do that. But we want the directors

456
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,738
to be focused on council members and public speakers to

457
00:29:09,744 --> 00:29:13,114
be focused on us as well. So with that being

458
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:17,674
said, I will ask you to exit stage Bright and

459
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:23,170
we will call on our first public speaker and that is Sabah

460
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,922
Blanding. And if I can add one thing, GSD,

461
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:30,782
we are looking outside of the box for funding.

462
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:34,434
We're actually meeting with Bill Kelly and his staff to see

463
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:38,340
if we can tap into some of the biden infrastructure bill

464
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,646
funding towards energy efficiency.

465
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:43,400
Just wanted to leave that.

466
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,758
Thank you. And Ms. Blanding, direct the questions to us and we

467
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:52,518
will field the questions from here. Okay. Good morning.

468
00:29:52,604 --> 00:29:56,086
My name is Saba Blanding. I'm a resident of

469
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:58,998
District I, so council member Gallegos's district.

470
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:03,114
My question is what environmental services and

471
00:30:03,152 --> 00:30:06,890
asbestos, lead, mold, soil remediation

472
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:11,626
are you able to accomplish on your current budget? 17 million seems fairly

473
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:16,270
low for such an essential safety work for property and environmental management.

474
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,990
What are the comprehensive needs of the city of Houston? What resources

475
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,962
would this department need to expand to address the full

476
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:28,850
needs of the city? And what are efforts to make sure these services

477
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,730
are addressed equitably across the city of Houston?

478
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,780
We just talked about deferred maintenance a minute ago.

479
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,130
You heard it heavy. Bill on deferred maintenance.

480
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,918
Keeping a building like this up to speed with environmental

481
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:47,450
friendly issues is really a tough task.

482
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,700
I think the direction that we should head would be to build a

483
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,826
lead platinum type facility that

484
00:30:56,848 --> 00:31:01,006
has all the things that you would want from an environmental standpoint and

485
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:04,366
then house various departments. We tried to do that a couple of

486
00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:07,914
years ago when we were in negotiations with the folks

487
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:11,906
who owned the old Exxon building down the street. But we had

488
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:15,458
a number of issues with it because of the access

489
00:31:15,544 --> 00:31:18,610
to it underground and having the tunnel system work.

490
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,322
But we don't do a very good job with

491
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:26,038
the environmental side because of the age of the buildings and the condition of

492
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:29,926
the buildings. But we should do better. And I think that will come

493
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:33,494
with our ability to possibly do what

494
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:37,674
council member Gallegos was talking about and that is to do a

495
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:41,466
new development that will house various departments within the city.

496
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:45,174
I don't know if any other council members have any. I'll defer

497
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:48,854
to my Black Cape architect,

498
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:52,846
David Robinson, who's in queue right now. Well, I think

499
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:56,446
you're right. I think there's just lots to be done with our

500
00:31:56,468 --> 00:32:00,126
existing facilities, which is why I wanted to mention to the director some

501
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:03,566
of those important aspects of deferred maintenance. But I think

502
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,994
this Blanding raises an important point, not only for the

503
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:11,198
issues already discussed with the cost of the mechanical systems,

504
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:15,286
the upgrade and the cost of the environment, but also just the

505
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,018
health impacts of all the users.

506
00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:22,294
So those are concerns that layer into how

507
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:26,374
I believe we should prioritize the facilities and think

508
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:29,786
about that carefully before we embark on any new programs and

509
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:33,622
new construction. But I share your feeling, Chair, about Tranquility

510
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:37,226
Park, and I know there are some plans that are coming forward. I believe the

511
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:40,542
mayor's got a few on his desk that he's considering about that right now.

512
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:44,074
That's great. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Blinding. Next was Jason

513
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:47,200
Oliver. I don't see Jason today, so we're missing him.

514
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,686
What's that? He's running a little late. He's running late.

515
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,810
That's all right. Lauren Johnson.

516
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,400
Good morning, Ms. Johnson. Hi. Good morning.

517
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,438
My name is Lauren Johnson, and I wanted to ask which specific entities

518
00:33:04,534 --> 00:33:08,646
are receiving the $29 million from the Chapter 380

519
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:12,620
agreement and how much each of them are receiving and

520
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,440
how do those get approved? Is it city council that approves those?

521
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,950
Yes, it runs through the Office of Economic Development.

522
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,798
380 agreements are reimbursements for infrastructure work

523
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:30,622
that the City of Houston does not is not

524
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:34,578
responsible for within certain developments. And that 380 goes back towards

525
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:38,098
paying those developments for infrastructure work that should have been taken on by the

526
00:33:38,104 --> 00:33:41,140
City of Houston. I'm sorry.

527
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,326
Go ahead and

528
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:49,894
debt service. So, like yesterday, we went through our Houston Public Works

529
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:53,414
presentation. And in that presentation, you can see there's a dotted line

530
00:33:53,452 --> 00:33:56,746
around 380 that also goes back to paying our debt. So our

531
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:00,106
pay as you go programs and all of our infrastructure programs. So those

532
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:03,450
are all reimbursements. Correct. Okay. Correct.

533
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,366
And many times the developers don't get to a point where we reimburse

534
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:10,746
them a penny. And we have many developers like that, but we reimburse

535
00:34:10,778 --> 00:34:14,766
them over a period of time instead of taking the work at

536
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:19,006
that point in time and spending the monies upfront. So it's

537
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:22,834
actually a pretty good program that works to our advantage. Any other

538
00:34:22,872 --> 00:34:26,066
council member questions, answers on that? Okay, thank you.

539
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:29,246
Ms. Johnson. Ms.

540
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,480
Jill Grochell. Good to see you again this morning.

541
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,118
Appreciate you all being here again. On second day,

542
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,480
actually, third day.

543
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,296
Thank you for the welcome back. Yes, ma'am. Good morning to you all. I will

544
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:49,384
say I'm a little disappointed that you

545
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:53,112
asked the people that gave the budget to walk out

546
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:57,384
yesterday. It was great to be able to speak with them and

547
00:34:57,502 --> 00:35:00,936
let them know how much we like what they do, and we're proud of what

548
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:04,030
they do. And so I'm sad to see them leave.

549
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,796
Yesterday, we heard a community group speak about the needs to address the

550
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:12,076
exposed drainage impacting their community in the north

551
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:16,032
side of Houston, the northeast side of Houston. Excuse me.

552
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:19,490
They were directed. That might be a CIP issue.

553
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,164
What can we do to prioritize these important projects within

554
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:28,580
that department? Thank you for the question. Council member Abby Cayman.

555
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,692
Just as some background, I know I can only speak to our

556
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:36,516
committee, but we had been asked as standard procedure

557
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:40,472
for all. Committees when the directors, after they present,

558
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:44,388
sometimes public comment, can go on for an extended period

559
00:35:44,404 --> 00:35:47,864
of time and they all need to go back to work.

560
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:51,324
So I appreciate what you're saying, I just also

561
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:54,744
want to provide context that it's more so the general rule

562
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:58,700
for all committees, it's not the exception during the budgetary process.

563
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,500
Understood. So to answer your question,

564
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,448
CIP is a roll in three year process.

565
00:36:04,614 --> 00:36:08,610
So every project we had in fiscal year 22

566
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,624
should be completed and rolls off. Generally not the case because we have

567
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:16,416
more projects than available funding. And then 23 rolls

568
00:36:16,448 --> 00:36:20,096
on and then we add on the backside, it'd be fiscal

569
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:23,860
year 27. So we go fiscal year 23 to 27.

570
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,168
So then when we finish the ones on 23, they roll off and we add

571
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:30,516
28 on board. So the tough

572
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:33,784
thing about that is that many of us are on here for

573
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:37,448
just another year and a half and we won't see the work of

574
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,716
our office staff. And what we did

575
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:44,316
in the CIP, that's going to come up long after we are here

576
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:48,012
or we disappear. So it seems

577
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:51,688
to work, but the problem we always have is it's underfunded

578
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:55,136
and we never do all of the projects. That was one of the

579
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:58,960
reasons why about six years ago we put in the council district service fund.

580
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,368
So each of us have an allocation of dollars that we can use towards

581
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:05,504
projects that we think are emergency type projects.

582
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:08,736
And we all do a really good job of identifying the projects

583
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,244
within our area. We firmly believe nobody knows our

584
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:15,604
district better than ourselves because we're in them

585
00:37:15,642 --> 00:37:19,224
every day. And I include the at larges as well. I know I

586
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:23,000
joke around a lot, a little bit tough on you, but you all are always

587
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,584
present at our meetings and always concerned about our

588
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:29,896
area. But CIP is a tough one because it's

589
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:33,724
underfunded and we have too many needs and wants to really fully fund

590
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:37,176
it. But working through council district service funds.

591
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:40,576
And now with the SWAT program, we have extra millions going

592
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:44,096
in that and maybe we'll have a different allocation when

593
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:48,048
we look towards I believe if this budget is based on

594
00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:51,628
no increase on sales tax revenue,

595
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:55,444
I think we're going to have a significant increase in sales tax revenue because

596
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:59,396
it's predicated upon the price of goods today. And everybody who's been

597
00:37:59,418 --> 00:38:02,836
in a grocery store or bought anything knows that the price continues to

598
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:06,756
go up. Thus, unfortunately, our sales tax revenue goes up.

599
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:10,104
So I think we'll have the ability to create more in fund balance and maybe

600
00:38:10,142 --> 00:38:13,160
use some of that fund balance for exactly what we talked about.

601
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,192
Just real quick, do you believe that the Northeast project

602
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:21,288
is an emergency? Could that go into the emergency bucket?

603
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:24,824
So I'll leave that up to council member Jackson to decide what's an emergency

604
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:28,620
in her area not. But I live in Kingwood and

605
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,836
I've been in District B more times than I've been anywhere because it's

606
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:37,056
near my house. I go up there quite often. But I

607
00:38:37,078 --> 00:38:40,716
looked at those photos again this morning. It was concerning.

608
00:38:40,908 --> 00:38:44,720
But then again, my area lost 5000 homes

609
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,952
and 500 businesses due to flooding.

610
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:51,524
And we're trying to make sure that when the next hurricane comes,

611
00:38:51,722 --> 00:38:55,348
we don't get caught in that floodwater again. So we all have those fears.

612
00:38:55,444 --> 00:38:58,536
I'm sure that Council Member Amy Peck will say

613
00:38:58,558 --> 00:39:02,276
the same thing about her district, but Council Member

614
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:06,104
Abby Cayman, especially Myerland and what we've had to do

615
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:09,576
there. When you live at or

616
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:13,096
just a little bit above sea level, you're going to have those types

617
00:39:13,128 --> 00:39:17,116
of situations pop up. And I don't care what you call it,

618
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:20,140
whether you call it global change or global warming,

619
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,916
the tornadoes are coming more rapidly and the hurricanes have more force

620
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:28,204
to them. So we'll see. Council member Tiffany Thomas.

621
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,324
Thank you. And thank you for participating in public comments.

622
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:33,990
Really helpful feedback, but just something to consider.

623
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,452
Imagine who we could be as a city if we actually receive flooding dollars

624
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:42,244
from the Glo, right? Imagine the projects that

625
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:45,760
have been in queue for cycles that are scheduled but not funded.

626
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,896
Imagine who we could be if the federal infrastructure funds were a

627
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:53,450
direct allocation to the city versus an application process.

628
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,076
Because if it had not been for Hurricane Harvey in this region,

629
00:39:57,108 --> 00:40:00,536
those dollars wouldn't be available. Right? And so we are missing

630
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:04,524
out on that. And then working through the federal process to

631
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:08,344
schedule priority projects in any neighborhood. They're all priority.

632
00:40:08,392 --> 00:40:11,864
Right? Let me say, I am one of those people that I lost

633
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:15,184
my home during Harvey and so I get it. But I also know

634
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:18,880
how privileged I am and that we were okay. And I believe

635
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,544
that there were many others that weren't. And that's where my heart

636
00:40:22,582 --> 00:40:26,640
goes. Sure. But here's my point is that we are limited

637
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,208
while also being constrained. We're constrained because we don't

638
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:32,870
have the support, the funding from the state.

639
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,472
We're working through the process federally. And so what we have as a local

640
00:40:37,546 --> 00:40:41,096
city, we're doing the very best and it's not as fast as we

641
00:40:41,118 --> 00:40:44,676
would like. I have at least five unscheduled funded

642
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,784
projects that have been on the books for a while. So I mean, you're absolutely

643
00:40:47,902 --> 00:40:51,224
correct. But just for the public that's listening.

644
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:55,036
The larger issue is that Houston has been missing out and

645
00:40:55,058 --> 00:40:58,316
we have a serious issue around flooding and infrastructure because

646
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:01,948
it's not a matter of if another storm will come, it's when.

647
00:41:02,034 --> 00:41:05,356
And it could rain for 30 minutes in the city and you have two inches

648
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:08,992
of water in your drain, like those storms are that intense. And so we

649
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:12,476
are trying to keep up with that. And then also look at the plans

650
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:15,964
that were designed pre Harvey or right after Harvey.

651
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:19,636
Now looking at our new resiliency standards. Now looking at the new

652
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:22,752
data and city modeling and what does it take in terms of drainage.

653
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:26,004
So there's some work we have to do to make sure that those plans meet

654
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:29,872
those standards, because we don't want to offer your neighborhood or any neighborhood

655
00:41:29,936 --> 00:41:32,776
a project just to say we did a project. We want to make sure that

656
00:41:32,798 --> 00:41:35,896
when we come in and offer a project that you feel safe knowing that those

657
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:39,520
drains work, those streets will clear and that you won't be in a danger

658
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,908
of losing your home. And so we have to continue this process

659
00:41:42,994 --> 00:41:47,176
of raising this issue. And thank you for bringing

660
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:50,360
that information to us and keeping it on our radar. It's very helpful.

661
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,936
Thank you. Council member Tasha Jackson. Thank you,

662
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:57,568
Mayor Pro TEM, and thank you, Council Member Thomas for that.

663
00:41:57,734 --> 00:42:01,068
Also, as Council Member Thomas said, we have SWAT projects,

664
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:04,530
but then also we have to think about the revenue cap.

665
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,644
I'm hearing throughout the whole from yesterday, the issue is

666
00:42:08,762 --> 00:42:12,052
money. Where are we getting the money? And what we're talking about right now is

667
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:15,524
the revenue that the city have, but there is revenue that we could

668
00:42:15,562 --> 00:42:19,130
have that we don't have because of a revenue cap. And so

669
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,268
two caps. Yeah. Even if we just had gotten

670
00:42:23,284 --> 00:42:26,568
rid of the city cap, we would have more resources to do a lot of

671
00:42:26,574 --> 00:42:30,276
these projects. So the flood mitigation projects, we have 14

672
00:42:30,388 --> 00:42:33,932
projects on the book for District B and working

673
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:37,736
with Harris County Flood Control to kind of mitigate some of these projects. So projects

674
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:40,956
are moving forward. It's not moving fast enough. We have some projects

675
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:43,820
on the books from 2011.

676
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,280
These are capital improvement projects. So just know that

677
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,408
we need dollars, and the dollars is out there,

678
00:42:51,494 --> 00:42:55,528
but we just need to identify ways to get it. And removing

679
00:42:55,564 --> 00:42:58,708
that revenue cap is one of the ways that we can get some dollars to

680
00:42:58,714 --> 00:43:02,224
do projects that we definitely need within our neighborhood.

681
00:43:02,272 --> 00:43:06,330
So thank you. Thank you for participating, and thanks again, Ms. Grochell. You're welcome.

682
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,676
I see Mr. Oliver showed up, so if you present your tardy

683
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,896
slip to the principal, we'll allow you. You have

684
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:16,890
your 1 minute. Good to see you again.

685
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,676
Good morning. Yeah, still morning.

686
00:43:23,778 --> 00:43:26,590
Okay. Been here for a while,

687
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,750
so good morning, everyone.

688
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,952
Let's see. So I just came

689
00:43:34,006 --> 00:43:37,356
in and I talked about this a bit yesterday, but I think it falls

690
00:43:37,388 --> 00:43:40,992
specifically under General Services. So the security

691
00:43:41,126 --> 00:43:45,164
right. I tried to use my Harris County enhanced library card

692
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,692
ID to get in, and they told me that I needed either a state

693
00:43:48,746 --> 00:43:52,036
ID or driver's license or passport to get in.

694
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:56,288
Again, this is something we live in Houston. We have quite a

695
00:43:56,314 --> 00:43:59,576
few people who may not have those forms of ID.

696
00:43:59,758 --> 00:44:03,432
So thinking about who is able to come in here and provide public

697
00:44:03,486 --> 00:44:06,904
comment, somebody behind me yesterday had forgotten his

698
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:10,876
license and was having trouble getting in a staffer once a

699
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,804
Council Member Jackson staffers had to come down and vouch for him.

700
00:44:13,842 --> 00:44:17,612
Right. So we really

701
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:21,090
need to kind of make sure that this is more accessible in that way.

702
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,516
I forgot my other thing. Capital improvement

703
00:44:25,548 --> 00:44:28,944
projects. I just think translation is a

704
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:32,684
big deal, especially for city documents, thinking about how can we improve

705
00:44:32,732 --> 00:44:35,908
the infrastructure on budgetary documents and

706
00:44:35,914 --> 00:44:39,428
then capital improvement documents, because these affect the entire city.

707
00:44:39,514 --> 00:44:42,340
So I just want to make sure and kind of urge that as well.

708
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:45,556
Sure. Council member Robert Gallegos. Thank you,

709
00:44:45,578 --> 00:44:49,464
Chair. Thank you for that explanation. When you were saying

710
00:44:49,502 --> 00:44:53,432
that you tried to get in with the new Harris County ID,

711
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:57,544
they didn't accept it. No, I tried it yesterday on the first

712
00:44:57,582 --> 00:45:01,096
floor and then today in the basement. I'm glad

713
00:45:01,128 --> 00:45:04,472
you brought that to my attention because I've met with Mayor Turner

714
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:08,156
to see if we will accept the

715
00:45:08,178 --> 00:45:11,984
new Harris County ID. And I think that would be a great,

716
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:14,000
great asset, hopefully.

717
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,400
Can you tell me if that ID has a chip on it?

718
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,432
I don't think it has a chip. Yeah, it just has

719
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,924
the card and then photo address

720
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:29,428
and then gender and right. Because I know the

721
00:45:29,434 --> 00:45:33,376
sheriff's department accepts it. I know Mayor Turner is looking at HPD

722
00:45:33,408 --> 00:45:36,820
to see if HPD will accept it. And I'm hoping

723
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,068
that this is something that can be used for metro,

724
00:45:40,244 --> 00:45:43,240
something that can be used for the B cycle stations.

725
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,988
Basically a universal Harris County ID that Harris

726
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:51,980
County residents can use. So thank you for bringing that to my attention.

727
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,820
I'm hoping the mayor's administration is listening to this as well.

728
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:59,176
Thank you. Thank you. Council Member Abby Cayman I also

729
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:03,084
wanted to echo my appreciation for flagging the issue and Council Member Gallegos

730
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:07,824
for the update and taking the charge, especially given

731
00:46:07,942 --> 00:46:12,400
the implementation of the state's photo ID laws,

732
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,884
the additional hurdles that go into place right. That make it that much

733
00:46:16,922 --> 00:46:20,212
harder for an average person to get that state

734
00:46:20,266 --> 00:46:23,924
issued driver's license or photo ID will be

735
00:46:23,962 --> 00:46:27,524
critical to make sure that we're being as inclusive as possible within the parameters

736
00:46:27,572 --> 00:46:30,664
of security and safety that we have to provide at the city.

737
00:46:30,782 --> 00:46:34,660
Right. Thank you. Council member Robert Gallegos.

738
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,548
Thank you, council Member Kayman. Yes. This is an ID that I think can be

739
00:46:38,574 --> 00:46:42,430
used for homeless individuals that need an ID

740
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,964
for individuals that are coming out of jail that

741
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:49,276
don't have an ID. So that way, hopefully, they can find a job and

742
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:52,812
what have you. So this is something that I'm hoping

743
00:46:52,956 --> 00:46:56,384
we can work with the Harris County and have it as a

744
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:59,936
universal ID for Harris County residents or who lose them

745
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:03,308
in floods that are so rare in Houston and Harris

746
00:47:03,324 --> 00:47:07,184
County. Right, right. Thank you, Ronnie. On that

747
00:47:07,222 --> 00:47:11,596
note, this concludes our General Service Department budget

748
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:15,044
workshop. We will now transition to to Parks

749
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:18,516
and Recreation. I see those folks are here so we'll

750
00:47:18,548 --> 00:47:21,816
allow a couple of minute transition and we'll get right

751
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,000
into it a little bit early, which we couldn't say at all yesterday.
