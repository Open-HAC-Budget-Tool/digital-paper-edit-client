1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,866
Department workshop. We will now adjourn the Housing Department budget

2
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:07,498
workshop and begin our budget workshop for the Houston Public Library.

3
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:08,800
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,200
Oh,

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,950
hello. Are you ready?

6
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,784
Yes, ma'am. At this time, I would like to welcome Director RIA Brown Lawson

7
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:11,184
and hope to

8
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:14,320
provide the Houston Public Library budget presentation.

9
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,000
The floor is yours. Thank you. And hello,

10
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,188
everybody. Thank you for the opportunity to present

11
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:27,190
the Houston Public Library's proposed budget for fiscal year 2023.

12
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,110
Before I begin, I'd like to take advantage of this opportunity

13
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,640
to publicly thank and acknowledge the members of the Houston Public

14
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,610
Library Executive Leadership Team and

15
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,770
other staff who are responsible for

16
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,788
helping the library to be one of

17
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:51,576
the best library systems in the country. So I'd

18
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:55,116
like to publicly thank and acknowledge all those members of the

19
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:58,504
executive team. It is my honor and privilege

20
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,856
to work with a team of professionals with such an

21
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:05,612
array of talent, innovativeness creativity, and deep commitment

22
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:09,730
to provide equitable services to the residents of our great city.

23
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,576
I would also like to thank and acknowledge the Houston Public Library Foundation

24
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,452
for their unwavering support of the library and their

25
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:22,484
support of the library's programs. Joining me

26
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:27,040
today for the presentation is the Library Department's chief

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,500
Financial officer and Assistant Director Hope Wabakesee.

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,428
With that, I will now present our proposed FY.

29
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:39,164
And if you would come a little closer to the microphone. Absolutely.

30
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:40,940
Is that better? Yes, ma'am.

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,864
Okay. Slide two presents the library's functional

32
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:52,160
organizational chart. The chart shows the distribution

33
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,628
of the proposed FY 23 budget and FTEs

34
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:00,720
within the six divisions of the library.

35
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,160
Next slide.

36
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,032
Slide three outlines departmental

37
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:13,590
programming and considerations relative to major services,

38
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,040
statutory requirements, and the financial impact

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,344
on service delivery regarding services and

40
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:26,476
programs. The library remains committed to the delivery of

41
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:30,152
equitable quality services and resources in multiple

42
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:33,756
formats to all residents of Houston through

43
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:37,288
the department's network of 38 libraries embedded

44
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:40,992
in neighborhoods throughout the city, the mobile lab

45
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:44,780
and three history research collections

46
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,720
and the Central Library.

47
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,200
Next slide.

48
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,324
I'm sorry. Same slide. Also in high

49
00:03:56,362 --> 00:04:00,816
demand are resources for small businesses, new entrepreneurs

50
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:04,772
and job seekers. The library's network of 38 locations

51
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:09,044
throughout the city also service critical community hubs, which include

52
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:12,568
two technic facilities, three history research

53
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:16,308
centers of Texas history, african American

54
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:21,292
history and genealogical resources, with over 193

55
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:24,952
print volumes, 2500 archival

56
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:28,900
and or history collections, and 320 microform

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,480
resources per state

58
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,960
law. In terms of statutory requirements

59
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,892
per the state law, the Texas

60
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:44,752
State Library and Archives Commission, or Tslac,

61
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:48,724
sets the standards and requirements for the accreditation of

62
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:52,640
libraries throughout the state. State accreditation

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,224
eligibility requires a per capita

64
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:59,960
of 17 dollarsfifty, cents and

65
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,576
at least one item of library materials per

66
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,936
capita. The libraries per capita

67
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:10,540
for the state FY 21 annual report

68
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,044
was 16.90. To fill

69
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:18,484
the gap, HPL submitted supplemental

70
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:22,416
maintenance and security dollars from GST for the

71
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:26,012
last two years as part of the support for library

72
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,340
operations to help meet the Tslac

73
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,676
accreditation requirements. With the

74
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:36,928
budget increase this year, we should be poised to meet state accreditation

75
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:40,900
standards during the next reporting period.

76
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,728
Financial or societal impact of the City service

77
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:51,512
delivery includes 1.4

78
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:55,556
million cardholders have access to 3 million print

79
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:59,052
and digital resources. In a world where

80
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:02,936
having technological access is a basic necessity,

81
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:06,716
the library is the largest provider of free Internet access

82
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:10,604
in the region. Through their neighborhood libraries,

83
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:13,612
Houston residents have access to WiFi,

84
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:17,040
hotspots, tablets and computers.

85
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,040
According to the Texas State Library, for every

86
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,464
one dollars invested in public libraries

87
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:27,572
in Texas, the community sees a return

88
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:29,910
of approximately $5.

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,020
Anticipated growth or reduction of population

90
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,608
served in FY 23.8 million

91
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:43,690
people utilize the library in person or via the website.

92
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,300
With Houston's growth in current user demand requiring more

93
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,920
robust Eservices and programs, we have seen marked

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,150
increase in digital services, which is up currently.

95
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,364
28% from FY 2020 database

96
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:05,330
use increased 41% last year,

97
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,292
especially the use of Linda.com, where users

98
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:12,644
access instructive videos to

99
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,352
build creativity and business skills to achieve

100
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,612
personal and professional goals. This increased demand is

101
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,996
particularly impactful to the department's budget,

102
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:28,120
as databases and electronic resources are

103
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,640
very much more costly than print materials.

104
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,052
Slide Four this

105
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:41,112
slide provides an overview of the department's revenues from FY

106
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:45,080
21 actual to FY 23 anticipated

107
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,376
revenues. The library is not a revenue

108
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:52,336
generating department, but it does contribute to the

109
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:56,450
General Fund through passport Services and the

110
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,080
central library parking garage.

111
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,264
The Historic Preservation Fund generates revenue for the Julia Addison

112
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:09,280
Building, which is used to support the special maintenance

113
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,390
that is required for this historic building.

114
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,696
The special revenue fund is associated with the

115
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:19,640
Mayor's Office for Adult Literacy.

116
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,640
Next slide.

117
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,580
Slide five provides revenue highlights.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,512
We anticipate returning to pre pandemic operations

119
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:37,356
in FY 23, which will contribute to an increase in

120
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:41,040
the revenue generated from the Passport services fees.

121
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,704
The increase in facility rental fees is

122
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:48,364
mainly due to the Frenchies restaurant rental for Smith

123
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:51,936
Library parking. The grant transfer

124
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:56,464
is a onetime FEMA insurance allocation to reimburse

125
00:08:56,592 --> 00:09:00,404
Kendall library books and materials that were lost due to

126
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:01,860
Hurricane Harvey.

127
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,716
Next slide the library's

128
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:11,736
expenditures for FY 23 reflect an increase of

129
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:14,952
13.7% based on

130
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:18,328
mandatory salary and benefit increases

131
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:21,660
and an increase in the books and materials budget.

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,164
The Historic Preservation Fund expenditures do

133
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:28,440
not affect the General Fund as rental revenues

134
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,028
cover expenditures for improvement in historical maintenance

135
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:34,130
of the Julia Odds building.

136
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,320
Next slide.

137
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,052
Slide seven outlines the FY 2023

138
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:45,572
expenditure highlights. For personnel services,

139
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:50,048
there was a 3% hope increase fringe benefit increase

140
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:53,860
minimum wage increase, an additional 29

141
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,220
positions for staff two staff,

142
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,072
two new library buildings, a leaf and Dr.

143
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:04,120
Shannon Walker and the Kendall Renovated library.

144
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,264
FY 23 will be the first time in several

145
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:12,140
years that we will have all HPL locations open

146
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,700
and fully operational, requiring an increase in staffing.

147
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,592
The increase in supplies and services will be used

148
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:24,576
in the libraries just mentioned. The budget also

149
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:28,320
reflects an increase in the restricted accounts.

150
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,224
The 1.7 million increase in books and materials

151
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:36,164
relates back to the one time FEMA insurance allocation that

152
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,008
covers Kindle library books and materials,

153
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:42,436
an improved increase of 1 million that would allow

154
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:46,308
HPL to meet the Texas State Library accreditation

155
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:49,560
standards. Next slide.

156
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,320
The primary drivers in library expenses are

157
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,364
personnel and materials. Personnel expenses

158
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:03,432
for the library represents 72% of our total budget,

159
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:07,756
and the nonpersonal budget is 28% of

160
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:11,964
the nonpersonal budget. Non capital books and materials represent

161
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:14,924
46%, restricted accounts,

162
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:19,360
25%. Services represent 22%,

163
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,110
and supplies represent 2%.

164
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,300
Next slide.

165
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,852
Slide nine shows our operating budget of

166
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:35,480
30.4 million, with restricted accounts totaling

167
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,716
13.6 million. The contracted

168
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:43,290
and mandated adjustments total 1.5 million.

169
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:51,950
Our proposed FY 23 budget is 50,000,000.342,

170
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,110
which reflects a change of 14.1%.

171
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,544
Next slide. The chart on

172
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:06,192
slide ten represents the library's history of being good

173
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:10,000
stewards of the allocated funds the department receives.

174
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,574
Next slide. This concludes

175
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:21,194
my formal presentation, and I'd like to point out that the

176
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:25,154
appendix contains the library's workplace

177
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:28,330
analysis, including staff numbers and demographic

178
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,802
information, departmental accomplishments for FY

179
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:35,530
22, and restricted account details.

180
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,960
I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.

181
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,806
Thank you, Director, for your presentation. We will now take questions from council

182
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:47,326
members who will each receive two minutes per the normal committee rules.

183
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:50,510
First in the queue is vice mayor pro TEM martha castex tate.

184
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,290
Director Lawson, thank you for your presentation. You know, I love the library

185
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,382
and all that you all stand for, and all that we do in the city

186
00:12:57,436 --> 00:13:00,338
of Houston, especially around adult literacy.

187
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:03,754
Super excited about the Dr. Shannon Walker Library coming

188
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:08,294
to District K soon. Based on your stat

189
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:12,090
on page three, we should see a big return in

190
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,580
societal impact in District K

191
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,598
with the new library coming on board. But my question

192
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:23,450
is, can you talk a little bit about the revenues

193
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,006
from the passport services as we look at our

194
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:30,606
budget and how we can increase revenues in the city? I was intrigued

195
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:34,462
at our meeting that we have four or five passport

196
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:37,986
offices in libraries. I'd be

197
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:41,480
happy to pre pandemic. We were

198
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,594
providing million dollars worth of passport

199
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:50,658
services through the city, through five locations. Five locations?

200
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:54,730
Yes, and we anticipate

201
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,698
they're very popular. Let me just say we're better than the

202
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,922
post office. You can quote me on that. And we have

203
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:06,506
many people complimenting

204
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:10,334
our staff on the process, so they like to use the

205
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:14,106
library, and during our discussion council

206
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:18,306
Member you're wondering why we don't do it in more locations and

207
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:23,214
generate more money. And our conversation accounted

208
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,562
with. Well, if we do more locations, maybe the library can keep

209
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,982
half and the city can get half. So a million

210
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:32,550
apiece. We'll do ten locations.

211
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,200
Okay.

212
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,090
Would you need additional staff? If we put five more passport

213
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,722
offices in five libraries, will we need additional

214
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:48,346
staff, or would staff be able to cover that, will we be able to

215
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:52,470
see a bigger gain, or would we need to actually hire

216
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,346
additional staff for that running of five additional passport

217
00:14:56,378 --> 00:15:01,146
offices? I think we would definitely need more staff.

218
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:05,486
We did five more locations. We'd need at

219
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:09,282
least five more staff members, but they would pay for themselves with

220
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:12,514
a million dollar five

221
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:17,380
passport offices. We've generated a million dollars through

222
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,580
the revenues we have.

223
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,198
Okay. And that money went back to the general fund and not to the

224
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:27,478
library. Every cent went back to the

225
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:31,442
general fund. Okay. Council Member Robinson.

226
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:34,726
Thank you. Chair and Director, thank you so much for all you

227
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:37,794
do with such limited number of staff.

228
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:41,594
It's really, truly remarkable. So I want to thank your team personally for that.

229
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:44,666
And of course, you and I are also working on what we hope will be

230
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:48,986
a map archive for the Julietison Library downtown.

231
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:52,846
So referring to that same chart of revenues that

232
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,614
the Vice Mayor Pro TEM referred to on page four,

233
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:59,634
that category of special revenue fund, while we're talking about

234
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:03,426
it and thinking in particular about the Julia Idison I know

235
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:08,142
it's come to my attention that that is the number one venue

236
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:11,678
in what, the city for weddings.

237
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:15,046
Help me with this director. We are rated on

238
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:18,674
a national scale of being the top ten places

239
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:21,990
for holding weddings. Yes. Okay,

240
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,318
so that's top ten in the United States of America.

241
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:28,970
Absolutely. Okay, so while we're talking about passports,

242
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,570
let's talk about people getting married at libraries. I love that.

243
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,542
Let's do that. Just for the record, I am a single

244
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:42,750
man, but I know that's beside the point. We'll hold a spot.

245
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,470
How much money you got? Says the vice member.

246
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,954
Yeah. Another aside, but it

247
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:54,030
does raise the question about potential

248
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,806
revenue sources for our beautiful facilities. Because whether it's

249
00:16:57,838 --> 00:17:01,206
the new library that's going into District K, whether it's the

250
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:05,000
incredible facility that's going into District F on the West Side,

251
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,886
our flagship libraries that

252
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:12,374
are downtown and the ones that we know are most used

253
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:16,602
whether those funds go back into the general revenue fund or

254
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:20,074
how else we categorize those revenues, I'd be

255
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:23,514
really interested, because it strikes me that what we

256
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:27,322
do, as Vice Mayor Pro TEM pointed out, for societal

257
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:31,680
impacts, that is really something that

258
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,386
you'd think could fuel some staffing and fuel

259
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:38,862
some activities throughout the city. If you cared to comment,

260
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:42,174
we'd love to hear from you. Sure. And we're

261
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:45,742
really excited about all our historical buildings,

262
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:49,378
and with the right amount of staff and

263
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:53,862
promotion, we assure that we could generate even

264
00:17:53,916 --> 00:18:00,098
more activity around them. But you're

265
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:03,754
only able to do that based on your capacity to do

266
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,338
it. And so you would need, like, any other

267
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,940
venue staffing around that.

268
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,970
That would be the answer. Capacity is everything,

269
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,398
right? And again, with the great resignation chair, that's going to be a

270
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:23,726
challenge for this department. Like every other one we've heard from today, but thank

271
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:27,578
you, director. You're welcome. Council member came in. Thank you,

272
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:31,294
Dr. Lawson. First off, we love our libraries.

273
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:33,380
Thank you to the entire team.

274
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,862
Can you say it one more time? When it came to Internet,

275
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,510
as a provider of Internet accessibility,

276
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,370
did you say that our libraries are the largest provider

277
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,270
in the region? In the region, yes.

278
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,142
And given the digital

279
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:56,506
divide that we saw during the

280
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:59,866
Pandemic, especially with students and youth that did

281
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,850
not have access to Internet, I'm assuming that those programs are continuing

282
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,670
beyond the Pandemic. Oh, yes. What we did during the Pandemic

283
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,914
was to install high powered antennas

284
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:18,354
on several of our locations so that those

285
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:21,730
families that did not have Internet access

286
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,190
could, at least from our parking lots with libraries closed,

287
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,034
have that kind of access. And some of them

288
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:33,350
were strong enough to bleeding to the homes that were nearby.

289
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,538
But broadband is a national

290
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,894
issue, as we all know, and having access

291
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:45,850
to the Internet is now like having

292
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,594
electricity in your home. It's a necessity because

293
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:53,686
if you don't have it, you are cut off from a lot of information that's

294
00:19:53,718 --> 00:19:57,690
needed. We see people using libraries to apply

295
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,482
for jobs to hold. They rent out spaces

296
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:05,354
so that they can hold job interviews, because most job interviews

297
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:09,380
now are online. We see

298
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,626
number of citizens borrowing hotspots so

299
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:18,654
that they can take that hotspot into their home and have Internet

300
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:21,942
access. All that we're doing,

301
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:25,446
and we're doing a lot, it's a drop in the bucket for

302
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:29,110
the whole conversation around broadband and its necessity.

303
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,960
Maybe place back in queue. Go ahead. Thank you,

304
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,782
and I appreciate that. And all the efforts to confirm

305
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:41,434
all of the libraries are now back up and running that were

306
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:44,634
prior to the Pandemic. So they're open for all.

307
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:48,702
And I'm asking because we're coming up on Summer, where our libraries again

308
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:52,974
play that really important role out of school to

309
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:56,894
keep children sharp during

310
00:20:56,932 --> 00:21:00,766
the summer. They engage in summer reading.

311
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,402
And yes, our libraries will be open for those

312
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:08,850
activities to keep their minds active

313
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,862
through having fun. Through reading and having fun

314
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:18,230
and library programs during the summer because

315
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,798
there is national research

316
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:25,802
that shows that kids that are not engaged during the summer do

317
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:29,114
lose as much as a grade level and it

318
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:33,498
provides a safe place for them to be sometimes. The last

319
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,530
two other questions I had really quickly. One, do all of our libraries

320
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,406
provide printing and scanning services currently for

321
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:44,874
the public? Scanning, like scanning

322
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:48,074
digital paper copies that they may need to be scanned,

323
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:51,954
but also printing services? I'm not

324
00:21:51,992 --> 00:21:55,602
sure if all of them do, a number of them

325
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:58,994
do. I can get that answer to you. I would just

326
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:02,258
be interested in the cost breakdown of what that is. I know I've

327
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:06,006
been looking in the district if there's something that needs to be supplemented out of

328
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,150
district service funds for printing,

329
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,120
oftentimes, again,

330
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,874
for those that may not be able to afford it. Right. Those people that are

331
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:18,538
trying to apply for a job and may need just those few extra dollars,

332
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,660
those types of needs. I'm just trying to explore that.

333
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,798
Printing is everywhere. Scanning. That's what

334
00:22:25,824 --> 00:22:29,402
I'd have to check on. Okay, I would appreciate that. And lastly,

335
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:33,440
due to the financial constraints that the city continues to face

336
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,142
throughout every single department, what are the needs

337
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:42,338
that you foresee for the most immediate and long term future that

338
00:22:42,424 --> 00:22:45,806
we are not able to meet right now that you want us to be focused

339
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:49,410
on? What I'd like to

340
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,550
say as a reply to that question

341
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,202
to all council members is to appreciate

342
00:22:57,266 --> 00:23:00,518
what the Houston Public Library is able to provide

343
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:04,266
for our citizens. But when you look at

344
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:06,730
our bottom line budget,

345
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,734
our bottom line budget, even with the increase

346
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:15,698
this year, is a far cry for even Chicago's

347
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:20,142
Public Library. That serves 4.6

348
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:28,560
million people with a budget of 100,000,003.

349
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,938
And our budget is at 50 million.

350
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:34,420
So you can see the difference.

351
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,974
So that would be it. The more money we have in our budget,

352
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:42,280
the more we can continue to provide services.

353
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,906
We staff our facilities at the bare minimum,

354
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:50,134
except for those that are the busiest. And I

355
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:54,014
think that's where the community is being shortchanged.

356
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:58,314
Because we had more robust staff, we certainly could

357
00:23:58,352 --> 00:23:59,660
provide more services.

358
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,014
Thank you for that presentation and those answers. We'll now move

359
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:11,822
into the public comment period. The first public

360
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:14,270
speaker will be Mr. Jason Oliver.

361
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,990
Hi. I love the library.

362
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,020
I really appreciate everything that you all do.

363
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,360
I just want to start off saying that. Thank you. Thank you so much.

364
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,262
First. I know. The Harris County Library system

365
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:39,862
has rolled out the enhanced ID program this year. I actually

366
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:43,334
tried to use mine to come in. I don't know why

367
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:46,858
we need an ID to come into this building, but I tried to use it

368
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:50,326
and wasn't allowed. So I hope that that can change, because that's

369
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:54,582
a really important program. But I wanted to ask if HPL

370
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,686
is planning to join that and what will be needed for HPL to be able

371
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:01,200
to do that. So that's my first question.

372
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,822
And then second, it's often hard to find books by local

373
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:08,946
authors in the library's collections. How could we create a

374
00:25:08,968 --> 00:25:12,338
program or initiative focused on acquiring the works of

375
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:16,130
local authors? So, first, that enhanced ID program, and then second,

376
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,140
local author acquisitions and wrapping those up?

377
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,040
Thank you for those questions.

378
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,526
In terms of enhanced ID, that's something that we can certainly

379
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:31,250
look into. We haven't had that as a priority

380
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,194
for the library system. We've had other priorities, but we certainly can

381
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,340
look into that and update you on that research.

382
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,566
And your second question was about local author acquisitions

383
00:25:44,598 --> 00:25:47,982
and how we might be able to create, just acquire more works

384
00:25:48,036 --> 00:25:53,514
by local authors. We are increasingly

385
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:57,862
focused on building our local author collection.

386
00:25:58,026 --> 00:26:01,950
We have an ongoing local author display.

387
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,454
We have local author programs inviting

388
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:09,882
local authors to come and even participate

389
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:13,474
in workshops when experienced

390
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:17,446
local authors will give advice to those authors that

391
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:21,718
are trying to start publishing and

392
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:25,306
how to get started. So we are focused on it.

393
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:29,258
We probably need to do more promotion about that,

394
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:33,274
but we are very embracing of

395
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:36,560
local authors. Okay.

396
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,542
I just find it hard to find their books in the libraries and especially

397
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:44,270
in the digital collections.

398
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,494
Author is not a part of the permanent

399
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,660
library collection. Right,

400
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,754
and I can explain more about that. I'd be

401
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,980
happy to. Okay, thank you.

402
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,110
Stop up landing.

403
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,448
I just want a second appreciation for

404
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:14,592
the library. We love it. It's such a nourishing space

405
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:17,828
for the community and I love it so much. I brought my daughter and

406
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:20,950
I'm trying to talk her into speaking and asking you a question,

407
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,172
but for my time I have a question for you based

408
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:29,204
on your metrics. The library has a huge impact on Houstonians.

409
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:31,640
I know our family has felt that personally,

410
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,648
I'm curious what we know about whether library access or specific

411
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:41,256
services are equitably and how they're equitably

412
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:45,084
distributed across the city. Thank you for that

413
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:49,020
question. Our one Houston one library

414
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,616
master plan is based on that one word

415
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,324
equity. And we're looking many of the council

416
00:27:57,372 --> 00:28:01,392
members have participated in seeing

417
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:05,250
that presentation of our master plan.

418
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,700
But it involves seven regions

419
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,020
and in those seven regions what we plan to do is

420
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,344
have similar services, if not the

421
00:28:17,402 --> 00:28:20,712
exact services, similar services in each

422
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:24,968
of those regions so that people don't have to go from

423
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:28,888
one community to another unless they just want to.

424
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:32,684
But that's what we're striving to be a

425
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:36,604
city of equitable library services across the city.

426
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:39,790
I appreciate that and I love that idea. Thank you.

427
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,220
Geogrosal,

428
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,104
hi. First I want to say same thing about the library.

429
00:28:54,152 --> 00:28:57,836
Actually, my number one thing I use most on my phone is my

430
00:28:57,858 --> 00:29:01,824
Libby app. I love that app. It gets the most use

431
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:05,376
of everything that I use and I appreciate it. And especially since

432
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:08,784
the library has been closed, to be able to use that has been

433
00:29:08,902 --> 00:29:12,532
phenomenal. So thank you. Thank you. And I also

434
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:15,764
tell everyone about it. I wanted

435
00:29:15,802 --> 00:29:19,316
to ask you, are there any programs that the library I'm going to invite you

436
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:22,260
to do an ad for the library.

437
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,050
Somebody's going to come up to you and get that because we're looking to

438
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,096
have more user comments on our

439
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:34,804
library and if you found something that's really useful, I appreciate

440
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:38,376
that. I would love to do that for you. Tell me where and

441
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:40,910
when somebody approach you. Okay.

442
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,532
Are there any programs that the library is interested in implementing or

443
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:49,372
seeking to implement for which it doesn't currently have the necessary

444
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:50,240
funding?

445
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,010
How long a time do you have?

446
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,364
We always want to do more. We think we've hit a

447
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:06,756
good balance with understanding what the citizens of

448
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:11,030
our city want and need. We just like to do more of it.

449
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,412
Longer. That would require longer hours, more weekend

450
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:18,952
services, more access to the library. Okay,

451
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:22,810
well, let me know how I can help. All right. Somebody approach you?

452
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,124
Roderick Butler. We're getting Sunday coming

453
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:30,990
soon. Didn't say that,

454
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,544
Director. I stand with all

455
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:42,812
of these people that we would be wherever,

456
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:46,690
do whatever, because thank you.

457
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,524
You are a treasure. Libraries provide a

458
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:55,270
safety net for communities, for our children,

459
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,284
for our adults, and they are

460
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:02,500
there in our good, our bad, and sometimes they're just there,

461
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,784
and that's all it requires. But I would like to

462
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,684
ask you about my community. There is a little library

463
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:13,384
called Scenic Wood Regional Library. We would love this

464
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:17,768
may be a CIP issue to expand the footprint of that library.

465
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:21,384
Basically, the capacity. It has land to the north

466
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:25,224
of it vacant. It has land to the south of it. It's forest,

467
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:28,304
but it's still vacant. There are other libraries like

468
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:32,144
Dixon Library, which is new. We would love to expand the footprint of that.

469
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:35,650
I don't even know if Lakewood Library has come back online,

470
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,208
but we need to know,

471
00:31:40,374 --> 00:31:43,540
do you have any plans for new libraries in the future

472
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,220
in your master plan? How do we get it? How do we support you,

473
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,364
and how do we give input for it? We would

474
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:55,608
love to have your input with

475
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:59,572
our planning for library

476
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:02,904
spaces and understand better what the

477
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:06,430
needs are. We have a good sense. We know that

478
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,830
there are communities that need more.

479
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,512
We do understand that. What I answered

480
00:32:15,656 --> 00:32:19,164
about services is all about capacity.

481
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:23,232
It's about our CIP. It's about having

482
00:32:23,286 --> 00:32:27,056
enough funding to go around. And I meant what

483
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,740
I said about equity. We're looking at each area of the city

484
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,116
and seeing how we can be a

485
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:38,630
more equitable department in terms of

486
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,192
providing services, if not

487
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:45,690
right away, a larger footprint, at least the services

488
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,584
in those areas. Well, my heart is full and know

489
00:32:50,622 --> 00:32:54,324
that this is your army. Yes, it is. So you just call upon

490
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,564
us, all right? Because we've all been

491
00:32:57,682 --> 00:33:01,052
in a library, and it has

492
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:04,508
benefited us. So please know that. Thank you so much.

493
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:05,390
Thank you.

494
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,816
Vice Mayor Pro TEM Cassex Taylor. Thank you. I want to

495
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:13,676
close with this comment. Director Lawson.

496
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:17,344
When we were looking to build our library in District A, we had an

497
00:33:17,382 --> 00:33:21,540
opportunity to take a tour of some libraries throughout the city

498
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,508
hosted by your staff, and we've had

499
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:29,620
quite a few residents from District B to

500
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,744
talk about their concerns. But I will tell you,

501
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:37,028
this is one area where I can tell you firsthand

502
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:40,792
that District B is shining bright, because we

503
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:44,504
got to visit the library and saw the tech link and

504
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:48,024
all the technology in the library in District

505
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:52,270
B. And I will tell you, I was like, I want all that

506
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,652
in our new library in District K too. So I hear

507
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:59,920
you when you talk about equity and you talk about making

508
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,232
sure that our communities that

509
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:09,532
have found themselves many times to be maybe

510
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:13,552
not having the same level of resources that the library

511
00:34:13,696 --> 00:34:17,444
has walked the walk. And the resources that are available

512
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:21,104
in the libraries in District B were phenomenal

513
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:24,952
when we were there on the tour. So thank you for caring about

514
00:34:25,006 --> 00:34:28,248
the citizens of Houston and making sure that we

515
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:31,764
all have access to great quality libraries

516
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:35,032
throughout the city of Houston. We appreciate all that you do.

517
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:38,492
This is probably the happiest budget amendment I mean,

518
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:42,204
budget session of all of the ones that we'll hear over this

519
00:34:42,242 --> 00:34:46,460
week. So we appreciate all the work that you do. Did you say amendment?

520
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,600
I have amendment on my mind because I'm thinking about those passports.

521
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,496
Thank you. I really appreciate all the support that all of

522
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:58,800
you give to the library.

523
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,150
Daughter Blending, did you want to sign up to speak?

524
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:24,758
I like the audiobooks that the libraries provide,

525
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:28,134
and I want more of those for

526
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:29,350
the libraries.

527
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,410
We hear you. Which library is your library?

528
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,496
Stonica Library. All right.

529
00:35:44,678 --> 00:35:46,480
More audiobooks.

530
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,380
We'll try to accommodate your request.

531
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,830
Thank you.

532
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,636
Council member Cayman. Council member Cayman. Miss Blanding,

533
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:05,208
I just wanted to say you did a really good job. You're probably one of

534
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:08,468
the youngest people we've ever had speak at Budget,

535
00:36:08,564 --> 00:36:09,770
and you were awesome.

536
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,480
And thank you for speaking up about audiobooks. We were debating

537
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,592
that, I think, a few council sessions ago about the importance

538
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:25,170
of audiobooks. So really, thank you for making such a difference.

539
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,200
Thank you for your presentation. There are no additional in person

540
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,992
or virtual speakers before we

541
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:38,560
wrap up. Really say thank you not only to the director, but your entire

542
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,144
staff, the entire team, all of you, all who work within the library

543
00:36:42,192 --> 00:36:45,744
department. We understand that budgets are tight,

544
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:49,284
and you all make the best of what you can with the resources that you

545
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:52,644
have. There are people all over the city who truly

546
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:55,816
value, and the contributions you make to us

547
00:36:55,918 --> 00:36:59,624
are greatly appreciated. I think I heard you by saying there are 1.4

548
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:03,480
million cardholders. Yes. That's incredible.

549
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,816
We're rolling up on 2 million. So that's incredible. So thank

550
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:10,964
you all for everything that you do. Before we adjourn,

551
00:37:11,012 --> 00:37:14,320
please note that the budget workshops will continue to tomorrow,

552
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,496
Tuesday, May 17, at 10:00 A.m., with general services.

553
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:21,824
Reminder to all council members to be checking SharePoint for

554
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:25,360
uploaded presentations as well as responses for any questions

555
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:29,196
submitted. Thank you again to everyone for being here today, and this meeting

556
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:30,240
is adjourned.

557
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,670
Thank you.
