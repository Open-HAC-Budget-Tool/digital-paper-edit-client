1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,680
Speakers. And we will now be

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,046
going to the City Council. Yeah, one of

3
00:00:08,068 --> 00:00:12,190
the, I would say being biased, one of the best departments.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,346
So at this time, I want to welcome Ms. Bernita Jones

5
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:20,602

6

7
00:00:24,132 --> 00:00:27,190

So thank you all for being here. Look forward to your presentation.

00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,020

That's a R.

13
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,050
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.

14
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,484
My name is Bernita Jones. I'm assistant director for

15
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:50,196
Houston City Council. And today I will be presenting the

16
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:54,004
FY 23 projected budget for City Council. But before

17
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:57,190
I start, I would like to introduce my staff to you.

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,444
On my right I have Mary Hamilton. He does the financial analyst

19
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:05,192
for City Council. And if my new staff will please stand,

20
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:08,824
I would like to acknowledge them. These are the individuals that

21
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,072
take care of city council every day. They make sure that

22
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:15,324
all of their needs are met. They work really hard and they

23
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:18,396
always have a smile on their face regardless of what's going on. And I would

24
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:21,150
just like to thank them. I appreciate each one of them.

25
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,170
Next slide, please.

26
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,330
Right here are 16 council members

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,832
that are overlooking the beautiful city of Houston,

28
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:40,304
Texas. And I would like to acknowledge

29
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:43,920
the council members because every Tuesday

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,220
constituents come in and they just

31
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,872
hammer the mayor and the council member. And I would like to say that these

32
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:54,436
City council member works very hard. They work hard and they're

33
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:57,908
diligently looking after the city. They have CIP

34
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:01,544
meetings, they have civic club meetings that they attend. They have

35
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:05,116
town hall meetings. And they do a great job in making sure that the

36
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:08,776
City of Houston is the best that it can be. And I thank each council

37
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:12,284
member for the hard work that you do. Thank you. Next slide,

38
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:15,520
please. Okay,

39
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,068
now this is the organizational chart for the City of Houston.

40
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:23,024
And in FY 22 we

41
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:26,916
had approximately 78.4 I

42
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:29,940
can't see the screen 78.4 FTEs.

43
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,612
In FY 23, we're proposing to have

44
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,400
79.5 FTEs.

45
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,056
And as you can see, the budget for FY 23 is proposed to

46
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:47,592
be $13,985,308

47
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:51,204
for City Council as a whole. The budget

48
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:54,876
as you go down, you will see, will be split between 16 council members and

49
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:55,804
that would be $491,115.

50
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:59,772
A little

51
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:06,544
further, you go down and you see city council general. That's $627,466

52
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:10,336
which is allocated for the health funds and the health insurance

53
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,384
for city council members and their staff. The last allocation

54
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:18,948
is for council district service funds. That's $5,500,000.

55
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:20,230
Next slide, please.

56
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,574
Next. We have the gender and the ethnicity, the demographics

57
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:31,918
for City Council. There are 53 females

58
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:35,326
and 26 males that's working with City Council.

59
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:39,326
And ethnicity. We have 29 white, 29 black African

60
00:04:39,358 --> 00:04:43,314
American, 18 Hispanic Latinos and three Asian

61
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:45,720
Pacific Islanders. Next slide, please.

62
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,086
And right here I'm going to do a comparison and I really want

63
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:55,334
to break it down because I want to make sure that we're open and

64
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:58,666
everybody understand exactly how city council budget works. So I

65
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:01,690
tried to break it down a little further on this slide to kind of explain

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,982
exactly how it is. Our adopted budget in FY

67
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:07,034
22 was $13,604,307,

68
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:10,574
and that was

69
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:15,582
split between the office at $468,915.

70
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:23,506
So as you can see, the FY 22 operating budget was $7,502,640.

71
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:27,362
This is the money that council members use to pay

72
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,422
their staff for services and for office supplies.

73
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:35,442
It all of this comes from their operating budget.

74
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:38,806
So you make sure you understand that's what that is for. Then you have the

75
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:42,086
council district service fund, which is 5,500,000,

76
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:45,030
and the health benefits that I told you about earlier,

77
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:51,050
that is how we comprise of 13,604,317.

78
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,998
If you were to look at the budget book today, you will see that council's

79
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:58,590
budget seems to have increased, but it has not.

80
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,966
Literally, it hasn't. It is 15,000,508 $193

81
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:08,094
as of today. And the reason for that, as you can see, we had

82
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:11,874
restricted accounts, a credit of 5609.

83
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:15,426
We had a Hope adjustment of 3%, and that was 130,480.

84
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:18,866
And then we had a

85
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:22,338
council district fund carry forward over

86
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,310
of $1,779,005.

87
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,654
I want to explain the carry forward for you in case some people

88
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:32,902
may not understand what this is. In FY 21,

89
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:36,902
all of the council funds and the projects that were requested.

90
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:40,234
As you know, sometimes it takes a lot

91
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:44,314
to get these done, and I want everybody to know that the council members work

92
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:47,850
diligently. We have a process. First of all, it has to be reviewed

93
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,338
by legal and then the administration has to approve

94
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:55,146
it. So sometimes it takes a little longer for these projects

95
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:58,906
to go into fruition. So if the project has been reviewed

96
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:02,366
by legal and it has been approved by the administration,

97
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,286
but we have not purchased the items yet or they have not completed

98
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:09,694
it, those funds can be rolled and forwarded and carried

99
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:13,510
over. So that's why you have a carry forward of 1,000,007, seven,

100
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,606
nine, five. And that is why the budget looks like it increased at

101
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:20,360
the present day. Next slide, please.

102
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:29,562
So for now, we are projecting to have $13,985,308

103
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,842
in city council's budget, and that comprises again

104
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:34,374
of the operating budget,

105
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:39,150
$7,857,842.

106
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,782
Council district service fund,

107
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:44,318
5,500,000, and health benefits,

108
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:47,940
$627,466.

109
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,780
Next slide, please.

110
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,906
These are the It. As I stated before that a

111
00:07:56,928 --> 00:08:00,566
lot of times it seems as if the budget is big, but council

112
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:03,866
member budget is mainly staff and driven

113
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:07,086
by it. That is why these are here to show you

114
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:11,118
some of the It driven costs that you will have application services

115
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:14,862
increased by 30,657. And any

116
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:18,194
hits questions, I would ask that you would direct that to hits, because these

117
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:21,966
are the numbers that I received from the It department.

118
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,370
Data services decreased by $11,283.

119
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,294
Voice services decreased by $3,244.

120
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:34,274
Voice labors decreased by $509. Next slide

121
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:38,066
please. Egis revolving fund service decreased

122
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:44,202
by $25. Voice Services wireless increased by $3,192.

123
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:48,620
Chronos chargeback increased $247.

124
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,586
Next slide please. Overall you

125
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:54,166
can see as I stated early,

126
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:58,462
91.39% of city

127
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:02,046
council's budget is allocated to personnel. And then

128
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:05,934
you have 7.28% which is in other services and charges.

129
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:08,318
And out of the services and charges,

130
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,970
78% is hits related charges,

131
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,790
1.29% is supplies, and then you have 0.4%

132
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,800
for equipment. Next slide please.

133
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,246
So this is Council District Service Fund. Carry forward over from FY 21.

134
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:32,090
As I stated before, there's 1,779,000

135
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,366
worth of council district service funds that we had to carry

136
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:38,220
over that were not completed in FY 21.

137
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,602
We are proposing what we adopted 5,500,000

138
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:46,126
for FY 22. As of today, we don't know how

139
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:49,534
much will be carried forward to FY 23. We will know that amount

140
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:52,970
on June 30. When the fiscal year ends,

141
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,054
we are projecting to get another 5,500,000 in council

142
00:09:57,102 --> 00:10:00,020
district service Fund for FY 23.

143
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,180
Next slide please.

144
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,086
Right here are major projects, and I just want everybody to

145
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,086
know that we have approximately 350

146
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:15,570
to 400 council district service projects

147
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,290
that are performed annually with this money. And on here,

148
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,334
I just basically put the major projects,

149
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:27,146
projects that are very expensive and

150
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:30,954
a lot of funding is needed for these. So they have increased from

151
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:34,974
last year. As far as major projects. On these two pages you can go

152
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:38,702
through and see all of the major projects that the council members are doing.

153
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:42,078
And as I stated, these projects are

154
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:45,934
really important things to the city. That's why

155
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:49,614
I say these council members are working hard. We go through legal.

156
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:52,718
I know there's been a lot of talk about council district service funds,

157
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:56,706
but legal reviews them, the administration approves

158
00:10:56,738 --> 00:11:00,630
it. We make sure that all contracts are

159
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,338
accurate before we do any work with any of these major projects

160
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:07,560
or any projects. Next slide please.

161
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,394
This is a slide of the priorities and

162
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:16,282
initiatives that the council members have stated are their top two.

163
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,770
These are the top two, they have several, but this shows

164
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,282
by district which initiatives they have stated to be priorities,

165
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:28,046
initiative as their top two. And the next page shows

166
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:32,266
the at large council district service funds, council district

167
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:35,970
members. These are their priorities and their initiatives.

168
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,500
Next slide please.

169
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,370
Looking at this, you can see that $4,743,915

170
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,170
are allocated to HPW, that is the council district's

171
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,466
service fund, and it is broken down based on how much money we allocated

172
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:57,430
in FY 22 for these projects.

173
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,410
So HPW and HPD are the most ones that

174
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,394
council district service funds are allocated to. Next slide please.

175
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,942
Appendix and then in the appendix we have the restricted

176
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:14,006
accounts, because as I stated, hits restricted accounts really

177
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:17,390
has a major important part in the council members budget.

178
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,934
Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions for me at this time?

179
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:25,682
That was such a great presentation. You do an excellent job,

180
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:28,562
you and your entire staff. Thank you.

181
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,290
Council member Cayman.

182
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,442
Ms. V, thank you for everything. You're welcome.

183
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:39,142
And to the new staff, welcome. We're so happy

184
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:43,462
to have you. And, of course, Miss Love, thank you for always being

185
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:46,966
there. You do so

186
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:51,238
much for our offices, from our budget meetings

187
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:55,500
to, again, tracking, I think you said over 400

188
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,274
projects that we're each pushing through all

189
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,554
of the time. So, again, huge appreciation

190
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:06,254
to your office in terms of needs that you see either for

191
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:10,138
your office specifically or as council,

192
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:13,822
what do you foresee in the coming future as some of those

193
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,058
needs? So I have conferred with several of the

194
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:20,562
council members, and I do know that they are short

195
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:23,602
staffed and the needs that they have in their office,

196
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:27,458
if they could have more staff members, because right now

197
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:31,266
they are stretched pretty wide based on all of the work that's

198
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:34,534
going on in their offices. And there are minimum four to

199
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:37,974
five staff members in every office, and the need to have

200
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:41,942
more people in their office would be great. And I've always said

201
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:45,562
that the council district service fund is great, and they've asked for more

202
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,226
because they can't complete all of their projects because they're kind

203
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:52,826
of waiting toward the end because they don't have enough money to do all the

204
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:56,942
things that the constituents are asking for. I certainly

205
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:00,094
echo the need for more staff, I think our

206
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:03,710
council staff and a huge thank you to all of our council staff.

207
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,810
We did a tally in a poll of our district,

208
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,686
most, of course, per usual three one one calls, but also most calls

209
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:16,606
of a district office. I don't know how my staff does it, but they're incredible.

210
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:19,974
And we could always I think I speak for every at least

211
00:14:20,012 --> 00:14:23,446
district office of we could always use and at large. Okay. And at

212
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:26,678
large, we can always use more. Just so,

213
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:30,070
Ms. Vernita, for the public's knowledge,

214
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,066
the council members, our salaries are

215
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:38,918
not set by the city, is that correct? Yes. Your salary

216
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:42,954
is based on the judges at the county. And in

217
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:46,462
terms of I mean, we're covered by insurance and things like that.

218
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:49,774
But as council members, we don't have things

219
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:53,262
like FMLA, is that correct? That is correct. But we were

220
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:57,390
able to get, at least for our chiefs of staff that had an exception previously,

221
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,140
coverage for paid parental leave and other benefits.

222
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,482
That is correct. Okay. I just wanted that to be clear. Thank you. Okay,

223
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:08,316
thank you. Council Member

224
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:11,190
David Robinson. Yeah. And just to build on that question,

225
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,656
the recent Hope adjustment, ms.

226
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:18,292
Jones, if you could comment on that, how that affected the salaries of our

227
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:21,850
staff and for that matter, council members, if you could.

228
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm sorry. The hope, the city employment,

229
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,488
the home contract yes. And what was the question,

230
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:34,044
if you could state out loud for the record how that affected our

231
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:39,084
staff and our personal salaries. So what happens is the

232
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:42,796
increase is 3% and it is based on an average of the

233
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,332
council members in their office. And because council members

234
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:49,840
have to have the same budget, we average out the highest office

235
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,436
and whatever that is times 3%, that is determined

236
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:57,456
how we allocate the 3% and that increases everybody's budget

237
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:00,916
the same. Thank you. But the council members do

238
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:04,836
not get a 3%, right? Correct. That's what

239
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:06,550
I wanted to hear. Thank you.

240
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,156
Well, thank you again for your presentation. Thank you to your entire staff.

241
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:16,472
We lean on you all for so much and

242
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:20,504
kind of the backbone of our offices, which are extension of

243
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:24,156
all of our constituents in each district and at large. So thank

244
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:27,310
you again and you are dismissed. Thank you.

245
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,368
We will now move on to the public comment period.

246
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:37,120
We will start with the virtual public speakers. Please press star

247
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,944
six to unmute when your name is called and

248
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:43,920
the first name is ms. Saba Blandy.

249
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,776
Good afternoon again. I had

250
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,124
a question, a couple I was curious, what is

251
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:54,564
one piece of information you would most like to know

252
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:58,420
if you were able to survey every single one of your constituents

253
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,436
and what do you think are the most effective efforts to engage

254
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:06,468
your constituents in your district? And I'm just curious

255
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:10,010
if anyone has some new efforts planned for the coming year?

256
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,836
Okay, I'm going to ask you, Ms. Blanding, to repeat that a little slower one

257
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:19,272
more time. Oh, man, I'm sorry, Councilman Member

258
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:22,888
Pollard, I was trying to go slower. Okay. I was curious

259
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:26,780
what one piece of information you would most like to know

260
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,396
if you were able to survey every single one of your constituents?

261
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:34,684
I was also curious what you think are the most effective efforts to engage

262
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:38,596
your constituents in your districts. And I was also curious what

263
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:41,350
are some new efforts planned for the coming year?

264
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,420
Okay, so for my office, and I know for everyone,

265
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,436
it's probably different, but one piece of information I would like to know is

266
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:54,296
how they feel about our constituent response times when

267
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:58,056
they reach out to our office, either by telephone or email.

268
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:01,844
Do they feel as if their issues and concerns are being addressed

269
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:05,676
promptly? I think the best way to engage the

270
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:09,464
constituents is by showing up in person, whether that's an HOA or a civic

271
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:13,070
club. But people like to see you active and in person.

272
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,376
I think it's a great way to develop relationships and also a great way

273
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:20,736
in which to communicate and understand their needs from the

274
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:22,130
grassroots level.

275
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,750
Anyone else in the horse you want to chime in?

276
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,900
And your third question, Ms. Blanding.

277
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,084
I was just curious if anyone had some new efforts they wanted to try this

278
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:39,460
year in terms of engaging constituents.

279
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,156
If anyone had some new ideas, what ideas

280
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,170
do you have?

281
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,540
Oh, well, I mean, I always think efforts

282
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,240
to to provide surveys are good, and I know traditionally there's

283
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,340
club engagement, but as much as I can engage here,

284
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,196
civic club, my husband has a meeting every month for

285
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:06,636
our civic club. So I was just curious what you all like to

286
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:10,784
try. I think most of us like to get a lot of our ideas from

287
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:14,096
the public. We really work for you. So many of the times that

288
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:17,412
you see us responding to issues or concerns is based

289
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:21,316
on your engagement. So it

290
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:25,044
would be great to hear from you as a constituent, what ways

291
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:29,328
in which you think we can better communicate and collaborate

292
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:33,428
with you and the community. So if you

293
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:36,840
have an idea or something you would like to share, maybe even not today,

294
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,456
but feel free to email us if you have ideas on ways in

295
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:43,710
which we can best communicate and engage with you going forward.

296
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,064
Absolutely. I appreciate the invitation. You're welcome. The next speaker,

297
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:51,500
Ms. Barbara Herndon.

298
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,550
Barbara Herndon, please press star six to unmute.

299
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,280
Amanda Shy, please press star six to unmute.

300
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,316
Hi, and just briefly, my last name is she.

301
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:18,430
Thank you. Thank you for your time today.

302
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,712
So many of the other departments

303
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:26,156
have metrics or outcomes outlined in the budgets that they

304
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:29,568
publish. So as representatives of constituents, do you

305
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:33,612
all have target metrics? What do you consider outcomes?

306
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:37,136
And then I have another thought, which is

307
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:41,104
that the slide 15 in terms of the distribution of the CDSF

308
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:45,152
funds, that was really helpful. As a constituent

309
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:48,676
of District I, I would just like to express that I'm interested in

310
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:52,500
seeing more funds allocated for Case Education, Do,

311
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,816
N, and HPL, all departments and programs that

312
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,156
have expressed unmet needs throughout these presentations.

313
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:03,048
So I'll return to my question, which is basically,

314
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:08,156
what are some target metrics and outcomes that

315
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:09,390
you all have in mind?

316
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,100
So as it pertains to metrics, I can speak for the District J office.

317
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,096
What we like to do is put out initiatives and projects and ideas

318
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:22,944
that we have many times that are brand new, and then we have to

319
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:26,896
wait and see what the outcomes are. We're really a results based

320
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,576
office. And so whether it's with supplemental trash or

321
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:34,244
a District J Patrol program, new initiatives that are

322
00:21:34,282 --> 00:21:37,796
just now coming to the district, many times it's going to be

323
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:42,016
based off the feedback, the engagement, how many people are receptive,

324
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:45,488
and responsive to the things that we're doing, the feedback that we

325
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:49,284
hear at the civic clubs and the HOA meetings on if it's beneficial

326
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:52,856
or not. Do they believe it's something that they want

327
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:56,796
to see their tax dollars spent on? And for most of us, I think

328
00:21:56,818 --> 00:22:00,380
that's how we are able to gauge if a project is worthwhile

329
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,728
going into the next budget year to fund through our council district

330
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:06,350
service funds going forward.

331
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,220
And was there one other question that you may have had.

332
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,266
That was my main question. Do any of the other council members

333
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:23,760
want to share?

334
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,574
None at the moment, because I think we're running behind on

335
00:22:30,612 --> 00:22:34,206
time. But I'm sure if you reach out to your individual

336
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:37,938
district council member, they will collaborate with you going forward.

337
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,810
But thank you for your questions. Next is Jason Oliver.

338
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,466
All right, if you'll indulge me, I want to start off just by really

339
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:52,758
I really appreciate CDSF and these presentations because I

340
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:56,178
know that you all create a lot of these programs directly

341
00:22:56,194 --> 00:22:59,718
in response to what community members are asking for. So some of

342
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:03,334
the ones I'm excited about and glad to see, a lot of the trash pickup

343
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,158
and drainage work, the Senior Development Boys

344
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:10,922
and Girls Club and District K, the Public

345
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:14,186
Safety, the more expansive public safety, street lights and

346
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,678
sidewalks stuff happening in District F, seeing some of the

347
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:20,986
Vision Zero. And then the WiFi

348
00:23:21,018 --> 00:23:23,680
access is huge in District H,

349
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,934
there's a lot. And then the community beautification work

350
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:31,026
that's happening in district, just some of the ones that kind of stuck out to

351
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:34,402
me that I really wanted to highlight. And now to go into

352
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:38,178
my questions. So first,

353
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:41,794
where are we in terms of the impartment inspection reform? Just curious

354
00:23:41,842 --> 00:23:45,382
about that project that I know we've heard about over the years. And then

355
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:48,706
second, does any district and this goes into Council Member Pollard's

356
00:23:48,738 --> 00:23:52,902
question about engagement with constituents.

357
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:56,566
Does any district have good resources or processes explaining

358
00:23:56,598 --> 00:23:59,130
how the CDSF works to constituents,

359
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,318
explaining how it works, what projects are proposed and eligible,

360
00:24:03,414 --> 00:24:06,942
and the process for submission? I think CDSF is a huge

361
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:10,494
opportunity to widen the net of how people know

362
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,174
about what the district is doing and then really getting engaged in that

363
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:17,794
process of directly participating there. So, yeah,

364
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:21,294
that's my idea for engagement. So regarding

365
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:25,070
the apartment inspection ordinance,

366
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,058
that is something that's pending at the moment. I know that Council Member Leticia Plumber

367
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:32,806
is taking the lead on that. And so those discussions are

368
00:24:32,828 --> 00:24:36,130
still ongoing on the best considerations

369
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,390
for that as it pertains to the council district service funds.

370
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,646
Many times what we do is we reach out to all of our neighborhood associations

371
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:48,074
and stakeholders within the community and ask them what do they like

372
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:52,358
to see regarding if it's improved parks,

373
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:56,086
if it's improved infrastructure, do they want to see more police

374
00:24:56,118 --> 00:24:59,306
presence? So every community and district is unique

375
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:02,986
and has its own dynamics. And so many times the requests

376
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:06,590
that come into our office for things that they want to see, we prioritize.

377
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,690
And then those are what we spend the dollars on through our council's funds.

378
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,646
Council Member Cayman Jason, to your question about outreach

379
00:25:17,678 --> 00:25:21,430
in terms of determining some CDSF, I know multiple council members,

380
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,794
including my office, have started even doing surveys

381
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:30,326
on social media. So, for example, we fund air monitors that

382
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:33,466
are publicly accessible information. But where they should go up we

383
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:37,382
put a survey out, we ask for suggestions, and the locations

384
00:25:37,446 --> 00:25:41,146
are being determined based on that. I think it's a whole combination of things.

385
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,506
Council member newsletters always open to more information,

386
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:47,786
but you are asking some really important questions.

387
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:50,846
They're directed, I think, to all of us. But I think the best way to

388
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:54,634
get some of those responses or provide your suggestions is to individually

389
00:25:54,682 --> 00:25:58,226
reach out on that and also know that we

390
00:25:58,248 --> 00:26:01,906
leverage a lot of our dollars. So even though we get a

391
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:05,026
million dollars, 500 for mobility and

392
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:08,766
then 500 for just general operating projects

393
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,354
in our district, we leverage that money with the management

394
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:15,558
districts, with our Turs, with our county partners. So we try to

395
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:19,074
find outside dollars, even from the private sector to partner

396
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:22,906
with. So we may be able to turn $100,000

397
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:27,466
allocation into a $400,000 allocation just by working with other

398
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:30,954
entities that have similar interests in what we're trying

399
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:34,602
to do. So we appreciate all the

400
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:37,934
constituents feedback on ways in which we spend

401
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:41,706
your tax dollars. And if there's particular projects and initiatives

402
00:26:41,738 --> 00:26:45,066
that you see in your community that you like and you want to advocate

403
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:49,170
for going forward, please do. And if there are things that you don't like or

404
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,466
that you think are not beneficial that we're spending your tax dollars on, let us

405
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:56,642
know that as well. And that completes our public

406
00:26:56,696 --> 00:27:00,530
comment period for the City Council presentations.

407
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,580
And now we will move on to

408
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,506
welcome director Tina Pius and Valerie Berry to

409
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:13,290
provide the And Regulatory Affairs budget presentation.
