1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,282
Appreciate your insight. We will transition to Department of Neighborhoods

2
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:08,314
and their workshop. At this time, I'd like to welcome director Takarsha

3
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:11,550
Francis and Herbert Sims to the podium.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:20,410
Thank you, everyone, for showing up officially.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,070
Good afternoon, Director Francis.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:01:49,244
You welcome.

7
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,112
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair. Mayor Pretem,

8
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:56,472
as well as the other council members and representatives,

9
00:01:56,536 --> 00:02:00,064
our mayor in his absence, as well as those who are viewing by

10
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:03,564
HTV and our public speakers today. I am Takasha Francis,

11
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:07,276
the proud director of the Department of Neighborhoods for the City of Houston,

12
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:11,404
and I'm here to discuss our proposed Department of Neighborhoods FY

13
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:14,756
23 operating budget. Now, before I do that, I want

14
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:18,324
to first of all acknowledge the men and women of the Department of Neighborhoods who

15
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:22,544
could not be here today, but provide excellent, stellar service to Houstonians

16
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,184
every single day. My personal message to them, as I tell them often,

17
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:29,876
is how much I appreciate their professionalism, their flexibility,

18
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:33,096
and their ability to do so much with so little.

19
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:36,468
But I mostly appreciate that they are true public servants.

20
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:39,532
So thank you guys for everything that you do. Of course,

21
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:43,144
no team is complete without leadership, and I want to start off by acknowledging

22
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:46,984
some of our leadership today. To my immediate right is one of my assistant directors,

23
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,860
Mr. Herbert Sims, who is also our Finance Manager.

24
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,420
I'd like to ask the following leaders to also stand as I call their names.

25
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,152
Our Assistant Director, Mr. Reggie Harris, who is present with us,

26
00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:00,528
who oversees our Inspections and Public Services division.

27
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:04,320
Our finance Manager has already been acknowledged.

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,796
Our pio, Evangelina Behill, is behind you

29
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:11,660
all, taking wonderful pictures that you'll see later on in our social media channels.

30
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,016
Mr. Mark Cueva is our senior staff analyst, who is

31
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:18,996
also present with us. Ms. Mulaney, Morris and Joel

32
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:23,032
Aguere are our administrative coordinators in the director's office.

33
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,552
And now on to our division managers who are also present.

34
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:30,104
Ms. Rhonda. Saudder, Division Manager of the Mayor's Assistance

35
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:33,676
Office mr. Victor Gonzalez, who is the Division manager of

36
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:36,680
the Mayor's Office of Gang Prevention and Intervention.

37
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,636
Mr. Terrence O'Neill, division Manager of the Office of New Americans

38
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:44,560
and Immigrant Communities. And last but not least, Mr. Paul Green,

39
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,636
the Office of Neighborhood Engagement. These leaders are to be commended,

40
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:52,244
and I thank them for being partners with me every single day as we

41
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:55,808
deliver these services to the City of Houston. Found on the next slide.

42
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:59,776
Next slide, please. We begin today's

43
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:03,220
presentation with a snapshot of our functional organizational chart.

44
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,044
As you'll notice, this chart includes both personnel and operational

45
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:10,244
expenditures to comply with the performance based budget

46
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,796
criteria and format. Our divisions and expenditures are placed

47
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:17,644
into several programs. You'll also notice a subtle change in our

48
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:20,956
program titles. First with the Mayor's Office of Gang Prevention and

49
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,412
Intervention which houses our antigang programming and

50
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:28,880
grant funded auxiliary programs such as Gang Victims Federal Grant Program

51
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,356
Early Intervention Services and Harris County Probation Gang Intervention

52
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:37,296
and Prevention Program. You'll also see that we've added the Office of

53
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,844
Neighborhood Engagement. This office was created by

54
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:44,004
transferring five FTEs out of the Director's Office,

55
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:47,492
so it is a net neutral move. There is no additional cost,

56
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:51,244
and it is focused primarily on the Department's community programming

57
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:55,524
and civic participation. The programs housed in this division include,

58
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:59,176
but are not limited to complete communities University the

59
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,116
Mayor's Youth Council Volunteer Initiatives,

60
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:06,088
a month of Service program, the upcoming Signbusters program,

61
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:09,580
council Member Alcohorn and Neighborhood Matching Grants

62
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,616
Next slide, please. Now, the departmental

63
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:19,196
programming for the Department of Neighborhoods houses four major service areas

64
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:22,444
residential Code Enforcement, Community Engagement

65
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:25,904
and Neighborhood Initiatives, citizenship Assistance and

66
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:29,344
Language Access and Gang Prevention and intervention

67
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:33,428
services. Now, each slide will outline our major services,

68
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:36,976
the statutory requirements, additional financial grant

69
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:41,076
funded support, and then the financial and or societal impact for

70
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:44,536
each service. Now, for Brevity, I will touch on the service

71
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:48,372
and the financial and societal impact, and I will reference

72
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:51,608
funding when applicable. But I will stand open for any questions if you

73
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:55,032
have them thereafter. Starting with the Residential Code Enforcement

74
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:58,408
Division. This is our largest and most outward facing division.

75
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:02,524
Please note the statutory requirements and grant funding listed this

76
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:07,644
year. We have 26 Code Enforcement officers and inspector

77
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,840
positions budgeted on the General Fund.

78
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,824
43 Code Enforcement Officer and inspector positions are budgeted under

79
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:17,712
CDBG grant funds. However, in fiscal year 22,

80
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:21,504
we were greatly affected by an increase in turnover and so.

81
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,868
Currently, we have a 19% vacancy rate on the General Fund

82
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:28,208
and a 28% vacancy rate including grant funds.

83
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:32,216
So what we have is a total of 69 budgeted Code

84
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:36,248
Enforcement Officer positions that equates to 50 boots on

85
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:39,400
the ground and 19 vacancies.

86
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,810
When we look at the financial next slide, please.

87
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,596
When we look at the financial and societal impact of

88
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:51,464
this particular service area, residential Code Enforcement carries

89
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:55,752
both financial and societal impacts. Blight such as dilapidated

90
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:59,536
structures, high weeds, and junk motor vehicles continue to pose a

91
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:02,956
major threat to public health and safety. Societal impacts

92
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:06,512
include safer healthier communities with

93
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:10,784
less crime, urban decay, and increases economic vitality

94
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:14,192
and opportunity. The financial impacts of Code enforcement

95
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:18,224
mirror those social impacts and also include a lowered maintenance

96
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:22,052
cost for these Blighted properties, increased property values,

97
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:25,624
and tax collections. However, the rising cost to

98
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:30,196
abate Blighted properties due to more expensive labor and supplies,

99
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:34,860
including fuel, primarily may increase the city's expenses.

100
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,132
Next slide, please. Our next service

101
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:42,796
area is Gang Prevention and Intervention, which is housed within the

102
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:46,132
Mayor's Office of Gang Prevention and Intervention. Most notably,

103
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:50,204
this division oversees programs that promote awareness, build resistance

104
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:53,584
skills, and educate on the dangers of gang involvement and

105
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:57,484
juvenile delinquency. Please note the statutory requirements

106
00:07:57,612 --> 00:08:01,344
and the additional support and impact. Next slide,

107
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:05,220
please. The next service

108
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,900
area is our Community Engagement and Neighborhood Initiatives.

109
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,928
This area refers to two of our areas the Mayor's Assistance Office and

110
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:17,496
the Office of Neighborhood Engagement. Please take note of

111
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:20,810
the statutory requirements and additional financial support.

112
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,172
Now of course, as we've noted previously, we changed the Mayor's Assistance

113
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:29,720
Office from the Mayor's Citizens Assistance Office to be more inclusive

114
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,968
of all residents in the City of Houston. I'm very proud

115
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:36,876
of our one of a kind collaboration of workshops and community program

116
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:40,096
through the Office of Neighborhood Engagement. And I also would

117
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:43,516
like to take this moment to acknowledge our Citizenship Assistance

118
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:46,988
and Language access services through the Office of New Americans

119
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:50,128
and Immigrant Communities. And it is a thriving program

120
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:53,764
that is utilized throughout the City and a major component of

121
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:57,184
citizenship assistance. Now, when we look at the financial

122
00:08:57,232 --> 00:09:01,432
and societal impact of all three of these service delivery areas social

123
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:05,764
programming such as youth prevention and intervention services, super neighborhoods

124
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:09,316
and citizenship Assistance increase civic engagement,

125
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:13,224
public awareness and education, and it empowers communities to

126
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:16,716
advocate and improve their quality of life. We saw that

127
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:20,904
in the last presentation. These programs provide similar financial

128
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:24,904
impacts as Code enforcement indirectly over time through implementation

129
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:28,536
of the various programming and services. I believe my colleague,

130
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,856
Chief Samuel Pena said in his presentation, prevention is key.

131
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,376
So these programs are a way for us to prevent some

132
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:39,380
of the issues by providing appropriate education to the communities that need them

133
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,136
on how to be good neighbors and how to follow City protocol

134
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:45,350
and programs. Next slide, please.

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,960
Now, as we look at the anticipated growth or reduction in population

136
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,596
serves and how that actually affects our budget, we're always cognizant

137
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:58,648
of how that will also affect our ability to deliver services.

138
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:02,616
Now, as the City grows, we have to consider these challenges to maintain a

139
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:06,136
service level that's not sustainable with our current budget.

140
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:10,184
As I mentioned before, rising costs, particularly in labor

141
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:13,404
and supplies fuel this will affect the number

142
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:16,696
of abatements that can be completed within the limited budget

143
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:20,188
we've been given. So, for example, as we procure new Lands

144
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:23,884
and Grounds maintenance and debris removal contracts in the upcoming

145
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:28,080
fiscal year, we face fuel costs that have increased 55%

146
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,776
since the last contract procurement in 2018.

147
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:36,052
Currently, Code Enforcement officers are expected to inspect over one

148
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:39,476
over 13 sq. Mi out of a

149
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:43,816
total of 627 sq. Mi of the entire city. And our Community

150
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:47,752
Liaisons average 400,000 residents based

151
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:51,672
on the super neighborhoods they are required to give services to.

152
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:55,336
So as the City continues to increase in population,

153
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:58,924
our budgets will get tighter, these numbers will grow and our

154
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:02,270
services will be stretched. Next slide please.

155
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,024
Don's revenue is primarily the money that we collect from

156
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:12,304
liens from Property Abatement Section. Ten, four,

157
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:15,632
five, three of the City's Municipal Code allows us to place

158
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:19,492
liens on properties to recoup the City's expenses as a result

159
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:23,184
of demolitions of dangerous buildings, weed and debris removal

160
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:27,136
on vacant lots, and securing properties. We recoup

161
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:30,736
these funds either from voluntary payment or the legal

162
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:34,404
process of foreclosing on these liens. Now, you'll notice

163
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:37,896
in this slide a large decrease in revenue under licenses and

164
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:41,796
permits. The reason for that is that Don no longer collects the deposit

165
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:45,470
fees that we previously transferred from Houston Public Works.

166
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,590
Next slide, please.

167
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,056
Our revenue highlights include a projected increase in fiscal

168
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,712
year 23 revenue collection by approximately 8%

169
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:01,792
over FY 22 estimates. The change is a projection based

170
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,564
on pandemic restrictions being eased. Our current revenue

171
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:09,504
collection is based on trend analysis as well as external variables

172
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:12,180
due to passive collection methods.

173
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,390
Next slide, please.

174
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,764
Last year, we projected our FY 22

175
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:23,288
expenditures to be around $12.4 million,

176
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:26,872
based on the most recent data we project to hit that mark.

177
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:30,756
Our proposed budget for FY 23 includes few minor

178
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:34,096
changes, but overall the proposed budget, which includes

179
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:37,944
a 1% or 126,000 personnel

180
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:41,516
budget increase from FY 22 estimates due to

181
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:45,464
Hope allowances and health care and pension obligations.

182
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:49,008
So that is the only difference in what we are presenting today.

183
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:52,732
Next slide, please. Now, the next slide

184
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:56,316
here provides a snapshot of our personnel versus nonpersonal

185
00:12:56,348 --> 00:13:00,384
expenditures. In the first circle graph, you'll notice we have personnel

186
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:03,456
expenditures at 68% of Don's overall budget.

187
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:07,696
The remaining 32 in the second pie graph shows our non

188
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:11,560
personnel services, which include miscellaneous support services,

189
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,172
supplies and services like computers, printing,

190
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:18,884
publications, uniforms, document filing

191
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,836
services and then, of course, restricted accounts as determined by Central

192
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,692
Finance, which include fuel, health insurance,

193
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:28,590
HR, client services and vehicle services.

194
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,564
Next slide, please. Now, slide number twelve

195
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:36,940
provides a detailed explanation of our expenditure net changes.

196
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,576
One major change was $157,000 for

197
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:44,080
Hope allowances as well as health benefits and a restricted account

198
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,640
return. Overall, there is little to no change from the FY 22

199
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,532
operating budget. Based on the proposed 2023

200
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:55,748
budget of 12.6 million. The recent change

201
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,040
has been 1.9% from last year's

202
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,276
budget or the current budget. Next slide,

203
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:02,890
please.

204
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,560
Now, under our expenditure highlights, you'll notice that there is a 15%

205
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,720
increase of restricted accounts. There is 2.3%

206
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,448
reduction in our supplies and service line items.

207
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:21,336
And then of course, as I mentioned previously, 68% of Don's overall

208
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:24,760
budget is allocated to personnel expenses.

209
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,476
This concludes my presentation. And before we move to Q and

210
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:31,724
A, we just like you to take a moment at your leisure to include additional

211
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:35,772
information in the appendices for your viewing and accomplishment

212
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:38,944
pleasure. I now stand open for your questions. Thank you,

213
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:42,640
Director Francis. First up, we will have Council Member Michael Kubosh.

214
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,096
Thank you, council member. Director Francis. That was excellent.

215
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,828
Thank you. And your voice is easy to hear. Thank you very much. Thank you,

216
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:53,510
sir. Bandit Signs? Yes.

217
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,716
Where are we on trying to get these things removed?

218
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:01,064
Are we writing tickets for them? Are we just pulling them up?

219
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:04,996
Well, I'm very glad that you asked that question. So, what we've

220
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:08,636
done since last year council Member Alcorn reached out

221
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,492
personally and wanted to know about a volunteer Bandit Sign program and so

222
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:16,392
for the last year, we've been working with Harris County so that we could combine

223
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:20,544
our efforts and kind of come out of that silo mentality to develop a

224
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:24,236
volunteer program. Now, one of the things that has actually held

225
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:27,392
us up is the fact that their bandit sign program, of course,

226
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:31,476
deals with the ETJ when they have a different statutory requirement for

227
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:35,524
actually picking up the bandit signs and assessing fines. So what we're doing

228
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:38,964
right now is trying to put together a program that

229
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:42,608
will allow a combined training so that volunteers can be

230
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:46,296
trained to either volunteer in the county or within the city. So let

231
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:49,252
me ask you, can any citizen safely,

232
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:52,920
without getting hit by traffic, remove a sign,

233
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,732
a bandit sign, from a median area in between

234
00:15:56,786 --> 00:16:00,030
the roads? You can. But,

235
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,184
Council Member Kubash, I'm smiling because I have to admit,

236
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:07,916
sometimes I do it well, but I don't want you to do

237
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:11,824
it. I know, and I'm not going to do it. Sometimes I want to stop

238
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:14,768
and get stuff out of the road, but I realize that I might become a

239
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:18,048
part of the road. So another thing is

240
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:21,972
we're in political season, the crazy season. Yes. They're sticking these things

241
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:25,904
all over the place. Absolutely. They're attaching them to road signs,

242
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:30,390
these big four baits, and we need some.

243
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,180
I see a lot of them in the ETJ as well,

244
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,084
so we need to do something about that. Are we writing these folks citations?

245
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:41,704
Yes, sir, we are writing citations. You want a picture of them sent to you

246
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:45,176
or sent in three? One. One. You do whatever you feel is necessary except pick

247
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,588
up that sign. You call me, you tell me, and I'll go over there and

248
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:52,136
pick it up. But in all seriousness, Council Member Kubosh, we are very cognizant

249
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:55,900
of the fact that political season is one. Permission to extend?

250
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,296
No, you don't need it. Go ahead. Okay. But I need it so

251
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:04,752
very quickly because I do realize other people that just means Kubash's time

252
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:07,730
has expired. Put me back in.

253
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,044
We're working on trying to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of making

254
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:15,876
sure that we're getting the signs up, hence the volunteer program.

255
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:20,656
But we're also looking at ways to better educate our candidates

256
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:24,816
with the importance of being able to go behind. Once you've put the signs

257
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:28,116
up, please go back and pick them up. So we're working on that, and we're

258
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,650
aware of the issue, but thank you for bringing it to light today.

259
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,636
Vice Mayor Pro TEM Martha Castex Tatum. Thank you,

260
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:37,752
chair. Director Francis. Thank you for the presentation.

261
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:42,044
Last year, one of our budget amendments was for

262
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:46,148
each district to have a code enforcement

263
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:50,000
officer to work with our individual offices,

264
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,144
and that passed. However, that hasn't happened. I see that we

265
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:58,248
have quite a few vacancies in the code enforcement

266
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,116
arena. However, I'm very interested, and I think it

267
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:05,732
would be advantageous for us as we work

268
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:09,008
to protect neighborhoods alongside the Department of Neighborhoods,

269
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:13,732
to have a direct contact and individual code enforcement

270
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:17,256
officer that works with our office. I liked when we

271
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:21,284
had that individual liaison that worked with our offices.

272
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:24,936
I know that staffing is a challenge,

273
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:29,404
but I would like to see us move towards having someone

274
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:32,892
specific that we can work

275
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,860
with in our offices to help with the enforcement

276
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,492
in our districts. With all due respect

277
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:44,076
to the mayor's office and Renee and Rhonda,

278
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:48,144
they do a phenomenal job, but God help them, there's no way

279
00:18:48,342 --> 00:18:51,840
that they can manage the number of code enforcement

280
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,796
issues that we deal in this entire city. But I know

281
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,900
that residents like having that specific person.

282
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,296
I like having a specific person. Is there a

283
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:07,080
way we can move towards having an individual person

284
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,192
from your office that works with our individual offices for code

285
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:14,664
enforcement issues? Sure. And actually Vice Mayor Pro Tim.

286
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:18,172
You currently have one. So I know that you remember, because you were here

287
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:22,076
when I came in as Director, that we did have a specific liaison for

288
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:26,104
all of the council members because at that time, we were about 20,000 cases

289
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:30,588
behind. And so the Mayor's Assistance Office, that is part of their responsibility

290
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:34,016
to communicate any issues that you all are having and

291
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:37,856
to basically help you solve the issues that you're having or that citizens are

292
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:41,296
having in your particular district. We also have a

293
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:44,996
call number I'm sorry,

294
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:48,596
a customer service number directly to IPS. So if there is an

295
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:51,716
issue where citizens, they can call three one one and then they

296
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:55,608
can follow up. So what I think part of the disconnect might be,

297
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,856
and I'm happy to take this call offline is if

298
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:02,376
there's another level of service that you're looking for from the liaisons who are

299
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:05,464
assigned to the super neighborhoods in your district. I'm happy to have

300
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:08,956
that conversation so that we can be more efficient in how we

301
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:12,396
are actually communicating. And I will go back and take another look at that

302
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:16,568
budget amendment regarding a specific code enforcement officer to each district,

303
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:19,996
because currently our code enforcement officers, as I

304
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,244
mentioned before, there are 50 on the ground. We do have vacancies

305
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:26,624
that are available, but I think every director will share with you all

306
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:29,612
that the city has not been immune to the great resignation,

307
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:32,932
nor have we been immune to people having other

308
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:36,496
options that they choose to pursue. In code enforcement, unfortunately,

309
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:40,612
is not at the top of that list. Nor is our salary competitive enough.

310
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:44,256
So that's another issue that we'd like to kind of deal with.

311
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:47,656
But I'm happy to take that conversation offline, have a more specific

312
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:51,176
conversation about what your office is looking for, and then we can make

313
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:54,692
sure our liaisons are making those adjustments.

314
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,848
Okay. And then the other question I'll put you back in queue, if you don't

315
00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:00,972
mind. You have you 1 minute of fame. I gave you three.

316
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:04,616
Council Member Sally Alcorn. Yes. Thank you, Chair.

317
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:08,384
And thank you, Director. I want to get a good handle on the number of

318
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:11,664
inspectors that you have. You said 56 out of the general fund.

319
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:15,152
It looks like you're including 53 in

320
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:18,364
code enforcement in this budget.

321
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:21,140
Then you said 43 are from CDBG.

322
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,550
Okay. So we're not getting more.

323
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,180
You have 19 vacancies. Are those all within the general fund or were those

324
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,576
CDBG or combined? How many do you

325
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:37,176
want to have total? From the general fund? Yeah, you need

326
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:41,224
to have 300, but you've got about nine.

327
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:44,776
Sure. So according to my

328
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,024
notes here, we have 69 budgeted

329
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:51,224
positions. From the general fund or from both? That and CDBG?

330
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:53,676
For both. Okay. For both? For both. All right.

331
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:57,496
And out of those 69 positions,

332
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:00,764
26 are general fund, 43 are CDBG

333
00:22:00,812 --> 00:22:04,576
funded. Okay. In looking at your performance measures, I'm just

334
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:07,936
curious if you're going to keep the same amount or you're hopefully going to fill

335
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:12,032
the vacancies. I mean, I'm sure you're actively pursuing people to fill these vacancies.

336
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:15,556
Sure. Because you're talking about going from 250

337
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:18,960
daily inspections to 350 daily inspections.

338
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,016
Yes. You're talking about junk motor vehicles removed

339
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:28,632
last year. You had a target of 3500. You guys got to 860.

340
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:32,200
You're doubling that for next year. I'm looking at

341
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,510
weeded lots. You want to go from 10,000 this year to 15,000.

342
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,428
And my question is just simply how are you going to do that without

343
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:46,712
adding significantly to the number of inspectors? And I appreciate

344
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:50,416
that question. The first thing I'd like to point out, and I'm thankful that you

345
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:55,168
have actually made that picture a lot more clearer, is that our

346
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:58,528
code enforcement staff has been able to do a phenomenal job

347
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:02,240
considering the fact that we don't have enough code enforcement officers.

348
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,824
And in order for them to do that, that means a lot of double

349
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:09,204
work, double areas, which is part of the reason why

350
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:12,644
we can't necessarily dedicate in one particular place.

351
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:15,896
What I can say to you, Council Member Alcorn, is that we will continue to

352
00:23:15,918 --> 00:23:19,588
work assiduously to bring in code enforcement officers.

353
00:23:19,604 --> 00:23:22,888
But let me be very blunt about what we've experienced in the last year.

354
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:26,552
We've had a lot of people sign on and then they leave within

355
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:29,908
a month. So whether it's been I don't know if it's

356
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:32,476
that they just had a different idea of what the job was, maybe they got

357
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:35,196
out in the heat and decided they didn't want to do it. But we have

358
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:38,472
not had people. The turnover has been considerable.

359
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:41,824
So what I can tell you that we are attempting to

360
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:45,104
do to reach this goal has really been not only

361
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:48,544
with our inspections, but with our Abatement budget. We have

362
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:52,276
become much more aggressive about correcting the issues through our

363
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,164
Abatement budget in addition to giving notification to

364
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:59,508
recalcitrate property owners, because ultimately, at the end of the day,

365
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:02,756
communities want it corrected. They don't really

366
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:06,212
care about the inspection. They just want to wake up and not see this lot

367
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:10,276
next door. So part of what we are looking to do in terms of accomplishing

368
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:13,448
that feat, which is what we have done in terms, of course, correction over the

369
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:17,612
last few years is focused more on the correction side, which is why our

370
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:21,116
ability to recoup on the lien foreclosure side instead of

371
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:24,750
relying on passive people that just come in and decide to pay the money.

372
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,428
We have to become more aggressive as a city in going after the money that

373
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:31,328
we're putting out. So that's how we plan to do that.

374
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:34,736
Council Member Amy Pick. Thank you,

375
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:38,384
Chair. And thank you, Director. Kind of similar to Council Member Alcorn's question about

376
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:41,616
inspections. You talked about the anticipated growth and the

377
00:24:41,638 --> 00:24:44,708
constraints there. Do you have goals as far as what the

378
00:24:44,714 --> 00:24:48,096
turnaround time will be for inspections for this next fiscal

379
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,392
year and not just the first inspection, but also the look back inspections

380
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,492
as well? Well, as you know, council Member part of the ability

381
00:24:55,556 --> 00:24:58,984
to go back and do the check back inspections that we do after

382
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:02,660
the initial really depends on the bodies we have on the ground.

383
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,076
So what we're trying to do now as we're looking at our positions is trying

384
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:12,472
to figure out how we can possibly go back and reconfigure

385
00:25:12,536 --> 00:25:15,756
our ability to go back and do those. But I'll be very honest with you.

386
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:19,676
Based on the limited amount of people we have, I don't see those times changing.

387
00:25:19,788 --> 00:25:23,024
What I can say to you, however, is that we have

388
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:26,412
now started utilizing under the code an emergency provision.

389
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:29,920
Because, sadly, so many of the vacant lots that we have

390
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,104
or some of the dilapidated buildings that we have in our communities

391
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:36,756
are in such disrepair and are so high

392
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:39,984
that they actually qualify through our emergency abatements,

393
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:43,520
which are given to us under the code. And so one of the

394
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,048
focuses that we've done at this particular point now hasn't been as much of

395
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:50,068
a focus so much on the checkback inspections,

396
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:53,764
but really looking at our inventory, what breaches

397
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:57,512
the emergency threshold and really trying to address those a lot

398
00:25:57,566 --> 00:26:01,196
faster. So it has a tangential effect on our ability to get

399
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:04,056
back around. So even if we're not able to get back on a checkback inspection,

400
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:07,788
if something rolls on our radar that is emergency level,

401
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:11,776
then we address that with a level of priority. So I

402
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:14,896
hope that answers the question a little better. Yes, thank you.

403
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:18,112
And in the interest of time, I'll just put the rest on SharePoint. Thank you.

404
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:21,236
Council member Tiffany Thomas. Thank you. Thank you.

405
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:25,184
Director, the number around the bandit signs, does that include

406
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:27,990
the solid? Excuse me? The hotspot team,

407
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,296
their work in districts, do they contribute to this 45,000 or

408
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:35,848
is this your team exclusively? No, this was our team.

409
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:39,572
Wow. So this number could actually be higher in terms of like, collective effort?

410
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:41,050
Possibly, yes.

411
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,348
Council Member Michael Kubosh. Thank you very much. Good to

412
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:50,060
see you. Reggie Harris. I guess I've known you about 25

413
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,190
years. It's good to see you.

414
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,712
The electronic ticket writing process that we,

415
00:26:56,786 --> 00:26:59,888
years ago, we passed, I can't remember what it

416
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:03,248
was called, electronic ticket writing. Or are

417
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:06,976
you speaking of us moving from paper to N four?

418
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:11,040
N four. Are we using N four today? Oh, absolutely.

419
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,996
We're not the only ones. It's actually we've influenced the fire department to

420
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:17,924
come on to N four, as well as, I think, some aspects of public works.

421
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:21,876
So it's working very well for us. And what about parking and handicapped

422
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:23,080
parking spots?

423
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,068
Is that under your department writing? I was going to say I'm

424
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:33,828
going to defer to my colleague, Director Tina Pius, on that. Well, that's her

425
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:37,004
wheelhouse. The other thing is, what legislation are you

426
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:40,556
looking at that maybe the legislature could pass that

427
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:44,620
could help our Department of Neighborhoods to properly function

428
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,416
or function better in Houston? I think the

429
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:52,284
Legislature, the last time we actually submitted and supported legislation,

430
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:55,504
it was around higher fines so that there would be more

431
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:59,552
of a financial impact to

432
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:02,964
most property owners, most recalcitrant property owners in

433
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:05,872
many of our communities, Council Member Kubash,

434
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:09,120
are actually businesses that are just land grabbing and holding.

435
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,928
It's not the average everyday Houstonian. So that was something that we

436
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:17,044
were very supportive of. And I believe that that was legislation through Senator Miles's

437
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:21,028
office and I believe State Representative theory previously moved

438
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:24,616
for higher fines. Really, where the department is going to

439
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:28,124
be, I think most benefited is looking at our

440
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:31,516
Abatement budget. And Mayor Turner has been very gracious in

441
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:34,748
giving us additional money when we've asked for it so that we could be

442
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:37,980
more proactive on the Abatement side. But I think to

443
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,152
couple with that, again, the city has to be

444
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:44,496
more aggressive in recouping its money legally once we

445
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:47,904
put it out, because otherwise we're just putting good money after

446
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:51,140
bad and people rely on us to just do something they should be doing themselves.

447
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,424
Thank you for your service. Thank you, council Member Kubash. Administration. Regulatory affairs.

448
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:58,310
Budget presentation is Thursday at 230.

449
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,324
Council member or vice mayor. Pro TEM martha Castex

450
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:05,864
Tatum. Thank you. Chair Director Francis, what's the pay

451
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:09,064
for a code enforcement officer? Currently? The starting pay,

452
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:12,890
I believe, is what, 35? Yeah, it's about

453
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,280
35 for a trainee,

454
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,772
and you go up from there for one, two,

455
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:23,356
and a three. By the time you get to a three, you're looking at a

456
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:25,710
little over 2000 bi weekly pay.

457
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,810
And I think it's 35 with salary. Thousand dollars

458
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,320
and including benefits, is it not? And we just gave an increase, so it's probably

459
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,012
closer to 38 now, a hard fault increase.

460
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,696
So I know you all looking at us like that seems quite low, but that's

461
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:44,310
a recent increase on top of that. Yes.

462
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,524
What's the average payout in other cities? Are we

463
00:29:49,562 --> 00:29:53,268
competitive with other cities? Are we way below we're not. As a matter of

464
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:56,116
fact, what I can do, I'll take that as a homework assignment and send that

465
00:29:56,138 --> 00:29:59,684
to you on SharePoint. But what I can tell you is that we're not competitive

466
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:02,488
with other cities and we're not even competitive within the city.

467
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:05,612
We lose some of our code enforcement officers to Public Works,

468
00:30:05,746 --> 00:30:09,928
who also offer similar requirements

469
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:13,756
for higher pay for commercial buildings. What's the requirement? To be a code

470
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:17,336
enforcement officer. To be a code enforcement officer here in the state of Texas,

471
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:20,720
it is a state certified program that we pay for coming in.

472
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,364
I believe that program is one year. And then after that, they're actually moved

473
00:30:24,412 --> 00:30:27,920
into a code enforcement officer position. Now, Public Works

474
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,808
has different types of code enforcement officers that deal with different parts

475
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:35,636
of building codes, and that may have a different requirement, but this specific

476
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:38,836
requirement is state certified. Okay. And then

477
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:42,724
my other ask that if you could on page 19,

478
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:46,424
I like the accomplishments list. Is there

479
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:49,720
any way that that can be broken down per district?

480
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,916
And page 19, page 20.

481
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:59,512
I love all the statistics. Specifically,

482
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:02,750
what's helpful for me, if we can have those numbers

483
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,552
district broken down by district,

484
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:09,570
we can accommodate that. Okay. Thank you.

485
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,744
Vice Chair Edward Pollard. Thank you, Mayor Pro

486
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:17,088
Tim. And thank you all for your presentation. When we're talking about the

487
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:20,772
code enforcement officers, are there any ways

488
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:24,550
in which we can better utilize our Hot team

489
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,704
personnel to help with picture

490
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:34,584
taking, to help with any type of code enforcement or any

491
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:37,896
of that process? It seems like when our Hot teams are out there in

492
00:31:37,918 --> 00:31:41,572
the neighborhoods already servicing

493
00:31:41,636 --> 00:31:44,952
our residents, they're able to see things that

494
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:48,284
may be in violation or be able to take pictures to

495
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:51,756
send in. Is there a way

496
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:55,224
in which we could be more efficient and be able to utilize

497
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:58,792
them in a manner that will help your department more honestly?

498
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:02,272
Council Member the fact that you all have Hot teams in place is

499
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:06,304
helpful. We really don't need any additional help in the reporting area because

500
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:09,712
we get over 51,000 calls through three one one.

501
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:13,380
So we're aware we've got the reporting part down. What we do

502
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,932
have issues in, I think, as I've mentioned

503
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:20,388
previously, is that while the Hot teams can do a certain level of the

504
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:23,664
Abatement side of our work, the actual code enforcement

505
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:27,336
side is a specialized skill and profession that, unfortunately, you all are

506
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:30,584
not able to do. And so in order for us to do our job as

507
00:32:30,622 --> 00:32:34,340
under chapter ten, which is to go out and give the official notices

508
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,772
and then to write the citations, and hopefully the citations will be

509
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:41,468
yeah, can they help with that? Is there a

510
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:45,100
way what is the training entail? Like, how much training is involved in

511
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,396
that? Oh, well, sure. It's no. Problem? Well, first and

512
00:32:48,418 --> 00:32:51,936
foremost, I I think think what you're asking is, are they qualified to also be

513
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:56,172
code enforcement officers? What can we do to certify

514
00:32:56,236 --> 00:33:00,092
them as such so that you can have more personnel? They can't be certified

515
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:03,312
outside of the Department of Neighborhoods? They would have to be employees of this department,

516
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:06,896
because under the code into the city's charter, this department

517
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:09,860
is the one that actually works specifically for that area.

518
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,764
So if they become code enforcement officers, they'd have to become employees of this department

519
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:17,032
to do that. And right now, they are

520
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:20,632
employees of solid waste, I believe.

521
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:23,850
So through attempt service.

522
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,204
Yeah. It just seems like these are things that we should be able to be

523
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:32,424
more creative with when it comes to utilizing

524
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:36,110
personnel more efficiently to streamline the process.

525
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,690
So if we can have some type of overview on what,

526
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,864
in a hypothetical sense, could be done to utilize our code

527
00:33:44,902 --> 00:33:48,396
enforcement officers, to utilize our hot team to assist

528
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:50,660
with code enforcement, that would be helpful.

529
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,272
And I'd love to continue that conversation,

530
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:57,924
but just let me reiterate that the work your teams are already doing

531
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:02,216
is helpful. Yeah, I understand it may be helpful, but we

532
00:34:02,238 --> 00:34:07,768
want to find ways to have more enforcement without

533
00:34:07,854 --> 00:34:11,370
having to maybe go through the same traditional means of

534
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,396
having to hire more code enforcement officers. Or if you're

535
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:19,180
saying that the average pay is, like, 35,000 and that's below standard,

536
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,708
well, what can we do with the people who are already out there in the

537
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:22,990
neighborhoods to help?

538
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,796
Possibly we could look at an opportunity for you

539
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,320
to use some of your CDSF funds towards a particular team

540
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,696
for your area, but they would become employees of the Department of Neighborhoods that we

541
00:34:35,718 --> 00:34:38,930
would train, and then they could be specific to your area. That's an opportunity.

542
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,128
Okay, well, let's keep discussing it. Absolutely. All right. Thank you, council Member Abby

543
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:44,900
Cayman.

544
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:57,490
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. And apologies for my tardiness.

545
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,214
I, one wanted to first recognize and

546
00:35:01,252 --> 00:35:05,274
thank your team, and I know that Jack and Rhonda

547
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:09,390
specifically work within our district very heavily,

548
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,390
but to everyone I know, everyone's short staffed and things of that nature,

549
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,580
my staff may have already asked this. If not,

550
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,340
I'm asking every department this question. Okay.

551
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,174
Due to the financial constraints and

552
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:28,790
challenges that the city continues to face from

553
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,120
revenue caps, from other budgetary issues,

554
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,454
what are the needs that you are

555
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:40,394
not able to address right now in the department that you would like to see

556
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:44,026
address or feel that there is a need for? I think the

557
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:48,234
overwhelming theme at this point, council Member, is the funds

558
00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:50,830
put towards abatement and correction.

559
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,898
Realistically, for a city the size of Houston, 50 code enforcement

560
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:59,294
officers is abysmal, and we need

561
00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:02,526
more boots on the ground. But realistically, we're not going to get

562
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:06,526
an additional 200 people tomorrow. So I'm not banging that drum

563
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:10,606
today. However, the drum I will bang is that we have been very effective

564
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:14,258
in utilizing our Abatement funds to be able to correct the issues,

565
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:18,322
to lean those properties. And I think internally,

566
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:22,166
our ability to do that and have the funds there to correct those issues and

567
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:25,906
then also making sure that as a city, that we are foreclosing

568
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:29,018
on these liens and recouping that money may actually

569
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:32,442
create the revenue we need to bring in the additional bodies down the line.

570
00:36:32,496 --> 00:36:36,170
So that would be my response. Thank you. Thank you.

571
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,494
Thank you. We have seven total speakers,

572
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:43,134
public speakers signed up, only one virtual. So I'm not sure

573
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:45,582
how we're going to do with the in person one, but we'll start with Mr.

574
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:49,200
Doug Smith. Okay. Do we need to move?

575
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,170
Do you need us to move, Mr okay. Star six,

576
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,380
can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you.

577
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,742
Okay. Sorry about the sorry about the camera earlier.

578
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:03,666
I had turned it off and logged out and forgot

579
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:06,630
to turn it back on. But apologize.

580
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,742
This department probably is the one

581
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:14,438
I care about most because I care about my neighborhood so much.

582
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:18,006
And I am going to ask today for some council

583
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:21,994
member to submit an amendment to the budget to

584
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:25,930
add some employees, maybe several employees, maybe ten, or maybe 20

585
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,234
employees. When you look at the budget, nearly every other department is adding

586
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:33,454
employees, and this department is cutting full

587
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:36,910
time equivalents. And I don't understand, given the

588
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,986
results of their statistics on page 520,

589
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:45,362
why they're not doing this. It's almost

590
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:48,450
like we don't care about the neighborhoods, which I know is not the case.

591
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,306
And also, you talked about enforcing Abatement the

592
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:56,370
end of last year, you had $150,000,000 in unpaid liens.

593
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,066
That whole process for me, from having personally

594
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:03,654
lived through it this year with the junk trailer that you all know about,

595
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:07,466
is you don't have enough teeth in that process, and you

596
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:11,274
need to do something about that to improve it. So how

597
00:38:11,312 --> 00:38:13,100
would you address those two things?

598
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,320
Mr. Smith, was that question directed at me?

599
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:26,334
Yes or council members? Either or yes.

600
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:29,726
I certainly am going to address why are we not

601
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:33,618
asking? I would recommend

602
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:36,734
working with your council member to put an amendment through and identify

603
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,130
a funding source.

604
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,846
Okay. But I do want to ask her why she didn't ask for

605
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:47,510
more employees when every other department is getting substantial

606
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,950
FTEs.

607
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,110
Okay. So, Mr. Smith, I apologize.

608
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,740
Please repeat your last question, and I'm happy to answer it.

609
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,570
He wants to know why your FTEs drops. And I think in your presentation,

610
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,126
you answered it and you said that you were not competitive with salary. Until we

611
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:09,980
do something about that, we're not going to be able to attract them.

612
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,634
Am I correct? Yes. Okay. Yes, that will be correct. You limited three

613
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:17,562
positions in order to make those increases happen. Thank you, Mr.

614
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:21,530
Sims. Jason Oliver?

615
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,072
Yes. You may want to step

616
00:39:32,126 --> 00:39:34,490
back and go over where your team.

617
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,950
Okay, thank you. All right.

618
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,630
Thank you. So hi. Thank you.

619
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,652
I agree with Doug. The Department of Neighborhoods

620
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:55,744
is really important, and I hear year after year, right.

621
00:39:55,782 --> 00:39:59,088
We need hundreds of code enforcement officers. We need

622
00:39:59,254 --> 00:40:03,004
really hundreds of people doing the assistance office and literally,

623
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:07,184
like, everything. And so

624
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:11,044
I want to follow up on what what Doug asked in terms of how

625
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:14,504
do you decide what to ask for

626
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:18,024
in terms of asking for a smaller number instead

627
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:21,396
of asking for a larger budget for this fiscal

628
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:24,776
year and more personnel? And then

629
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:28,940
I'm looking at your budget for the kind of gang prevention salaries

630
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,164
is lower than any actuals from the past five years, and then

631
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:36,492
over 25% lower than, like, five years ago.

632
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:40,184
The actuals what does this significant decrease mean for service

633
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:43,424
delivery when there's a big need, particularly right now,

634
00:40:43,462 --> 00:40:47,456
for more youth programs? And then I just want to say we

635
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:51,376
have people who are showing up to speak just in

636
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:55,396
person. And I know that was trying to figure out how do people sign up

637
00:40:55,498 --> 00:40:58,960
if they show up to speak in person before the meeting,

638
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,956
who do they go to? They have a write in sheet over

639
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:07,528
there on the front right side of the room. Okay, perfect. That's good

640
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:10,136
to know. Thank you. Okay,

641
00:41:10,238 --> 00:41:13,464
so first question, Mr. Oliver. And actually,

642
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:17,048
it might be a little bit easier let's switch, if you don't mind. I don't

643
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:19,004
want to do that. Come on up, Mr. Oliver. I want to answer your question

644
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:22,680
directly, so while you're coming up, how we determine our priorities.

645
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,156
As a department director, it's my responsibility to,

646
00:41:26,178 --> 00:41:30,060
of course, look at the needs of my department, but also as

647
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,324
a I'm Team Don all day. Right.

648
00:41:33,442 --> 00:41:37,216
But I am also a part of Team City of Houston, so I

649
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:39,964
have to not only be familiar with what the needs are in my department,

650
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:42,220
but I have to be able to look at the broader landscape of where the

651
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,604
priorities of the city are, and I don't determine those. And so to your

652
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:49,700
point about why I've not asked for additional money

653
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:53,488
this year for additional code enforcement officers

654
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:57,384
is because, as you've mentioned before, every year I mentioned the need

655
00:41:57,422 --> 00:42:01,096
for that. And so I am confident that where we

656
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,660
are able to make those concessions within the overall picture of the budget,

657
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,324
the administration sees an opportunity. We keep a constant conversation

658
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:11,608
throughout the year about this. So this isn't the only time I bang the drum.

659
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:15,036
If those funds have become available and there are ways that we can do that

660
00:42:15,058 --> 00:42:18,636
to bring on additional people, then those are things that I've worked with

661
00:42:18,658 --> 00:42:22,412
the administration to do, which is why we actually have more positions

662
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:25,696
now. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, we are

663
00:42:25,718 --> 00:42:29,216
not able to be as competitive as we would like to be. And not

664
00:42:29,238 --> 00:42:33,024
to mention the fact that this is a particular area where most

665
00:42:33,062 --> 00:42:36,516
people kind of happen into it. So one of the things that I've talked

666
00:42:36,538 --> 00:42:40,276
to my team about is where we may need to up our recruitment game to

667
00:42:40,298 --> 00:42:43,732
let people know that this is another opportunity that they can look at as

668
00:42:43,786 --> 00:42:48,484
a paraprofessional opportunity. So it's not for lack

669
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:51,576
of caring about that, but it's also just the

670
00:42:51,598 --> 00:42:54,664
fact that when I look at the grand scheme of the city's needs,

671
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:58,600
I'm not saying our needs are not important, but I'm also realistic in what

672
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,088
I can ask for at what particular time, and as I'm setting

673
00:43:02,104 --> 00:43:05,436
the priorities for the office. As I mentioned before to Vice Mayor Pro TEM,

674
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:08,700
when we receive concerns from citizens like you and other people,

675
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,512
ultimately you don't care if someone

676
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:16,176
is inspected five or six times. What you want is I

677
00:43:16,198 --> 00:43:19,536
don't want to see it anymore. I want it corrected. So what is

678
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:23,040
more attainable at this time is to actually get more money towards

679
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:27,024
my budget to correct and for us to actually put more emphasis

680
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:30,960
on the city, recouping those funds so that I can have a long game approach

681
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,168
to bringing in more revenue to my department, to be able to bring in the

682
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:37,450
people that I need based on revenue that's not available now.

683
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,480
Thank you. Thank you. Your time has expired,

684
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,010
and then it comes back.

685
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,684
I don't think you'll find of the 23 departments that will present any

686
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:52,670
department that says they have more than enough money to do the proper

687
00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:01,048
job that they were signed up to do. Aris Brown vicky

Blanding Hi.

690
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,364
Good afternoon. Yeah, I don't have to hit mute.

691
00:44:18,412 --> 00:44:22,176
Six star six. Okay. The Office of New Americans has

692
00:44:22,198 --> 00:44:25,164
a very small budget. We've all established,

693
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:29,296
and you've talked about how hard you're working with little staff and

694
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:33,060
not enough compensation. I think we can do better. City of Houston,

695
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,156
what needs have you seen for immigrant communities during the pandemic that

696
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:40,100
more resources could help you all address? Wow. So,

697
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,608
needless to say, I think that we've seen an increase in needs,

698
00:44:43,694 --> 00:44:47,784
especially with Title 42 and the Biden administration looking at

699
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:51,752
a review of that. We are facing up to maybe 15,000

700
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:54,936
migrants possibly crossing the border. So what

701
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,904
we have been able to do with the Office of New Americans and immigrant communities,

702
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:02,680
we have great relationships with our nonprofit partners who actually facilitate

703
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,636
a lot of the programming that we're able to do. Needless to say,

704
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:10,272
to help corroborate what you mentioned earlier, we could definitely always

705
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:13,904
use additional staff, but what we're doing right now is really just trying

706
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:17,456
to use our nonprofit partnerships as a force multiplier to

707
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:20,390
meet the needs of our immigrant community. And right now,

708
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,644
that is the biggest and most pressing issue that we have before us right now.

709
00:45:24,842 --> 00:45:28,660
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Blinding. Joe. Rochelle,

710
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,130
did I pronounce that correctly? You did. Thank you.

711
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,196
Hi. Thank you for your presentation. I very much appreciate

712
00:45:38,228 --> 00:45:42,088
it. Thank you. Following on what Council Member Acorn said,

713
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:45,676
you spoke about turnover. Yes. So how do you plan to

714
00:45:45,698 --> 00:45:48,860
address the turnover and keep the people that you already have?

715
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:52,072
Since I understand that we don't have competitive salary,

716
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:55,356
and you had mentioned too, about how are people too

717
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:59,188
hot when they're out there, what are those different things? How do you prevent,

718
00:45:59,304 --> 00:46:02,624
try and keep the people that you already have? Well, one of the things that

719
00:46:02,662 --> 00:46:06,464
is always essential for me as a director is to always tell people thank you.

720
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:10,504
That goes a long way. And public servants don't always feel appreciated

721
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:14,640
for what they do. So we definitely want to make sure that they feel appreciated

722
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,516
and not overlooked day to day. More practically, what we have been able

723
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:21,956
to do is, as Mr. Sims, my assistant director,

724
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:25,572
mentioned earlier, we have been able to use some of our vacancies

725
00:46:25,636 --> 00:46:29,016
to move forward in some promotion opportunities. Because at

726
00:46:29,038 --> 00:46:32,556
this point, looking at what we're dealing with collectively as

727
00:46:32,578 --> 00:46:36,108
a country coupled with inflation, my mind has turned more towards

728
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:39,612
retention because I have amazing staff and

729
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:43,180
invaluable people. So we're looking at different

730
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,732
ways to reward those individuals who are already

731
00:46:46,786 --> 00:46:50,396
doing the job of two people or more. And that's

732
00:46:50,428 --> 00:46:53,596
what we're planning to do, as well as look at another way as a department,

733
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:57,172
we could be stronger on recruiting people to this profession. Thank you.

734
00:46:57,226 --> 00:47:00,052
Let me see. Thank you, Ms. Grochell. Mr.

735
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:01,590
Butler. You're welcome,

736
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,026
Director. Hi. Good afternoon. Hi. My name is Broderick Butler. I'm from

737
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:17,694
northeast Houston. And because of the time, I'm just going to

738
00:47:17,732 --> 00:47:21,150
sort of get to it. I'm going to read my questions and

739
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,794
the three minutes that I have, and I'll let the director 1 minute. Yes.

740
00:47:24,932 --> 00:47:28,274
Sorry. So basically, you have a backlog of

741
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:32,414
cases, yes or no? You've clarified vacancies

742
00:47:32,462 --> 00:47:35,906
were due to the high turnover rate, not resignations. So how

743
00:47:35,928 --> 00:47:39,266
are you able to complete your goal without putting a burden on remaining

744
00:47:39,298 --> 00:47:43,234
employees? Would more inspectors be assigned to specific designated

745
00:47:43,282 --> 00:47:47,026
areas, such as Council Member Tatum suggested, instead of rotating

746
00:47:47,058 --> 00:47:50,466
them be better due to your high number of turnover? It was pointed

747
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:54,154
out to me that it appears this is an all hands on deck situation at

748
00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:58,026
dawn. Has senior management staff considered interacting with the

749
00:47:58,048 --> 00:48:02,074
public? And those are the questions that I have, because the

750
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:05,566
way this is set up, it looks like a potential failure. I don't think that

751
00:48:05,588 --> 00:48:09,294
they will fail, but it is set up to where

752
00:48:09,412 --> 00:48:12,766
if you don't have enough to get the job done at the end

753
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:16,980
of the day, regardless, it puts you in a very difficult situation,

754
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:21,502
Mr. Butler. So we have backlog of cases,

755
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:24,020
more inspectors, and interaction with public.

756
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,938
Got it. So no problem. Thank you so much. Do we

757
00:48:27,944 --> 00:48:31,478
have a backlog in our cases? Actually, we are current, according to

758
00:48:31,484 --> 00:48:35,414
the mayor's dashboard, I believe, at 90 some

759
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:39,378
odd percent in terms of our performance measures and meeting the first inspection.

760
00:48:39,554 --> 00:48:43,202
So because we don't have enough people, we do have a backlog

761
00:48:43,266 --> 00:48:46,714
of our Abatement cases. So once we've inspected and go back

762
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:49,994
out, then we definitely have a backlog there. How are we going to deal

763
00:48:50,032 --> 00:48:53,466
with that? I'm going to utilize my current budget to spend what needs to be

764
00:48:53,488 --> 00:48:56,542
spent to correct it and ask for additional funds if they are available.

765
00:48:56,676 --> 00:49:00,234
When you mentioned before, vacancies are due high to turnover rates

766
00:49:00,282 --> 00:49:03,374
and not resignations. Yes, turnover is because people have

767
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:07,066
been kind of coming in and going back out, and this is not something that

768
00:49:07,108 --> 00:49:09,922
is particular to the Department of Neighborhoods currently.

769
00:49:09,976 --> 00:49:14,126
Our country is dealing with a great resignation where people are looking for different opportunities

770
00:49:14,238 --> 00:49:17,614
with more flexibility that, quite frankly, this particular role cannot

771
00:49:17,662 --> 00:49:21,206
offer. When you're looking at how do we complete our

772
00:49:21,228 --> 00:49:24,914
goals without putting a burden on remaining employees, we absolutely cannot

773
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,054
complete our goals without putting an additional burden on everybody,

774
00:49:28,172 --> 00:49:31,926
and that includes me. So all of us are working several positions so that

775
00:49:31,948 --> 00:49:35,274
we can accomplish what we're needing to accomplish. And that's why I love

776
00:49:35,312 --> 00:49:38,474
my team, because they do it from a great place and a love of community.

777
00:49:38,592 --> 00:49:42,646
They're very flexible, and they do the extra that is required. Would Morris inspectors

778
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:47,146
be assigned to specific designated areas? Absolutely. If I had the inspectors

779
00:49:47,178 --> 00:49:51,034
that I would ideally like to have, every area, every district, every neighborhood

780
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:54,286
would have a specific team. But because I do not, then we have to put

781
00:49:54,308 --> 00:49:58,526
them where the need is greatest, and we have to rotate them as necessary.

782
00:49:58,638 --> 00:50:02,526
It is an all hands on deck situation. Senior management staff

783
00:50:02,558 --> 00:50:06,066
is always interacting with the public, and if you have

784
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:08,690
not seen us enough, let me know, and I will come and see you myself.

785
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,386
Personally, however, it's always an on hands on deck

786
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:15,766
situation with Don. But what I'm happy to report is that we

787
00:50:15,788 --> 00:50:18,918
put all hands, feet, fingers, and toes in the work that we need to

788
00:50:18,924 --> 00:50:22,634
get done. Thank you. With all due respect, though, I unfortunately do not

789
00:50:22,672 --> 00:50:26,026
see that in my community as I speak to citizens as

790
00:50:26,048 --> 00:50:29,370
we go about our daily business. But I always

791
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,682
hope that one people can do better. Thank you.

792
00:50:32,816 --> 00:50:35,706
Thank you so much. And I invite you to visit with me at your leisure

793
00:50:35,738 --> 00:50:38,800
so we can talk about your specific issues. In what area?

794
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,398
Northeast Houston. Cynical at 77016.

795
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:45,250
Thank you so much. Ms. Melissa Martinez.

796
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,700
Hi, how are you? Good afternoon, everyone.

797
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:04,044
Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions

798
00:51:04,242 --> 00:51:07,864
I'm interested in overall, just on accessibility,

799
00:51:07,912 --> 00:51:11,436
on how to make the Neighborhoods grants more accessible, and who has

800
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:14,904
the authority to change the nonprofit eligibility requirement for neighborhood

801
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:18,624
grants? So that's my first, and then I have a second. Why do the

802
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:22,576
neighborhood grants operate on a reimbursement model? And who has the authority to

803
00:51:22,598 --> 00:51:26,224
change that as well? By requiring people to pay out of pocket. It significantly limits

804
00:51:26,272 --> 00:51:30,336
the applicant pool. And I want to add more context to that, that for folks

805
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:32,020
in communities.

806
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,896
Not everyone has the same background, whether it's academic or salary

807
00:51:38,928 --> 00:51:42,744
wise, to be able who want to create change of a project

808
00:51:42,862 --> 00:51:46,216
within their own district. And that

809
00:51:46,238 --> 00:51:49,348
is why I'm interested in with these questions on how we can invest in our

810
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:52,636
community members to have the ability to create change in their

811
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:56,190
own backyards and not just in other

812
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,190
proposals for more.

813
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,708
To me, that is public safety. Okay, that's a fair question.

814
00:52:03,794 --> 00:52:07,516
So the requirements around neighborhood matching grants,

815
00:52:07,548 --> 00:52:10,576
at one point in time prior to my coming on as director, there was a

816
00:52:10,598 --> 00:52:14,204
specific pool of money that was given to the department to actually deliver

817
00:52:14,252 --> 00:52:17,920
this program. As I understand it, it's always been a reimbursable program

818
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:21,524
where we're matching funds that are coming in from the community. I do

819
00:52:21,562 --> 00:52:25,136
understand your concern about that not being as accessible for some individuals.

820
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:28,368
However, what I found is that when people have teeth in the game, they tend

821
00:52:28,384 --> 00:52:32,232
to be a little bit better about maintaining and organizing and actually

822
00:52:32,286 --> 00:52:36,520
keeping up those beautification processes. The other part is that because now

823
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,784
we don't currently have that pot of money, what we do to keep

824
00:52:39,822 --> 00:52:43,644
the program going is we assist the council members offices, which is

825
00:52:43,682 --> 00:52:46,796
the source of funding. So the source of funding for our

826
00:52:46,818 --> 00:52:49,992
matching grant program now comes from the council district service funds.

827
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:53,136
The council members choose the projects that they would like to or can

828
00:52:53,158 --> 00:52:56,496
afford to actually fund for

829
00:52:56,518 --> 00:53:00,210
that year. And because of the fact that these are

830
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,944
taxpayer dollars, there's a specific way that we have to actually deal

831
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:08,076
with taxpayer dollars, which means we can't give that out to individuals.

832
00:53:08,108 --> 00:53:11,364
It would have to be the nonprofit protections that are offered, which is the reason

833
00:53:11,402 --> 00:53:15,168
why it is specific to 501 C, three S in receiving the money. So we're

834
00:53:15,184 --> 00:53:18,836
not trying to make it extra difficult, but legally, we have certain parameters we

835
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:21,576
have to follow as a city if we're going to put taxpayer dollars towards a

836
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:24,410
specific project. So I hope that answers your question.

837
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,930
Thank you. Question thank you.

838
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,180
No, ma'am, your time has expired. Thank you. You can submit the question

839
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,604
in writing, and we will have the

840
00:53:36,642 --> 00:53:39,836
ability to have your council member get back in

841
00:53:39,858 --> 00:53:43,404
touch with you. Okay. So before we

842
00:53:43,442 --> 00:53:47,164
dismiss Vice Mayor Pro TEM martha Castex Tatum.

843
00:53:47,212 --> 00:53:50,636
Yes. I just have one more question. Do we have any code enforcement officers

844
00:53:50,668 --> 00:53:54,464
that work on weekends? No. Okay.

845
00:53:54,582 --> 00:53:57,808
Thank you. Thank you. But that's a great idea. One, we've been

846
00:53:57,814 --> 00:54:01,888
working for it, and as you said

847
00:54:02,054 --> 00:54:05,616
to your people thank you. Thank you to you and Director Sims and all

848
00:54:05,638 --> 00:54:09,332
your staff. So thank you. Thank you, Chair. And another reminder,

849
00:54:09,476 --> 00:54:13,032
public, if you have questions, you can always locate those

850
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:16,664
into your council members and then you'll have the ability for them

851
00:54:16,702 --> 00:54:20,390
to provide the additional response back to you. So thank you. Thank you.
