00:04.410 --> 00:08.218
My name is David Robinson. I'm the council member who's chairing

00:08.234 --> 00:12.042
this meeting. It's a Budget and Fiscal Affairs committee meeting. It is Thursday,

00:12.106 --> 00:15.294
May 19, 2022, and it

00:15.332 --> 00:18.698
is just past 09:00. A.m. Nine three and I call this meeting

00:18.714 --> 00:22.266
to order and would like to welcome all council members and staff

00:22.458 --> 00:26.082
who are here in attendance, and we will recognize

00:26.146 --> 00:29.554
them very shortly. But first, I wanted to mention that this budget

00:29.602 --> 00:33.398
workshop procedures will follow.

00:33.484 --> 00:37.126
All budget workshops will be conducted in person, and our

00:37.148 --> 00:41.754
public speakers have the option to comment in person or virtually 48

00:41.792 --> 00:45.590
hours prior to the start of a workshop. All presentation materials

00:45.670 --> 00:49.402
are uploaded to SharePoint and hard copies delivered to each

00:49.456 --> 00:52.942
council office. All departments have been directed to provide

00:52.996 --> 00:56.782
written responses within 48 hours of the conclusion of their

00:56.836 --> 01:00.574
presentation to any questions posted by council members to

01:00.612 --> 01:03.962
SharePoint the budget workshop schedule

01:04.026 --> 01:07.278
is posted on the BFA website. Questions from council

01:07.294 --> 01:10.414
members can be uploaded at any time during the budget workshop

01:10.462 --> 01:14.494
process, the earlier the better, but allowing all the departments

01:14.542 --> 01:17.862
plenty of time to respond to those questions.

01:17.996 --> 01:21.286
All public speakers should be signed in to speak. If you

01:21.308 --> 01:24.390
have not signed up, please sign in at the front table.

01:24.730 --> 01:28.338
My staff here today includes staff

01:28.434 --> 01:32.390
from our Mayor Pro TEM with Chief of Staff

01:32.470 --> 01:35.706
Jessica Beamer, as well as Carolina here, who will be

01:35.728 --> 01:40.282
monitoring the Speaker's list for the fiscal year 2023

01:40.336 --> 01:43.706
budget amendment. Their template has been uploaded

01:43.738 --> 01:47.162
and is available for council members on the SharePoint Budget

01:47.226 --> 01:50.746
Workspace. And Mayor Turner has sent out a memo

01:50.778 --> 01:54.542
to all council members and council offices to ensure productive

01:54.606 --> 01:58.686
discussions on the fiscal year 2023 proposed budget

01:58.798 --> 02:02.238
only operation, budget related amendments will be considered.

02:02.334 --> 02:05.554
Policy amendments should not be submitted and will be ruled

02:05.602 --> 02:09.334
out of order. And please see the Mayor's memo for

02:09.372 --> 02:12.822
additional guidelines. Amendments are

02:12.876 --> 02:16.342
due on Wednesday, May 25, at the end of Business.

02:16.476 --> 02:19.914
And today on our agenda, we will hear from

02:20.112 --> 02:24.182
the Controller with a special BFA Trends

02:24.246 --> 02:27.930
report. We'll hear also from the Controller's office.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.162
We'll hear from the Mayor's office, from Legal,

02:31.306 --> 02:34.554
from Planning, from City Council

02:34.682 --> 02:38.282
and our office collectively,

02:38.346 --> 02:41.822
as well as the Administrative and Regulatory Affairs Group

02:41.956 --> 02:45.634
and Municipal courts. Today is our final day of

02:45.672 --> 02:48.510
the budget workshops. And as a reminder,

02:48.670 --> 02:52.674
these virtual meeting rules, the only people attending virtually are

02:52.712 --> 02:56.754
public speakers. We have seven virtual public speakers

02:56.802 --> 03:00.790
signed up for public comment to speak after the Houston

03:01.290 --> 03:05.046
the Municipal Courts presentation, and there are two

03:05.148 --> 03:09.270
in person speakers that will begin after the virtual public

03:09.340 --> 03:13.546
speakers. We'll get to the questions after the presentation and questions from council members

03:13.648 --> 03:17.174
have concluded. Let me take a moment to recognize my colleagues

03:17.222 --> 03:21.210
who are in the chamber. That's Dr. Carolyn Evans Shabbaz

03:21.370 --> 03:25.306
of district D, the district of destination, as well as council member

03:25.338 --> 03:29.200
Amy Peck from district A. We have staff members

03:29.810 --> 03:32.400
represented from District C,

03:33.110 --> 03:36.866
from District G, from district H.

03:37.048 --> 03:40.642
We have representatives from the Vice Mayor Pro Tems office

03:40.696 --> 03:44.254
in District K from District F on the West

03:44.302 --> 03:48.500
Side, as well as the at large positions four and five

03:48.870 --> 03:51.910
and representing the AtLarge Two office.

03:51.980 --> 03:55.366
I too am here and with that Controller, it's great to see

03:55.388 --> 03:59.350
you this morning. Welcome to the Chamber and sir, the floor is yours.

04:00.090 --> 04:03.626
Thank you. Council members and staff, I'm pleased to present the

04:03.648 --> 04:06.780
Trends Report for the fiscal year ending 2023.

04:07.310 --> 04:11.030
At the time of this report, the economy is showing hopeful progress

04:11.110 --> 04:14.666
in the recovery from COVID-19 Pandemic. The infusion

04:14.698 --> 04:18.746
of more than 5 trillion in federal stimulus nationwide has contributed

04:18.778 --> 04:22.286
to the generous robust sales tax receipt seen since the

04:22.308 --> 04:26.174
passage of COVID relief legislation in Houston.

04:26.222 --> 04:29.646
The receipt of more than 1 billion in response and recovery funding has buoyed

04:29.678 --> 04:33.518
the otherwise bleak fiscal outlook seen pre pandemic.

04:33.694 --> 04:37.010
We project the increases seen in several revenue sources,

04:37.090 --> 04:39.698
namely sales tax, to be temporary.

04:39.874 --> 04:43.638
The FY 23 proposed budget uses 160,000,000

04:43.724 --> 04:47.486
in American Rescue Plan funding to address a habitual

04:47.538 --> 04:51.590
budget deficit. This deficit would have required drastic

04:51.750 --> 04:55.446
expenditure reductions citywide absent the receipt of federal recovery

04:55.478 --> 04:59.190
funding. So this structural deficit existed

04:59.270 --> 05:02.986
before COVID and will exist after ARPA funds are expended.

05:03.098 --> 05:06.960
The decisions we make after and during this fiscal year,

05:07.490 --> 05:11.006
while we have the benefit of the federal dollars, will determine the size of that

05:11.028 --> 05:14.546
deficit in the future. The more than 606,000,000

05:14.648 --> 05:18.254
made available through ARPA funding provides the City with a golden

05:18.302 --> 05:21.938
opportunity to make tangible progress towards reducing the

05:21.944 --> 05:25.630
structural deficit. The Controller's Office encourages

05:25.710 --> 05:28.946
the Administration and Council to address the City's long term

05:28.978 --> 05:32.534
financial liabilities with these funds and avoid adding large

05:32.572 --> 05:36.038
recurring expenditures for which city leadership will have little means to pay in

05:36.044 --> 05:39.594
the future. With that, I'm pleased to present the trends report for

05:39.632 --> 05:42.570
FY 23. Next slide.

05:43.950 --> 05:47.738
We'll move on to the next slide. This is

05:47.744 --> 05:51.470
just a graph summary of all the different financials

05:52.530 --> 05:55.774
and on this slide, General Fund revenues. It shows

05:55.812 --> 05:59.390
the Controller's Office General Fund FY 22 projections,

05:59.810 --> 06:03.294
our FY 23 Trends projections and the historical

06:03.342 --> 06:07.010
information back to FY 18. Next slide.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.780
In the General Fund revenues,

06:14.400 --> 06:18.524
the Controller's Office is projecting an increase in our General Fund revenue projection

06:18.572 --> 06:22.368
by 15.8 million, or 0.6

06:22.534 --> 06:25.884
tenths of a percent from our March FY 22 Mofar

06:25.932 --> 06:29.652
projection. The major drivers of our projected increases are property

06:29.706 --> 06:33.536
tax and intergovernmental revenues. This amount includes

06:33.568 --> 06:37.332
the ARPA funds and we've seen strong sales tax

06:37.386 --> 06:41.460
numbers month over month. But we believe this is the temporary

06:42.060 --> 06:46.360
cumulative result of a low interest rate environment,

06:46.700 --> 06:50.532
business continuing to return to post COVID routines,

06:50.676 --> 06:54.356
and lastly, the infusion of more than 5 trillion in federal

06:54.388 --> 06:57.900
stimulus into the national economy. Next slide.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.608
Property tax revenue. The property tax revenue for FY 23 is expected

07:03.624 --> 07:07.230
to be 3.97% higher than FY 22.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.200
This amount could be higher as terse payments have yet to be paid out.

07:11.350 --> 07:14.656
Property tax revenue continues to be an area of interest for our

07:14.678 --> 07:18.476
office as we monitor the effects of Senate Bill Two and Proposition One revenue

07:18.508 --> 07:22.468
cap. The city is still subject to the provisions of Senate Bill Two and

07:22.474 --> 07:26.064
we believe the variable in Prop One's methodology, the Growth

07:26.112 --> 07:30.020
Index, has the potential to trigger SB Two for the first time.

07:30.170 --> 07:33.384
So, as of today, both prop One and SB Two apply to the city.

07:33.422 --> 07:37.064
But Prop One has been far more restrictive over time and that might

07:37.102 --> 07:42.264
change. Next slide the

07:42.302 --> 07:45.932
Taxable Values based on a preliminary expected taxable value

07:45.986 --> 07:51.068
from the three appraisal districts, the Controller's office projects a 9.42%

07:51.154 --> 07:54.300
increase in taxable values. The final

07:54.370 --> 07:57.884
taxable values are subject to change and will be finalized when the certified

07:57.932 --> 08:01.600
roles are provided to the City. Next slide

08:04.020 --> 08:07.856
taxable value by Type residential properties make

08:07.878 --> 08:11.816
up 53.4% of taxable values and commercial properties

08:11.868 --> 08:14.816
make up 43.8%. Collectively,

08:14.848 --> 08:18.224
the two property types make up 97.2% of taxable

08:18.272 --> 08:22.736
values and as you can see, residential and commercial values

08:22.928 --> 08:26.024
last were even in FY 16. Since then

08:26.062 --> 08:29.816
we've seen the disparity between the two widen and we believe this is

08:29.838 --> 08:33.080
a result of the more aggressive appraisal protests by commercial property

08:33.150 --> 08:37.100
owners and also the significant residential development.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.860
Next slide sales

08:42.930 --> 08:46.776
Tax FY 23 sales tax revenue is projected to increase by

08:46.818 --> 08:50.752
4.76% from our forecast FY 22 sales

08:50.806 --> 08:54.592
tax projection. This decrease is an anticipated result

08:54.646 --> 08:58.690
of the effect of federal stimulus tapering off.

09:03.080 --> 09:09.082
Next slide the

09:09.136 --> 09:13.094
Property Tax Rate this chart shows historical property tax rates. The FY

09:13.142 --> 09:17.134
23 rate is the same as the FY 22s rate but will be updated once

09:17.172 --> 09:20.506
the Prop One calculation is finalized and when the appraisal

09:20.538 --> 09:24.014
district certified roles are made available. It is worth

09:24.052 --> 09:27.374
noting that FY 17 was the first year the city had to decrease

09:27.422 --> 09:30.420
its tax rate to maintain compliance with Prop One.

09:31.510 --> 09:35.778
Next slide total

09:35.864 --> 09:39.854
Franchise Revenue total franchise revenue is projected decreased

09:39.902 --> 09:42.440
by 2.2% from FY 22.

09:43.130 --> 09:46.342
Total franchise revenue has been trending down in recent years.

09:46.476 --> 09:50.614
We believe it's a cumulative result of SB 1152

09:50.732 --> 09:54.262
and that's related to the telecom industries statewide

09:54.326 --> 09:57.622
as well as consumers moving away from landlines

09:57.686 --> 10:01.626
and cutting the cord I e. Digital streaming instead of

10:01.648 --> 10:08.026
cable and satellite. Next slide municipal

10:08.058 --> 10:11.706
Court Revenue municipal courts fines and forfeits are expected to decrease

10:11.738 --> 10:16.218
by 6% for FY 23 based on an expected decrease in collections,

10:16.394 --> 10:19.630
moving violations fees and court operations revenue.

10:19.790 --> 10:23.746
We've seen municipal courts continue to trend down over the years and obviously COVID had

10:23.768 --> 10:28.130
a pretty outsized effect on those revenues. Next slide

10:29.670 --> 10:33.302
General Fund Expenditure Budget the FY 23 General

10:33.356 --> 10:37.142
Fund total expenditure budget is expected to increase by 3.8%

10:37.196 --> 10:40.754
over FY 22 projected expenditures. That's an increase

10:40.802 --> 10:44.566
of 101.7 million. The use of

10:44.588 --> 10:47.918
ARPA funds is the equivalent to which use of non recurring

10:47.954 --> 10:52.230
revenue source that adds pressure to the city's structurally imbalanced budget.

10:52.390 --> 10:55.754
ARPA funds must be leveraged to address the city's structural

10:55.802 --> 10:59.178
deficit and some of its long term liabilities.

10:59.354 --> 11:03.486
Instead, we're adding recurring costs for which we

11:03.668 --> 11:06.874
don't have recurring revenue to match beyond and into

11:06.932 --> 11:11.566
the future. So these recurring costs will exacerbate

11:11.678 --> 11:15.570
an already stressed, structurally imbalanced budget.

11:17.670 --> 11:21.462
Next slide. Here you can just see the general

11:21.516 --> 11:23.240
fund by percentage and function.

11:25.370 --> 11:28.882
Public safety, as you all know, is a lion's share of the budget

11:28.946 --> 11:31.350
as a percentage. And you can see the other breakdowns.

11:32.890 --> 11:37.882
Next slide. The cash

11:37.936 --> 11:41.434
versus fund balance. The unassigned fund balance is

11:41.472 --> 11:44.938
expected to increase by 18.8 million in FY 22

11:45.104 --> 11:48.862
and decrease by 58.8 million in FY 23.

11:48.996 --> 11:52.394
And the projected unassigned fund balance for fiscal

11:52.442 --> 11:55.774
year 2022 is 300 million and for 2023

11:55.812 --> 11:59.810
is 241,000,000. Next slide,

12:02.470 --> 12:06.014
the seven and a half percent fund balance requirement. The FY

12:06.062 --> 12:09.826
projected ending fund balance is expected to be 68 million above the

12:09.848 --> 12:13.990
required seven and a half percent less debt service and PAYGO.

12:14.730 --> 12:18.406
This represents a fund balance of 10.4% above the

12:18.428 --> 12:22.722
required seven and a half percent. This is primarily

12:22.786 --> 12:26.298
a result of the one time financing sources offered through American

12:26.384 --> 12:30.006
Rescue Plan and the 606,000,000 in funding.

12:30.198 --> 12:33.306
But the good news is we do have a pretty substantial fund balance at

12:33.328 --> 12:36.794
this point in time. Moving on,

12:36.992 --> 12:40.986
page 16. Next slide houston

12:41.018 --> 12:44.394
Airport system has

12:44.442 --> 12:48.234
revenue was significantly impacted by the Pandemic,

12:48.282 --> 12:52.194
but our projections for FY 23 demonstrate a rebound as more people begin

12:52.232 --> 12:55.646
to travel by air again, as borders open and foreign

12:55.678 --> 12:59.102
countries relax COVID regulations, we'll continue to see more international

12:59.166 --> 13:03.474
routes come back online. We have yet to see international passenger

13:03.522 --> 13:06.978
numbers return to pre Pandemic levels and ARPA

13:06.994 --> 13:10.054
funds are considered grant dollars and are not included in these

13:10.092 --> 13:11.270
revenue projections.

13:13.630 --> 13:14.730
Next slide,

13:22.940 --> 13:26.996
aviation revenues. The COVID-19 impact on airline travel has resulted

13:27.028 --> 13:30.788
in 370,000,000,000 lost in airline revenue worldwide

13:30.964 --> 13:34.924
and at one point air traffic was down nearly 70%.

13:35.122 --> 13:38.012
So you can see the impact that it's had. But again,

13:38.146 --> 13:41.748
things are starting to rebound with the exception of the international

13:41.864 --> 13:46.080
and some of the business travel. Next slide.

13:48.180 --> 13:52.124
Aviation expenses. Expenditures are up primarily due to personnel

13:52.172 --> 13:55.732
expenditures increasing by 6.3 million or 5.5%

13:55.786 --> 13:59.200
from FY 22. I would caution

13:59.280 --> 14:02.964
Council on this that we need to be vigilant about this very

14:03.082 --> 14:06.640
item expenditures in his going forward,

14:06.730 --> 14:09.972
especially if we do not see that air traffic,

14:10.116 --> 14:14.596
both business and international travel, returning to pre Pandemic

14:14.628 --> 14:18.004
levels and again continue at a growth rate that's

14:18.052 --> 14:21.756
consistent historically. Other services and charges are up

14:21.778 --> 14:25.116
by 4% due to contractual services and interfund police and

14:25.138 --> 14:31.944
fire services. Next slide convention

14:31.992 --> 14:35.340
entertainment revenue and expenses. We anticipate CNE

14:35.420 --> 14:38.796
will continue to see an upward trend in the recovery from the Pandemic.

14:38.828 --> 14:42.604
In FY 23, revenues are expected to increase

14:42.652 --> 14:46.128
by 20.6% or 17.4 million, for a

14:46.134 --> 14:49.236
total of 102,000,000. Expenditures are

14:49.258 --> 14:53.220
expected to increase by 18.6%, or 17.5 million,

14:53.290 --> 14:57.024
for a total of 111.9 million. The FY

14:57.072 --> 15:00.696
23 deficit of 9.9 million ultimately will result in

15:00.718 --> 15:04.264
a decrease in the ending total net position, so they will draw that from fund

15:04.302 --> 15:08.216
balance. But the hope is that in the future things continue.

15:08.318 --> 15:12.008
I know Council member, you've been involved there and seen the

15:12.014 --> 15:15.596
struggle that they've been dealing with, but we're hopeful that things return and they

15:15.618 --> 15:19.020
can build up fund balance in the future with future revenue.

15:20.720 --> 15:25.280
Next slide convention and entertainment revenues.

15:25.860 --> 15:29.548
As you know, CNE was significantly impacted.

15:29.724 --> 15:33.452
Large gatherings and events were canceled due to COVID.

15:33.596 --> 15:36.648
So the primary CNE revenue is hotel

15:36.684 --> 15:40.448
occupancy tax, which is reported as non operating revenue.

15:40.624 --> 15:44.116
Hotel tax collections are projected to increase by 15.8

15:44.138 --> 15:47.716
million, or 20.5% when compared to FY 22,

15:47.898 --> 15:51.716
and this shows that travelers are largely returning to pre

15:51.738 --> 15:55.236
pandemic routines. CNE is also seeing a projected

15:55.268 --> 15:59.172
increase in operating revenues by 22.5%, or 1.7

15:59.246 --> 16:02.796
million. That's due to increases in parking revenue as

16:02.818 --> 16:06.856
a result of downtown area workers and commuters returning to pre pandemic

16:06.888 --> 16:09.980
routines. Next slide,

16:11.840 --> 16:15.056
CNE expenses. The CNE is projecting an increase of

16:15.078 --> 16:18.656
18.6 or 17.5 million in expenses when compared to

16:18.678 --> 16:22.032
FY 22. This increase is primarily a result

16:22.086 --> 16:25.776
of increased debt service payments, an increase in transfer to component

16:25.808 --> 16:28.932
units, namely a transfer of 10 million to Houston first to address

16:28.986 --> 16:33.060
their deficit. Next slide

16:34.120 --> 16:38.500
the combined utility System Revenue and expenses.

16:38.840 --> 16:42.584
US expenditures are projected to exceed revenues by 50.2

16:42.622 --> 16:46.084
million in FY 23, and that's primarily as a result of increased

16:46.132 --> 16:49.476
investment in sewer and wastewater systems. And that's what's

16:49.508 --> 16:53.256
legally obligated as part of the EPA's consent decree.

16:53.448 --> 16:57.068
As you recall, this agreement Stipulates 2 billion investment must be made in

16:57.074 --> 17:00.984
the next ten years. Our office is noting an increase in personnel

17:01.032 --> 17:04.264
cost, salary cost, as well as nearly 1.2 in performance

17:04.312 --> 17:07.330
based bonus for FY 23. So again,

17:07.780 --> 17:11.536
as we continue to see this recovery, we need to make sure, not just

17:11.558 --> 17:15.136
in our general fund, but also in our enterprise funds, that we are managing

17:15.168 --> 17:18.900
our expenses. Next slide

17:22.460 --> 17:25.976
combined Utility System Revenue The C US total revenue is

17:25.998 --> 17:29.944
expected to increase by 92.6 million, primarily due to increased

17:29.992 --> 17:33.516
water and sewer sales. However, these increases are

17:33.538 --> 17:37.336
offset by decreases in projected sales of scraps and other revenue and impact

17:37.368 --> 17:44.224
fees. Next Slide c

17:44.262 --> 17:47.788
us expenditures. C US total expenditures

17:47.884 --> 17:51.616
are expected to increase by 328.1 million and

17:51.638 --> 17:55.284
that's due to debt transfer to capital projects and

17:55.322 --> 17:59.184
maintenance costs. Changes in operating and maintenance expenses

17:59.232 --> 18:03.236
reflect increases in personnel expenses, largely due to

18:03.258 --> 18:07.368
pay for the increase in FTE headcount by 123

18:07.454 --> 18:09.210
in FY 23.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.440
Next slide.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.244
I think that's the end of the presentation, so happy to answer

18:20.282 --> 18:23.944
any questions. Thank you very much, Controller. I appreciate that and

18:24.142 --> 18:27.944
a number of very helpful observations. And while

18:27.982 --> 18:31.368
I might have a question or two, I wonder if there are any

18:31.454 --> 18:34.860
from the array of council members assembled,

18:35.840 --> 18:39.724
we do have four virtual we

18:39.762 --> 18:43.676
think there are two virtual public attendees online,

18:43.858 --> 18:46.030
and we may start with those.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.450
But before going to that, I want to point out that

18:51.300 --> 18:55.120
your points about the airport system and Houston first are

18:55.270 --> 18:59.340
particularly helpful, I think today for some of those extracurricular

18:59.420 --> 19:02.852
things that we really haven't seen too much of here. We did have a good

19:02.906 --> 19:06.324
report from the director of the airport system yesterday with

19:06.362 --> 19:09.680
his budget and there was some narrative and discussion

19:09.840 --> 19:13.136
about the surrounding overall capital

19:13.248 --> 19:16.660
campaigns investment that they're putting into the new facility.

19:16.740 --> 19:20.584
So appreciate your reminders on that. So with that,

19:20.622 --> 19:24.456
I believe we will go to the public speakers and we'll call first Miss Saba

19:24.488 --> 19:27.816
Blanding. Ms. Blanding, if you're

19:27.848 --> 19:30.990
there, please unmute by hitting star six.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.588
I think we see. I believe I'm unmuted. Can you all hear me?

19:34.674 --> 19:38.860
Yes. Good morning, Ms. Blanding. Oh, wonderful morning.

19:38.930 --> 19:41.810
How are you all doing today? Doing well, thank you.

19:42.900 --> 19:46.208
And I apologize. I was trying to finish a walk before you got to

19:46.214 --> 19:49.856
us, but you're like on top of it today, so I'm

19:49.888 --> 19:53.236
outside. Yeah, and it's a little hard to hear you, so if

19:53.258 --> 19:56.944
you can speak slowly and clearly,

19:56.992 --> 19:58.500
that would be very helpful.

20:00.040 --> 20:03.936
Absolutely. So I just wanted to take advantage of this new format

20:03.968 --> 20:07.576
and give you all a chance to brag on yourselves and ask what

20:07.598 --> 20:10.716
is the one thing you're most proud of Houston accomplishing in 2021?

20:10.718 --> 20:13.720
And especially for district council members,

20:13.790 --> 20:17.084
I'm just curious, especially for your district, specifically, what you're most

20:17.122 --> 20:20.572
proud of? Well, thank you for that nice

20:20.626 --> 20:24.456
question this morning from the Garden. I think I heard you say. I don't

20:24.488 --> 20:28.400
see any district council members jumping to

20:28.550 --> 20:32.576
respond. I know my big district. It's the at large city.

20:32.758 --> 20:36.556
Very proud of the diversity of our eleven

20:36.668 --> 20:40.444
distinct districts and the incredible nature

20:40.492 --> 20:43.424
of our communities and overlapping neighborhoods.

20:43.552 --> 20:47.204
Just makes me proud to be a part of everything going

20:47.242 --> 20:50.816
on in the city right now. Ms. Planning. How about you? What are you proud

20:50.848 --> 20:54.330
of? Me?

20:55.260 --> 20:56.010
Yeah.

20:58.620 --> 21:02.200
I really appreciated council member Plumber at

21:02.270 --> 21:05.464
her amendment adding the additional two MCOT teams.

21:05.512 --> 21:09.340
So anything we can do to invest in more

21:09.410 --> 21:13.036
preventative direct mental health care is always a win on

21:13.058 --> 21:16.460
my part. And I'm also loving the bike lanes you all are doing

21:16.530 --> 21:19.696
and always the Bayou expansion is amazing.

21:19.878 --> 21:22.848
It's a long list, so those are a top three,

21:23.014 --> 21:26.656
top of mind. Well, very good. Thank you very much for being here today and

21:26.678 --> 21:30.084
for your ongoing attendance here. Our next

21:30.122 --> 21:33.604
speaker is Mr. Jason Oliver joining us

21:33.642 --> 21:38.452
virtually. Mr. Oliver, if you can hit star six or

21:38.506 --> 21:39.510
speak now.

21:43.180 --> 21:46.260
Calling Jason Oliver. If you can unmute

21:46.340 --> 21:47.850
and join us online.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.810
Good morning. Thank you.

21:54.640 --> 21:58.392
I'm thinking about this presentation and I'm wondering,

21:58.456 --> 22:02.652
so the structural deficit is of course, something that comes

22:02.706 --> 22:06.608
up every year. If we get rid of

22:06.614 --> 22:07.810
the revenue cap,

22:11.860 --> 22:15.568
I think that's around 280 or so million.

22:15.654 --> 22:19.184
I'm wondering, will that kind of get us

22:19.222 --> 22:22.540
to a place of being able to

22:22.630 --> 22:26.048
fully fund some of these departments that we see are struggling,

22:26.144 --> 22:29.844
right? If we do, will that address some of the needs that we've seen

22:29.882 --> 22:33.124
over the past few days? And then also in terms

22:33.162 --> 22:36.932
of ARPA funds, where are you seeing some strong opportunities

22:36.996 --> 22:40.056
and candidates for investment that we may or may

22:40.078 --> 22:43.924
not be doing? I'm trying to figure out are we making those structural investments?

22:44.052 --> 22:47.448
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Oliver, for the question. The controller

22:47.544 --> 22:50.876
may have something he'd like to say. Here he is. Sure. Thank you for the

22:50.898 --> 22:54.844
question. The first part being able

22:54.882 --> 22:58.128
to repeal and again, I believe that would have to

22:58.134 --> 23:01.724
be through a voter referendum, the property revenue

23:01.772 --> 23:05.616
cap, prop One, rev cap that would

23:05.638 --> 23:09.204
go a long way towards eliminating the

23:09.322 --> 23:12.820
structural budget imbalance based on the current numbers.

23:12.890 --> 23:17.168
The challenge is we also have SB Two, the statewide

23:17.344 --> 23:21.284
rollback rate cap that we'd have to contend with.

23:21.482 --> 23:25.368
So it might not be as effective as

23:25.454 --> 23:28.490
possible. But I know that there has been discussion about that.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.344
One of the things that I've suggested in the past, having been

23:32.382 --> 23:36.044
here now for 19 years and remembering Mayor Bill

23:36.082 --> 23:40.060
White, he passed an amendment to lift the revenue cap

23:40.210 --> 23:43.624
for a specific purpose, primarily for public safety.

23:43.752 --> 23:47.468
And he was able to, again, through referendum,

23:47.644 --> 23:51.040
raise a $90 million cap for public safety.

23:51.940 --> 23:55.408
That could possibly be an interim step. And I know the administration has

23:55.494 --> 23:59.204
tossed that around in the past. To the

23:59.242 --> 24:02.624
second question, the structural budget imbalances

24:02.752 --> 24:06.356
existed before this administration, even as far back before the

24:06.378 --> 24:10.036
White administration, during the Brown administration. So the

24:10.058 --> 24:13.940
challenge is it keeps growing every year. And unfortunately,

24:14.100 --> 24:17.364
this particular year, because of all the federal

24:17.412 --> 24:21.032
money, it's going to grow substantially more, and that

24:21.086 --> 24:24.348
is only cumulative into the future. One of

24:24.354 --> 24:28.044
the things I've kind of said ad nauseam is the PFM report that

24:28.162 --> 24:31.932
the administration and council, you know, approved and and

24:31.986 --> 24:34.780
authored back in 2017.

24:35.120 --> 24:38.540
There are, you know, over 50 different items on there.

24:38.610 --> 24:42.704
And one of the things, in talking to the various consultant groups that

24:42.742 --> 24:46.224
we interact with, they said, this is a great

24:46.262 --> 24:49.696
plan, but you need someone to go out and implement it. And specifically in

24:49.718 --> 24:53.568
the consulting world, what they call PMO program management offices.

24:53.664 --> 24:56.820
And it takes dollars to implement a lot of these things.

24:56.890 --> 25:00.004
Well, we have wonderful employees at the city. We've been

25:00.042 --> 25:02.760
stretched thin. People are doing more with less.

25:02.830 --> 25:06.564
So to answer your question, one of my suggestions

25:06.612 --> 25:10.520
would be to take some of these federal dollars, invest them to

25:10.590 --> 25:14.536
implement program management offices, essentially consulting groups

25:14.568 --> 25:17.784
to go in and to implement these PFM

25:17.832 --> 25:21.432
recommendations. Because as you all recall, the cumulative

25:21.496 --> 25:25.752
effect of increased revenue and reduction in expenses

25:25.816 --> 25:29.648
per the report was around $300 million.

25:29.734 --> 25:33.600
So there's, I think, a lot of opportunities to spend this money

25:33.670 --> 25:37.516
in a way that it doesn't create a recurring expenditure

25:37.628 --> 25:40.980
in the future, but spend it to actually reduce those or

25:41.130 --> 25:44.484
create new revenue. Thank you very much,

25:44.522 --> 25:47.856
Controller. I think that's a very helpful response

25:47.888 --> 25:50.468
to Mr. Oliver. Thank you for your question, sir.

25:50.554 --> 25:54.628
And I do see one council member in

25:54.634 --> 25:58.696
the queue just now. Council Member Alcorn. Go ahead. Thank you, Chair. And thank

25:58.718 --> 26:02.104
you, Controller. I'm sorry I walked in a little bit late and maybe you talked

26:02.142 --> 26:06.396
a little bit about since it's a trends report, the trend of

26:06.498 --> 26:10.396
inflation and the trend of higher interest rates. How do you see that

26:10.578 --> 26:13.580
playing out in revenues and expenditures?

26:14.160 --> 26:18.732
So it is a challenge. We are in a very inflationary

26:18.796 --> 26:22.336
period. We are seeing inflation numbers that haven't been

26:22.358 --> 26:26.224
recorded since the 1980s.

26:26.422 --> 26:29.632
It's a challenge for the city in the sense the cost of goods, of everything

26:29.686 --> 26:34.900
we purchase are going up. Really to

26:34.970 --> 26:38.388
add on to that, interest rates are rising. So the cost of debt service and

26:38.394 --> 26:41.460
issuance, so these are putting financial strains on the budget.

26:42.280 --> 26:44.984
The good news right now is we do have a lot of federal money.

26:45.102 --> 26:48.970
Sales taxes up, property taxes up. But one of the things that

26:49.500 --> 26:53.032
I've termed, and I'm going to date myself, when I started working

26:53.086 --> 26:56.856
in an investment bank, alan Greenspan was the Federal Reserve Chair

26:56.888 --> 27:00.236
and towards the end of the.com

27:00.338 --> 27:04.056
boom he coined a term irrational

27:04.088 --> 27:08.130
exuberance because stocks are rising, money was coming in.

27:09.300 --> 27:12.704
I've said I think right now and again, I've been here

27:12.742 --> 27:16.560
19 years, I've been through the.com I'm 30 years almost

27:16.630 --> 27:19.808
in financial markets. It seems to me a

27:19.814 --> 27:23.236
little bit like irrational exuberance. We're seeing sales tax

27:23.338 --> 27:26.660
receipts over 20% on average. I mean, this is great news.

27:26.810 --> 27:29.840
But the key for governments is it has to be sustainable.

27:29.920 --> 27:33.656
And so the combined factor of

27:33.758 --> 27:36.776
increased inflation, increases in interest rates that are going to hit

27:36.798 --> 27:40.008
debt service and then this kind of false sense of security

27:40.094 --> 27:44.512
on revenues. I'm, as I said, more cautionary

27:44.676 --> 27:48.684
going forward. And for this fiscal year things are good

27:48.722 --> 27:52.552
and probably next fiscal year, but when we run out of the federal

27:52.696 --> 27:56.076
ARPA money, when that's limited? In December of

27:56.098 --> 27:59.488
2024. Really what's going to supplant that and

27:59.494 --> 28:03.916
you've talked about it in the past. The key is matching recurring expenditures

28:04.028 --> 28:07.676
with recurring revenues so we can't have a one time financing source

28:07.708 --> 28:11.524
with recurring expenditure. Thank you, council member. And your

28:11.562 --> 28:15.124
response, Controller. Go ahead.

28:15.242 --> 28:19.140
Sure. Just one more question about the recent changes

28:19.210 --> 28:22.664
to the OPEB, to our

28:22.702 --> 28:25.876
retiree benefits which will bring down our long term

28:25.908 --> 28:29.528
liability. Are you still in favor of looking into

28:29.614 --> 28:31.850
an OPEB trust as well?

28:32.860 --> 28:35.564
Yes. And I am. And this is a great example. In one of the things

28:35.602 --> 28:39.244
that's mentioned in the PFM report, if we

28:39.282 --> 28:42.812
set up an OPEB trust, essentially we are able

28:42.866 --> 28:46.408
to not just do PAYGO for these retiree

28:46.424 --> 28:49.628
healthcare benefits, we would actually invest that similar to

28:49.634 --> 28:52.624
the way we do in the pension. We would earn a return on that money.

28:52.822 --> 28:56.496
The challenge in starting the OPEB Trust is that we've never

28:56.518 --> 28:59.228
had the money to be able to fund it initially.

28:59.324 --> 29:02.516
And now we're sitting on this huge amount of federal money.

29:02.698 --> 29:05.476
What we can accomplish by putting 30,

29:05.578 --> 29:09.236
maybe $40 million into seat and OPEB Trust is,

29:09.338 --> 29:13.156
first and foremost, we can secure health care benefits for retirees, because as

29:13.178 --> 29:16.856
you all know around this table, those are not protected by state law.

29:16.958 --> 29:20.836
We could vote as a council body tomorrow and eliminate all of the retiree

29:20.868 --> 29:24.472
health care benefits. But more importantly, we can use a higher

29:24.526 --> 29:27.928
discount rate when we are evaluating that unfunded liability.

29:28.024 --> 29:31.452
So by putting a $30 million seed and starting

29:31.506 --> 29:35.324
an OPEB Trust, we could significantly reduce the

29:35.442 --> 29:38.616
long term unfunded liability of the OPEB,

29:38.648 --> 29:41.216
and we could do similar to what we did with the pensions. We had an

29:41.238 --> 29:44.716
$8 billion unfunded liability and now closer

29:44.748 --> 29:48.956
to 1.5 billion. Even with the reforms that Council passed previously

29:48.988 --> 29:52.644
on OPEB, we're still going to see probably in the next 15 years,

29:52.762 --> 29:57.296
4 billion or three plus billion dollar unfunded

29:57.328 --> 30:01.044
liability. This OPEB Trust spending, that amount of money would go a long

30:01.082 --> 30:04.280
way to reducing that long term unfunded liability.

30:04.620 --> 30:07.912
Thank you, Controller. That'd be a great start. Appreciate the question.

30:07.966 --> 30:12.296
Council Member Alcorn. We're going to hear from staff from Council Member Huffman's office.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.908
Hi, Controller. I have two questions about the PFM report that you brought

30:15.924 --> 30:19.148
up. One, given it happened in 2017, even though

30:19.154 --> 30:22.764
we paid like $500 million for it, do you

30:22.802 --> 30:26.496
think given all those changes since then, those recommendations are still

30:26.518 --> 30:28.930
relevant today, and then two,

30:29.620 --> 30:33.600
in your opinion, could ARPA dollars be not certainly

30:33.670 --> 30:37.312
better spent, but spent on implementing some of those cost

30:37.366 --> 30:41.476
savings that the PFM report recommends? Yeah, so good question.

30:41.658 --> 30:45.156
I think around $580,000 that we spent on

30:45.178 --> 30:48.228
the report. Absolutely.

30:48.394 --> 30:52.116
To the extent the ARPA money is fungible and we can

30:52.218 --> 30:55.476
use some of that for implementing these ideas,

30:55.668 --> 30:58.788
I would think there would probably need to be a refresher

30:58.884 --> 31:02.010
in the sense that yes, it has been five years.

31:02.460 --> 31:05.788
But I think the good news is, based on inflation and some

31:05.794 --> 31:09.660
of these other things, there might actually be more opportunity to save money

31:09.730 --> 31:13.084
today than in the past. But I think

31:13.122 --> 31:17.016
that the challenge is identifying the right teams

31:17.048 --> 31:20.464
to be able to go out and do this, that have experience doing

31:20.502 --> 31:24.640
it in other cities and can do it in a cost effective manner.

31:25.060 --> 31:28.972
Because one of the things I have seen historically

31:29.036 --> 31:32.772
at the city is we've spent money on projects like this and

31:32.906 --> 31:36.740
we spent a lot of money on them, and they haven't utilized the results.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.804
So I think it's important who you'd select. But I think

31:40.842 --> 31:43.560
absolutely, I think that was kind of the point I made earlier.

31:44.060 --> 31:48.136
We need to be using these federal dollars to reduce the

31:48.158 --> 31:52.196
structural imbalance in the future by adding more revenue or reducing recurring

31:52.228 --> 31:55.736
expenditures, rather than adding recurring

31:55.768 --> 31:58.892
expenditures. Thank you for that

31:58.946 --> 32:02.588
response and that gets to the end of our questions

32:02.674 --> 32:06.432
from the Horseshoe. And I just wanted to get

32:06.486 --> 32:10.044
one further bit of commentary from you. You quoted

32:10.092 --> 32:14.688
Greenspan with the irrational exuberance of times past.

32:14.854 --> 32:18.396
And in one of your charts for the sales tax revenue you

32:18.438 --> 32:22.550
spoke about the tapering off effect of some of the stimulus and

32:23.080 --> 32:26.704
curious about that, having heard recently the state's

32:26.752 --> 32:30.484
comptroller, Mr. Hager, talk about where

32:30.522 --> 32:33.736
we are with some of the incredible returns that we were

32:33.758 --> 32:38.056
getting through last year. Just in

32:38.078 --> 32:41.380
your opinion, is that part of the irrational exuberance

32:41.460 --> 32:44.884
or is that what's about to taper off? Well, I think it's

32:44.932 --> 32:48.860
to this point the irrational exuberance I think we're seeing yesterday in the stock market,

32:48.930 --> 32:52.492
for example, we're down 1100 points on the Dow. I mean, I think

32:52.626 --> 32:56.536
inflation, all these things really it's the multi

32:56.568 --> 33:00.796
trillion dollars of money that's been pumped into the economy that's just pushed

33:00.828 --> 33:04.752
everything up. It's pushed the stock market up. The rates of interest

33:04.806 --> 33:08.704
rates being lowered have done that as well. But definitely, I think from

33:08.742 --> 33:11.844
us. I can't remember a time at the city where

33:11.962 --> 33:15.492
we had an eight month rolling average of over 20%

33:15.626 --> 33:21.004
in sales tax. Now you have to couch that historically

33:21.072 --> 33:24.212
because COVID it was down quite a bit. But even with COVID

33:24.356 --> 33:28.148
being down, the rebound is spectacular.

33:28.244 --> 33:31.764
So just a principle

33:31.812 --> 33:34.952
for governmental budgeting. You really just

33:35.086 --> 33:38.312
plan on having a 3% to 5% increase hopefully

33:38.376 --> 33:41.996
every year and you base it off that. And if you go way below that

33:42.018 --> 33:45.324
or you go way above that, that delta starts to get very

33:45.362 --> 33:48.736
difficult to manage. So I think we were down and

33:48.758 --> 33:52.348
now we're so high up, I just caution the body that it's

33:52.364 --> 33:55.730
not going to sustain itself. And yes, we do expect sales tax to

33:56.420 --> 33:59.632
normalize next year and even be down

33:59.766 --> 34:02.956
year over year. But again, that's because we're up probably in the year,

34:02.998 --> 34:06.516
up 20% this year. And these are good things. It's just you have

34:06.538 --> 34:10.356
to prepare when you have very volatile times. You have to make kind

34:10.378 --> 34:13.988
of more long term strategic decisions in the sense that it's not going to

34:13.994 --> 34:17.124
go up another three or 5% probably next year. It's definitely

34:17.162 --> 34:21.136
not going to go up 20% again next year. I appreciate

34:21.168 --> 34:25.064
that very much. Thanks for that final comment. And I think this does conclude

34:25.112 --> 34:28.476
our special called BFA committee meeting. So. Thank you,

34:28.498 --> 34:28.840
Controller.
