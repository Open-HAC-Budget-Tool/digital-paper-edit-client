1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,600
Airport system. We will now transition to

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,226
Houston Health and Director

3
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:13,354
Williams director

4
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:17,434
Stephen Williams and Darren Asher and council member,

5
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:20,990
pilot, vice chair. Would you step in the seat, council Member Jackson,

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,310
1 minute.

7
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,254
At this time, I want to welcome director Stephen Williams and Darren

8
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:17,666
Asher to provide the Houston Health Department budget. The floor is

9
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:18,370
yours.

10
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,174
Good afternoon. As you said,

11
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:28,902
I'm Stephen Williams, director of the Houston Health Department. I'm here

12
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:32,722
to present our General Fund and Special Fund budget

13
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:36,266
for the fiscal year 2023. I want

14
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:39,626
to start by introducing my staff there behind me, so I don't know where they

15
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:42,966
are. I have with me Judy Harris,

16
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:45,850
who's Chief of Staff and deputy director.

17
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,762
Also Darren Asher, who's our chief financial

18
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:54,266
officer and administration. Also is Amber Hague,

19
00:01:54,298 --> 00:01:58,110
who's behind me, also who does one part of our administration.

20
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,470
Stepping in for our communications officer is Dr. Faith Foreman,

21
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,714
who's administratively over that unit right now. But you should

22
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,754
be familiar with portfolio Villarrell, who is our

23
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:13,670
Pio and Councilor Liaison.

24
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,754
Also with me is my assistant, Randy Presley assistant Director,

25
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:22,450
Patrick Key, over Environmental Naomi Macys,

26
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,710
assistant Director for Clinical and Multi Service Center Operations,

27
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,062
Dr. Shannon Bivens, the Deputy Director for Public Health, Evelyn Schaefer,

28
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:34,634
deputy Director of Human Services and

29
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:38,410
Financial Division Manager, Shamika Marshall

30
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,206
I want to express publicly my gratitude for

31
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,310
the staff, especially during the last two and a half years.

32
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,946
Although for you all, things might seem relatively calm in the

33
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,446
community. With rates of COVID slowly rising,

34
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:55,906
we're still providing testing and vaccination services to

35
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:59,266
the community. At the same time, we're resetting these

36
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:03,074
services that we have within the Houston Health Department

37
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:06,326
and transitioning to what we would call

38
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:10,070
possibly a new normal. But I don't know that any of us really knows

39
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,714
what that is. Now go to the next slide,

40
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:17,606
please, with vision, mission and goals. Our mission

41
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:21,226
is to work in partnership with the community to promote and protect the health and

42
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:24,780
social well being of Houstonians and the environment in which they live.

43
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,002
It's not practical to try to do public health alone.

44
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:32,766
Community involvement is key to our success. Our partnerships were

45
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:36,874
certainly instrumental in our ongoing COVID response, certainly related

46
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:40,546
to testing and vaccinations and the

47
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:43,826
critical for effective interventions within the community.

48
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:47,186
We don't think that we can do it all.

49
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:50,654
We exist in public health to improve access to

50
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:53,974
care, to prevent spread of infectious disease to

51
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:57,634
promote opportunities for healthy living and reduce burden of chronic

52
00:03:57,682 --> 00:04:01,270
disease which most people die from protect the community

53
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,794
from environmental hazards to improve health and well being through

54
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:08,698
human services improve health of mothers, infants and children

55
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:12,454
and prepare to respond to disasters and emergencies.

56
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,186
And certainly we try to do that in a culture of excellence.

57
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,286
Next slide, please. This is

58
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:23,374
our functional organizational chart. In our General Fund,

59
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:27,022
it supports 374 positions. Within our Special

60
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:31,166
Funds, it supports 285 positions which totals

61
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:34,878
about 660 FPS between those two funds.

62
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:38,434
Our administration, I'll tell you, is just 9.9%

63
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:41,858
of the General Fund, especially funds.

64
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:46,198
But I have to add in our grant funds. Our grant funds support

65
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:49,574
675 positions and this is

66
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:53,190
not including COVID sources.

67
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,690
Those funds are approximately $63 million.

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,538
That will be a total for normal operations of about 1336

69
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:07,034
FTEs for Florida department administration is 7.6%

70
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:11,182
of that. Well, we have COVID with the $91 million

71
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:15,502
that we have annually for COVID. You need to add another 485

72
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:19,074
positions to that, bringing our total positions within the health

73
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:23,570
department now to 1821 for the entire department.

74
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,562
Administration of all of that is still reduced to

75
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:31,974
6.3% of our budget. And I say that because

76
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:35,800
without administration we can't really get the job done.

77
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,134
I'm extremely proud of the scope of the programs and

78
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:43,814
services that we provide. Although in some of our

79
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:47,354
programs I do not believe that the scale in programs like

80
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:51,562
our Don, our Reentry program, see to Succeed, our scale should certainly

81
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:54,746
be much broader to match the scale of the problem of

82
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:58,670
the condition that exists here in the city of Houston.

83
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,926
The next slide is a summary of our major services.

84
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:06,398
Did something different this year? I wanted to

85
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:10,530
give you an idea of how much the General Fund supports public health

86
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,580
within this community.

87
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,178
If you look at the services that are highlighted in green, you will see that

88
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:21,574
our General Fund primarily supports environmental health,

89
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:24,850
which has food safety, special waste and pools.

90
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,098
Our clinical services out of four health centers,

91
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:32,534
eleven multi service centers, and hopefully in the

92
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:36,186
2023 budget year we'll add on a leaf and

93
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,782
with a new Sunnyside facility, thank God, and a regional

94
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:43,674
lab. But if you look at those programs that are in red,

95
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:47,418
there's limited or no General Fund support for those programs.

96
00:06:47,514 --> 00:06:50,814
TB, Immunizations, Maternal and Child Health

97
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:54,446
C to Succeed, which provides free vision exams and

98
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:57,818
glasses to children. My brother's keeper reentry.

99
00:06:57,914 --> 00:07:01,826
Certainly WIC is a grant funded program. All of our COVID operations and

100
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:05,406
testing and vaccine is supported by grants. The programs

101
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:08,974
that I did mention are primarily supported through grants and special revenue

102
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:11,060
funds. Next slide, please.

103
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,718
This slide lists state and local codes and ordinance that mandates

104
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:22,134
some of the public health services that we provide, such as Disease

105
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:25,846
Prevention and Control, environmental Regulatory service and vital statistics.

106
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:30,042
Chapter One and 121. The Public Health Reorganization Act authorizes

107
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:33,230
municipalities to enforce laws to protect public health,

108
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,942
receive grants, appoint a local health authority. And that would be Dr.

109
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:40,386
David Purse. Our local ordinances, chapter 21 and

110
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:43,662
22 establishes the local health department.

111
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:48,050
Subsequent ordinances establish certain programs such as air pollution and

112
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,900
vital statistics. Next slide, please.

113
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,454
The medical nature of our operations requires specialized

114
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:58,754
licenses and certification. This has a major impact

115
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:02,198
on recruitment intention given our proximity to the medical center.

116
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:05,834
As I mentioned in the past, our department was the first health

117
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:09,370
department in Texas to become accredited. We was the second major

118
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,562
city in the country to become Fab accredited during

119
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:17,246
the Pandemic. We became reaccredited, and we are accredited for

120
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:20,080
the next five years to 2026.

121
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,346
With the accreditation, hopefully we can demonstrate increased accountability

122
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,334
and credibility to the public, to the funders, certainly to you and

123
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:31,460
partner organizations which we work with.

124
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,780
Next slide, please.

125
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,414
Licenses and certification that are required. Our business requires certain licenses

126
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:44,290
and certification, as you can see the

127
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,606
requirements for a laboratory and pharmacy. I want to

128
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:51,430
highlight that our lab does not only support our clinics, but it's a specialty lab

129
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,050
supporting 17 surrounding counties. Our stat lab

130
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,730
provides onsite lab testing and our specific multi service

131
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,406
clinics. The Bureau of Laboratory Services provide a variety

132
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:06,010
of clinical and environmental testing and support of various

133
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,210
health department programs, including our lead TB,

134
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,574
Epidemiology, Environmental Services, Hi V.

135
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:16,074
STD. Our wastewater surveillance.

136
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:20,340
And I want to really highlight wastewater surveillance because it

137
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,334
has really gotten national attention. It's a partnership

138
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:27,682
with Rice thanks to Carol Hednock and Public

139
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:31,174
Works and her folks are very cooperative during the Pandemic having

140
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,750
their staff actually collecting those samples.

141
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,030
We have actually been a source of support for other

142
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,506
jurisdictions within the country that are wanting to

143
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:46,170
get into wastewater testing because they see ours as a model,

144
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,706
given that the Public Works

145
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:55,406
wastewater system as it exists within the

146
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,274
city. Of course, with wastewater surveillance,

147
00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:03,134
we're able to predict COVID-19 trends from one to two weeks

148
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:07,050
before other surveillance metrics like testing.

149
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,642
And of course, we use that information to guide our

150
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:14,066
strategies related to COVID. I have to tell

151
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:17,714
you that even though the numbers are low now,

152
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:21,218
we're still concerned with several geographical areas

153
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:24,866
within the city where there are low vaccination rates coupled

154
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:27,778
with other social economic challenges.

155
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:32,706
Hopefully you will be seeing a number of contracts

156
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:36,246
where we're trying to partner with more community based organizations

157
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,010
to have further reach into those specific communities.

158
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,026
The next slide, please. I have been doing this presentation for

159
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:48,702
about 18 years, and I have to always do this slide just

160
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:53,082
to highlight the level of investment, the general fund investment,

161
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:56,190
and the health department. Overall.

162
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,842
This slide illustrates the city's net fund general

163
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:03,940
fund investment in public health. It's only for $40 million.

164
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,434
The Health Department's 23 target is $65

165
00:11:08,472 --> 00:11:12,182
million. 2 million of that is to cover environmental health special

166
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:15,778
revenue funds. But please understand that we generate

167
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:19,606
$25.6 million in revenue. That's where

168
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:23,146
we get that number from. But it's also to

169
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:26,570
note that out of $40 million investment,

170
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,562
19 million is in restricted funds, which means

171
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:35,502
that I only have control of $20 million in general

172
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:38,830
fund to really do public health

173
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,254
programming and that's of a

174
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:45,806
budget of $165,000,000

175
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:50,114
totally if you include our grants and other special

176
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:53,406
funds. The next slide,

177
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:57,362
please. Our revenues by Fund Fund

178
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,766
100 represents an increase of $3 million

179
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,974
in revenue, and it's related to multiple grants in support of

180
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:07,862
COVID-19 that are generating additional indirect cost

181
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:11,222
recovery. When we bring in grants, we hire people,

182
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:15,034
we actually increase the bottom line of the General Fund because of

183
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:18,234
indirect cost. This revenue is

184
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:22,214
driven directly by our ability to hire grant

185
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:26,106
staff, which means the more grant staff we hire, the more indirect

186
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:29,002
dollars we can actually draw down from the grants.

187
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:33,354
In Fund 22, an increase

188
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:36,750
of approximately $2 million reflects a one time transfer

189
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,740
from the General Fund to cover our environmental health experience

190
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,262
expenses. This program staff activity

191
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:50,290
actually generate enough revenue to cover the program expenses.

192
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,350
Fund 2010 represents a reduction of approximately

193
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,214
$3.1 million in revenue due to the 1115

194
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:01,782
waiver actually coming to an end, we are slated to

195
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:05,420
get our last payment in July of this year.

196
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,042
Overall, in our budget you will see an increase in revenue of $2.2

197
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,100
billion.

198
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,540
The next slide actually is a highlight of

199
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,606
the summary of revenue by Fund. I'm not going to go over that because if

200
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:24,302
you go to the next slide, I can actually talk more specifically about

201
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:28,670
those funds and Fund 100, the expenditure

202
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,366
breakdown. Of course, 60% of the General Fund supports

203
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:35,410
personnel for administrative services, environmental health,

204
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,214
oral health and clinical staff, and the health Clinics laboratory

205
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:42,680
Morality Service Centers. It's really a repeat of what I said before.

206
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,350
40% of the General Fund supports non personnel items.

207
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,442
Of that, I'd just like to note that only 18% of the non personnel

208
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:55,482
funds support departmental operations. We primarily rely on

209
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:59,206
grant and special revenue funds to make ends

210
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,046
meet when it comes to buying equipment,

211
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:05,360
supplies and services.

212
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,042
The next slide, please. Expenditures by Funds

213
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,790
this slide is a summary, so I'm going to go to the next page,

214
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,020
which breaks it down by detail.

215
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,746
All funds highlight expenditure highlights. In Fund 1000,

216
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:27,730
expenditures increased by $5.5 million

217
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,934
due to $1.2 million in hope

218
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:35,238
and pension increases. $1.6 million for new

219
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:39,574
a leaf facility, which only represents the

220
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,642
third time in 18 years that I've actually gotten General Fund money

221
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:47,290
for programs in public health. The only other two times

222
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,070
was when we needed more overtime

223
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,418
in jail health, which was a mandated services,

224
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:59,598
and we got a cut in federal dollars for our TB services

225
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:03,338
and we needed to backfill some of those dollars. So I'm grateful.

226
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,760
Even though it's the third time in 18 years.

227
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,326
Fund 2002 increases include additional

228
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:13,890
funds for expansion of our AAA Veterans Affairs program.

229
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,794
Of course, that's grant funded funds in 2008 2009

230
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:21,382
there were no significant changes, and funds in 2010

231
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:24,646
no significant changes. But as I said, we're getting that

232
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:28,118
last payment for that in July of this year.

233
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:32,146
Fund 2023 Special Waste Fund reflects

234
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:36,540
the transfer eleven FTEs to the Health Special Revenue Fund from

235
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,498
2002 as part of the department's attempt to

236
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:45,454
reduce expenditures. Really, this is

237
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:48,762
really charging a portion of consumer health staff

238
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:52,234
to this Fund. The next slide,

239
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:52,880
please.

240
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,714
Personnel versus non personnel in Fund 22.

241
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:04,502
This is a catch. All fund used to manage revenue that is generated

242
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:08,758
for a variety of programs. This includes Environmental

243
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,190
Consumer Health RFID program,

244
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,086
which is really the RFIDs that you have on the

245
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:20,814
food trucks. Our Veterans Affairs that I mentioned

246
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:24,800
earlier, medicaid Administrative Claiming, which is really

247
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,498
based on a cost report that we are due for providing services

248
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:32,162
related to Medicaid clients and also

249
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:35,170
vital records and parking garage fees.

250
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,190
54% of all funds support personnel.

251
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,186
This is related to the issuance of ambulance permitting

252
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:46,594
support the Veterans Administration program by assisting

253
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:50,502
veterans with services staffing to support parking garage

254
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:54,250
at our stadium facility and staff to support

255
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,170
nondirect services paid for with Medicaid dollars

256
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,690
such as billing.

257
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,490
46% of those are of those funds

258
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,790
are non personnel items. 3% is in restricted accounts.

259
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,878
The 72% is for non subrecipient contracts

260
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:19,038
and basically that's used in environmental health to replace obsolete

261
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:23,266
equipment in our RFID program and to

262
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:26,260
operate our Digital Health Online food Managers class.

263
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,230
Next slide, please. In laboratory services. This is pretty straightforward.

264
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,230
The revenue from this Fund supports our lab operations and provides

265
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,306
funding for laboratory equipment and laboratory and

266
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:41,820
and laboratory services.

267
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,974
A lot of our grants I'd like to mention actually support some of our laboratory

268
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:51,562
services too, but this is the General Fund

269
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:55,930
supportive Personnel and non personnel on swimming pools.

270
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,282
69% of the Fund supports personnel.

271
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,598
31% supports supplies and services,

272
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:07,970
including mandatory education and training and testing supplies.

273
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,946
The Fund 2010 Essential Public Health Services

274
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:16,942
want to take a little bit more time to highlight what this Fund had actually

275
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:20,646
done over the last few years? This 1115

276
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:24,290
waiver supports both waiver

277
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,226
programs and essential public health core

278
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:31,594
services. In the past years, we have used these funds to

279
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:35,322
support general operations, general Fund operations such as

280
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:39,286
laboratory services, TB control, maintenance contracts

281
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,998
and clinic supplies. This Fund has been a lifesaver

282
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:46,926
for the Department operation and allowed us to be responsive in the

283
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:50,926
emergencies. Over the last ten years, we have minimized the

284
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:54,282
negative impact of General Fund reductions over the last

285
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:57,490
few years by using these funds.

286
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,838
We have an average of about 200 FTEs supported

287
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:05,506
through this Fund. Over the past five years, we have

288
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:09,506
funded programs, as I said earlier, like C to Succeed. Projecting savior smiles,

289
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:12,998
my brother's keeper reentry supported lab services,

290
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:17,254
our Don program, chronic disease, as well as our

291
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:20,566
administrative services division. These funds

292
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:23,834
are limited. So in the next year, what you will see is

293
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:27,750
a restructuring plan to reduce both FTEs and operational

294
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,460
support.

295
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,582
Next slide please. Fund 24 23

296
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:39,214
special waste our fog program. Basically,

297
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:42,938
this Fund supports our fat, soil and grease inspections.

298
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:47,182
It includes support for 48.3 FTEs.

299
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:51,282
The Fund is 84% personnel and supports those

300
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:55,010
activities. 16% of the Fund support operations,

301
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,646
36% is allocated to restricted accounts

302
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:03,830
and 64% is allocated to supply services and equipment.

303
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,802
Next slide, please. 2023 budget

304
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:14,060
Expenditure net Changes okay,

305
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,074
of course, the first section covers the $61.1

306
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:23,806
million, which is our current FY 21 22

307
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:26,926
budget. Excuse me. Section two

308
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:31,630
covers the operational operating budget adjustments.

309
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,114
You see in that adjustments for

310
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:40,126
our 1115 waiver, our intergovernmental

311
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:43,966
transfer funds, and also where we had received some council

312
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:48,642
funds. The third section contractual

313
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,514
mandated adjustments related to benefits, restricted accounts

314
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:56,550
and our new a leaf facility. As I mentioned earlier.

315
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,594
The fourth section is the proposed budget includes $2.2

316
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:05,322
million transfer to the Special Health Revenue Fund for community

317
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:08,890
health and environmental consumer health. Those are to fund those

318
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,700
to transfer those eleven positions to that cost center.

319
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,162
The current budget minus operating adjustments, plus mandated adjustments

320
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:20,750
equal to a budget of $65.6 million,

321
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,046
which is a 7.4% increase in our

322
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:27,166
General Fund budget. The next slide

323
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:30,626
gives our budget history. Probably need to explain it

324
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:34,306
to you a little bit, because if you note in

325
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:37,826
FY 19, the adopted budget does what didn't

326
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:41,334
include jail health. But remember, we had to operate jail health for

327
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:44,946
an additional year because the Joint Processing

328
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:48,214
Center didn't open for another year.

329
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:52,218
In FY 22, the estimate includes a 1.2 restricted account

330
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:55,882
adjustment for the $750,000

331
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:59,740
hope adjustments in FY 21.

332
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,726
Just so that you will understand what

333
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:09,562
we did there in that fiscal year, we redeployed

334
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:13,990
General Fund staff to work COVID and so we built those expenses

335
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,666
to those COVID grants which resulted in

336
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:20,500
a reduced expenditures to the General Fund.

337
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,700
And in FY 22 you will also see

338
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,390
that resulted in the restricted accounts increase,

339
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,598
which basically it is going to charge us more than what we

340
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,750
have budgeted because we brought on more people and more computers.

341
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,940
That pretty much explains that.

342
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,446
That's the end of my financial budget presentation

343
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:48,140
for FY 23.

344
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,300
Thank you Director, for your presentation. A couple of questions.

345
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,554
What are the areas of our city that have the low vaccination

346
00:22:56,602 --> 00:23:00,334
rates? I'm not going to guess. Why don't I send you

347
00:23:00,372 --> 00:23:04,182
the map that we have? During the height of COVID

348
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:08,462
we actually did a weekly report showing

349
00:23:08,606 --> 00:23:12,414
areas that were concerned, there were target areas,

350
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:16,770
just what we characterized as high COVID vulnerability

351
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,606
areas based on an index that was produced by developed by

352
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:24,774
CDC. Yeah, if you could send that to all of our offices, that would be

353
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:28,230
great. We have some areas,

354
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,854
I'm sure. Let's go to slide

355
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:33,820
eight, please.

356
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,546
So to get clarification on this slide

357
00:23:43,578 --> 00:23:46,850
again, with 40

358
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,740
million, you all are able to generate revenues of 25 million.

359
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,770
Yes. So if we were to allocate more dollars

360
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,030
to you from the General Fund, would you be able to also generate more revenue?

361
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,882
Probably not, because the areas that generate the revenue

362
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:11,290
are primarily in our environmental health area where we're collecting fees

363
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,642
for permits. If I had more General Fund

364
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:19,674
dollars, of course I would spend them in programmatic areas. I think

365
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,390
we need to focus more on chronic disease. I think we need to focus

366
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,546
more on balance,

367
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:31,006
youth balance. And I think that we

368
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:34,160
need to also focus more on maternal child health issues.

369
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,330
So comparison for the general fund dollars that we allocate

370
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,970
estimated, how many dollars will you get in grants?

371
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,598
I can tell you what we know that we're going to get. We're going to

372
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:52,198
get about $65 million in the coming

373
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:55,670
year in grants, and that's all over the map.

374
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,782
We will have probably about $91 million

375
00:24:59,836 --> 00:25:03,420
in COVID dollars, but those dollars are going to end in about a year.

376
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,026
So the $65 million you'll get

377
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,226
in grants, is that including the COVID dollars or no?

378
00:25:11,328 --> 00:25:14,982
No. So outside of the COVID dollars, you're still going to get around estimated

379
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:19,166
$65 million in grants? Yes. And that's about what

380
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:22,494
we usually get. Our budget for the last couple of years have been running about,

381
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:26,530
what, $160,000,000,000 within that range

382
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,386
for everything special funds, general funds, and grants. You want

383
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:33,966
to use your microphone, Mr. Ashley, for everything, special funds,

384
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:37,940
general funds, and grants by 165. Thank you.

385
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,370
Next, we have questions by Council member Amy Peck.

386
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,750
Thank you, Vice Chair. And thank you, Director, for the presentation.

387
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,458
When you were talking about the 1115 waiver restructuring

388
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:52,986
and adjusting and moving personnel from that fund, can you just

389
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:56,154
talk about that a little bit more for clarity? So you're moving

390
00:25:56,192 --> 00:26:00,074
personnel from the 1115 waiver that we were using to pay for their

391
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:03,600
salaries to where's that money coming from now?

392
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,280
Well,

393
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,674
and I'm sure you've heard this from other department directors, but the

394
00:26:14,712 --> 00:26:17,950
general fund doesn't support some of the essential

395
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,038
programs that I think our department should be running back.

396
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:25,894
Starting in, I think, 2011, 2012, we were

397
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:28,786
able to access 1115 Waiver funds.

398
00:26:28,898 --> 00:26:32,470
With those funds, we were able to bring on programs

399
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,330
that I thought we needed to be running

400
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,330
within the Health Department. For example, see, to succeed

401
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,854
my Brother's Keeper program, our reentry program

402
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:49,150
is funded by 1115 Waiver.

403
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,526
So when those the 200 positions I

404
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:58,242
mentioned, I can't just put them on the general fund. The general

405
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:02,962
fund can't absorb them. So I will have to find other

406
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:06,434
resources if we want to keep those services. If I'm not

407
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:10,190
able to recoup enough

408
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,280
revenue, we will have to actually reduce those services.

409
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,294
Okay, so at this point, you're just looking for grants and other ways to pay

410
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:21,434
for them. You're not moving anybody to the general fund that

411
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,306
was on the 1115 waiver? My boss wouldn't let me do

412
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:29,226
that. Okay. And then my

413
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:33,446
last question is about environmental health. Something I've

414
00:27:33,478 --> 00:27:37,134
talked to Public Works about when it comes to inspections is

415
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:40,330
working with other departments so that we're looking at if it's

416
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,782
an apartment complex or a house that needs certain inspections, that we're working

417
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:48,686
together and not working separately. So can

418
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,482
you just talk a little bit about how well that has been from your

419
00:27:52,536 --> 00:27:56,014
perspective, working with Public Works to make sure that everything is being inspected

420
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:59,574
kind of all at once? I think we have a very good working relationship

421
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:03,522
with Public works, especially as it relates to the apartment complex,

422
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:07,254
because sometimes a complaint will come into one

423
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:10,534
department or the other. And our staff has

424
00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:14,502
been around long enough that they know what's our scope of responsibility

425
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:17,370
and know to bring those other departments in.

426
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,226
I think that the Waste Water Surveillance Initiative is a

427
00:28:21,248 --> 00:28:24,846
good example of how Public Works and our department are

428
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:28,526
working well together. One thing that it's in the

429
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:32,506
works. I haven't really told staff about this, but they'll know now. Council Member

430
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:36,174
Kayman is carol and I

431
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:39,602
were out at an event related to lead and we thought

432
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:43,026
that we could actually broaden those activities because of

433
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:46,514
just the age of the houses. And in the last week or so,

434
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:50,086
we're passing emails back and forth talking about how we

435
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:51,480
were going to approach this.

436
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,286
Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you,

437
00:28:59,308 --> 00:29:03,110
Vice Chair. And thank you, Director, for all the great work you've done during COVID

438
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,380
on slide four. Thank you for that. The red and green one.

439
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,700
You were talking about administrative funds, and I wanted to be clear.

440
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:16,240
Those grant funds do come with administrative funds built in.

441
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,018
You're not supporting all of those with general fund admin?

442
00:29:21,114 --> 00:29:24,126
No. Yeah, we couldn't support and they have

443
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:27,746
varying percentages, I'm sure, of administrative funds associated with

444
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:30,580
those. They do. Okay, great.

445
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,834
Houston permitting and I rarely get any complaints about

446
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:38,254
the Health Department. Houston part of Houston Permitting.

447
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:42,006
How many employees do you I mean, I know swimming pool safety and then what

448
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:45,942
else do you do? Like at HPC? Do you know how many FTEs are over

449
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:49,350
there in the permitting system from hell? No, I don't. But Patrick,

450
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,300
four total. Okay.

451
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,222
And on temporary employees, you mentioned that as we are seeing decreases

452
00:29:59,286 --> 00:30:02,086
in COVID and the grants funding,

453
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:05,678
I mean, do you anticipate that some of the temporary employees or some of

454
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:09,534
the people we've taken on will not no longer be I mean,

455
00:30:09,732 --> 00:30:13,706
how long do you anticipate most of the COVID related temporary employees?

456
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:17,700
Well, an interesting thing has happened during COVID especially during this point

457
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,046
in our other programs, whether they're grant funded

458
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:25,586
in some general fund positions. We have a lot of vacancies on that side.

459
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:28,786
So those individuals that have been working no good. Yeah.

460
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:32,278
We are looking to figure out whether or

461
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:36,054
not there is a fit. We don't want to run the

462
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:39,782
risk of letting everybody go and then we go into another

463
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:43,094
surgeon. So we're engaging in some cross training.

464
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:47,018
Sure. Okay. And finally, I was going to ask the

465
00:30:47,024 --> 00:30:50,378
kinder and Hobby School study that talked about a

466
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:54,046
tale of two departments that came out in December. Did recommend

467
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:57,374
some areas where we could possibly do an MoU with

468
00:30:57,412 --> 00:31:00,160
the county. Not talking about merging departments or anything.

469
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,810
Don't beat me up between us.

470
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,226
Okay. But if you could opine a bit.

471
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,018
They list several areas of overlap and disease control

472
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:15,394
and prevention, dental services, environmental, public health,

473
00:31:15,432 --> 00:31:18,914
women and Children's health, Nutrition and Chronic Disease Program, public Health

474
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:22,050
Awareness Policy and Planning and Finance Administration.

475
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,858
I mean, could we start small with some MoUs? And you've

476
00:31:25,874 --> 00:31:29,078
done a good job, like with air quality monitoring and stuff like that with the

477
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:32,594
county, but where could we do an additional MoU to possibly

478
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:36,630
gain Efficiencies one day? Okay, I'm going to make a general comment

479
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,282
because they made a comment publicly that somebody told me about.

480
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:43,854
I wasn't very pleased with the report because I do not

481
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:48,174
think that they accurately represented the

482
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:51,920
differences between the department. I will give you an example.

483
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,960
When they looked at our immunization program,

484
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,706
they compared our putting shots in arms and the

485
00:31:58,728 --> 00:32:01,890
county's putting shots in arm. That is

486
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,060
a minor part of our immunization program.

487
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,474
We have relationships with all of the providers within

488
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:13,170
Houston and Harris County. We're a state contractor

489
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,902
that have to monitor our Vaccines for Children program and

490
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:20,214
all of that. None of that stuff was included, and so I think they

491
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:23,418
fell short of that. But to the core of your question,

492
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:26,700
there are a lot of things that we are doing with the county. We mentioned

493
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,274
our One Safe, Houston. The credible messenger stuff.

494
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:35,422
We have been working with them. There are some things that we already have

495
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:38,394
in place that they just missed.

496
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:42,922
We were in the middle of COVID My staff did send me responses,

497
00:32:42,986 --> 00:32:46,100
but they weren't that complimentary, so I didn't send them.

498
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,266
But we are in the process of working with the county, and what

499
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:55,540
we're going to do is come up with an MoU that really

500
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,878
will formalize the relationships that we have.

501
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:04,966
What I'm looking at is actually modeling it after an

502
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:08,678
interlocal agreement that I'm familiar with between the City of

503
00:33:08,684 --> 00:33:13,254
Austin and Travis County. And I lived that life for

504
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:16,954
years, and so I know how that can be modeled. Thank you. I'd appreciate just

505
00:33:16,992 --> 00:33:19,820
being kept in the loop on that. I'll do it. Thank you.

506
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,658
Council member Abby Cayman. Hi, Director.

507
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:27,486
Hi. First off, I really want

508
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:31,422
to recognize the department under your leadership for everything during

509
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:35,098
COVID We quickly talk about COVID and talk about shots and

510
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:38,546
arms, but the extent to which you and

511
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:42,386
the entire department have had to deal with not

512
00:33:42,408 --> 00:33:46,770
only an unprecedented global pandemic, but the primary purpose,

513
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,694
you all were at the tip of the spear in terms of the response to

514
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:54,374
that. So thank you to everyone for

515
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:58,306
everything that you did and continue to do because it's

516
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:02,086
still ongoing. But on top of all of that, all the programs you continue to

517
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:06,166
run. Working with my office on the lead survey that we did in Friedman's

518
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:10,106
town, even just on the phone right now trying to work through some

519
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:13,680
of the formula shortage issues. You all continue to

520
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,866
be that first line of response and caring

521
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:21,680
for Houstonians every single day to that point. I don't know if you mentioned it.

522
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,530
How many Houstonians does the health department serve?

523
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:32,290
Well, there are different answers to that question

524
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,778
because it depends on the program. For the most part,

525
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:39,574
our department covers all of Houston, so the total

526
00:34:39,612 --> 00:34:43,154
population of Houston. But for certain programs,

527
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:46,486
we cover all of Harris County. The Immunization program that

528
00:34:46,508 --> 00:34:50,062
I mentioned earlier, one would think that our responsibility

529
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:53,370
is only the city of Houston, but it's not. It's all

530
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,794
of Harris County. We are the

531
00:34:56,832 --> 00:35:00,730
state's point for Immunizations within all of Harris County

532
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,606
for our laboratory services. And I mentioned this. We actually have

533
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:08,094
a 17 county catchment area. So it really

534
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:11,386
depends on the program. But our core

535
00:35:11,418 --> 00:35:14,846
is Houston, our Seed to succeed program, because we partially fund it

536
00:35:14,868 --> 00:35:18,786
through grants. We service all of the school districts within the

537
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:21,730
region, not just HISD.

538
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:27,134
I appreciate that answer in the context I'm going to switch gears

539
00:35:27,182 --> 00:35:30,600
really quickly. I'm going to ask an unpleasant question.

540
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,994
Looking at page nine. The Swimming Pool

541
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,120
Safety Fund.

542
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,238
I'm not as familiar with that program. And given

543
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:46,906
the fact that I don't want to be asking this question, I don't want us

544
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:50,154
to be in the position where we aren't going to have pools open this

545
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:54,426
summer. What we've heard from the Parks Department is because we don't have enough lifeguards,

546
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:58,190
we're going to have to reduce the number of pools open. Does that impact

547
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,960
the Pool Safety Fund in terms of operation or what's needed there?

548
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,914
We will. Patrick Key

549
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:10,610
is our assistant director, and shortly after he came in,

550
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,446
naomi Macias, who is newly appointed assistant

551
00:36:14,478 --> 00:36:17,758
Director, was actually over consumer in that.

552
00:36:17,864 --> 00:36:20,946
But several years ago, we developed

553
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:25,238
a strategy where we cross train people to make sure that

554
00:36:25,404 --> 00:36:29,154
when swimming pool season arrived,

555
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:33,374
we were able to redeploy staff to actually ensure

556
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,858
that pools were inspected. It's one of the programs where

557
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,326
I get calls from my neighbor if my community pool

558
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:43,866
is not open or there's a problem with it. So it's like that. So the

559
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:47,646
resources that are allocated here are still being utilized even though the

560
00:36:47,668 --> 00:36:50,890
public pools may be limited. In operations,

561
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,926
we inspect parks pools. Actually, that was one of the first things I did when

562
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:58,894
I came here. Joe and his folks were inspecting their own pools,

563
00:36:58,942 --> 00:37:02,514
and we had an agreement that it would probably be

564
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:06,002
best if the Health Department, which inspected all other public

565
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:08,840
pools, inspected parks pools. Also.

566
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,278
I'll follow up on the question. I know my time is I'll put you

567
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:17,750
back in the car. Thank you, council Member Jackson. Thank you.

568
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,542
And thank you, Director Williams, for just all your work

569
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:24,826
and just the partnership. I know my office worked closely with you.

570
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:28,246
We were able to get in the incredible messenger program rolled

571
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:31,834
out and other initiatives. So just thank you and your staff for just

572
00:37:31,872 --> 00:37:35,790
your commitment. As I'm looking at the major services and

573
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,342
I see all the services that your major

574
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:43,306
services under Human Services, the highlighted ones, is just disturbing

575
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:47,618
to see that. There's no dollars allocated for General

576
00:37:47,704 --> 00:37:51,374
fund dollars allocated for these services, like Aging and Disabilities

577
00:37:51,422 --> 00:37:54,898
and Reentry program. This is Human Services.

578
00:37:54,984 --> 00:37:58,306
And so my question to you is, how many grant

579
00:37:58,338 --> 00:38:01,794
writers do you have? Because it seemed like you're spending all your time writing grants

580
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:06,034
to serve the people. Usually in health departments,

581
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:10,046
the folks that direct the programs

582
00:38:10,098 --> 00:38:12,806
write the grants. We don't have special grant writers,

583
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:16,198
except sometimes our planners

584
00:38:16,214 --> 00:38:20,122
or analysts will write grants. But you will find

585
00:38:20,176 --> 00:38:23,550
people all over our department writing grants.

586
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:27,646
Okay. I know recently with

587
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:30,954
the One Safe Houston, there was anywhere

588
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:34,062
from I know there was a lot of money from the ARPA dollars.

589
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:37,026
So does the budget include those dollars,

590
00:38:37,128 --> 00:38:40,820
or is it we did not include opera dollars.

591
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,674
We did not include the opera dollars in this report because

592
00:38:46,872 --> 00:38:50,758
we were still going through the process. Okay, all right.

593
00:38:50,844 --> 00:38:53,510
It would only add $2 million to the budget.

594
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,166
Okay, well, we need those. I'm talking about from my department. Oh,

595
00:38:58,188 --> 00:39:02,022
really? Yes. I know how to know that. Maybe three,

596
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:05,194
but I'm at you only 1 million for

597
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:09,820
reentry, and then I think a half million for

598
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:17,006
Credible Messenger, and then maybe another million for

599
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:18,430
street interventions.

600
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,480
Okay, thank you, sir. All right,

601
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,070
Council Member Cayman,

602
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,522
I'll submit a question to you all related to the pool fund,

603
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:35,474
so I can understand a little bit more. But lastly, Director, you've already

604
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:39,582
flagged some of the needs. And what I'm asking every department

605
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:43,734
is, as we look ahead, we have the financial constraints imposed by the city based

606
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:47,910
on revenue caps and other things. But looking ahead,

607
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,098
what do we need to be aware of on the horizon for the needs of

608
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:54,154
the Health Department? I think I

609
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:57,980
mentioned the areas that I think need most support.

610
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,254
Chronic disease is something that I think we need a further investment in

611
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:07,706
maternal and child health issues and certainly youth

612
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:11,390
balance issues. But the thing

613
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,686
that also that we

614
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:17,906
need to look at are some of those wraparound services

615
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:21,934
that we need to provide to clients in order to be successful regardless

616
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:25,214
of the core program that they're accessing.

617
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:29,270
For example, for years, even in our program

618
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,790
as Chorus TV,

619
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,750
our staff had to find sources for food,

620
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,670
sometimes housing, to ensure that the clients were

621
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,638
readily accessible so that they could take their TV medicine.

622
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:47,900
And that's for the overall protection of the community.

623
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,026
I don't want to just say, yes, we need more

624
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:55,594
General Fund money, and leave you with the impression that we're

625
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:59,600
not aggressively looking for

626
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,202
increased revenue. We've been very active statewide

627
00:41:04,346 --> 00:41:07,650
looking at the transition from the 1115 waiver.

628
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,842
There is uncompensated care fund. We're trying to

629
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:15,540
maximize our ability to draw down funds on,

630
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,890
and of course, we continue to seek grants.

631
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,418
Director, I want to thank you again for your presentation. To you and your entire

632
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:33,754
team, we thank you all for all that you do. We have immense

633
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:36,954
appreciation for the work that continues,

634
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:40,766
especially during the pandemic. That was a

635
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:45,280
time of real uncertainty, in a time that we were continuously moving,

636
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,806
continuously trying to react, and from setting up the testing

637
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,302
sites to setting up the vaccine

638
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:57,458
sites, all the logistics that went on with that

639
00:41:57,624 --> 00:42:01,046
through your leadership and your entire staff and team, we want to say thank you

640
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:04,470
for all that you do. Thank you. And you were dismissed.

641
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:18,122
We have four virtual speakers and

642
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:21,862
two in person speakers. We will start with the virtual

643
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:26,110
speakers. The first is melissa Martinez,

644
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,240
please press star six.

645
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,640
Melissa Martinez, please press star six.

646
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:45,630
Geo Grocer, please press star six to unmute.

647
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:56,402
Geogroph star

648
00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:57,810
six to unmute.

649
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:08,678
Jason Oliver hello,

650
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:12,250
and thank you for the health presentation.

651
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,162
It's really concerning to kind of hear health come back year

652
00:43:17,216 --> 00:43:20,826
after year, saying that they really could do quite a

653
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,678
bit in terms of, say, chronic disease, youth violence, and maternal

654
00:43:24,694 --> 00:43:27,870
and child health with more general fund dollars.

655
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,566
I'm interested because you talked about that's, what you would prioritize in

656
00:43:31,588 --> 00:43:35,006
terms of programming. Have you priced out any programs for

657
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:37,930
these areas that could be implemented during fiscal year 2023?

658
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,220
And then second,

659
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,234
because youth violence, of course, seems like an issue that we should really care about

660
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:49,362
right now. Second, behavioral health interventions announced and approved during

661
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:53,318
last year's budget don't appear to have been implemented yet, and it sounds like

662
00:43:53,404 --> 00:43:57,010
those aren't housed there. But are those initiatives housed

663
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:01,154
within the Health Department? And then why is implementation seemingly

664
00:44:01,202 --> 00:44:04,922
delayed? I'm going to start with your

665
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:08,694
first question. Many times the priorities of the department

666
00:44:08,742 --> 00:44:12,314
is going to be led by the director of that department. So they are the

667
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:16,686
ones to identify certain programs that

668
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:20,014
they believe are beneficial, and they will put those in as line

669
00:44:20,052 --> 00:44:23,390
items for us to consider and put forth.

670
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,178
Of course, there can always be additional programs and additional dollars that

671
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:31,614
would be needed for advancing those programs,

672
00:44:31,662 --> 00:44:35,730
but that discretion remains with the director.

673
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:40,214
And your second question was my

674
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:44,194
second question was about the behavioral health interventions that were announced

675
00:44:44,242 --> 00:44:47,814
last year, right. All of the MCOT teams that were

676
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:54,186
especially important as alternative responders are

677
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:57,914
those housed within the Health Department. And then what's going

678
00:44:57,952 --> 00:45:01,446
on with the delay in implementation? Why is implementation

679
00:45:01,638 --> 00:45:05,498
taking a while? We're going

680
00:45:05,504 --> 00:45:08,526
to have to get back to you on that particular question to make sure that

681
00:45:08,548 --> 00:45:12,014
we give you the specifics. So if you want to please send

682
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:15,326
us that question via email to District E at

683
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:19,410
houst gov. We'll get back to you shortly.

684
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,780
Okay, thank you. You're welcome.

685
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,230
Amanda Psy.

686
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,874
Hi. Thank you. I'm a resident of

687
00:45:33,912 --> 00:45:37,538
District I, and I just wanted to

688
00:45:37,624 --> 00:45:40,766
echo my kind of sadness

689
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:45,346
to hear that it sounds like support for programs

690
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:48,962
that the speaker really cared about. See, to succeed,

691
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:54,822
reentry my Brother's Keeper, things like that are

692
00:45:54,876 --> 00:45:58,282
losing money. Can you share a little bit more about

693
00:45:58,336 --> 00:46:01,946
the 1115 wafer and

694
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:05,082
then yeah. Is there anything that could be done

695
00:46:05,136 --> 00:46:08,830
to help continue the support of these programs?

696
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:15,390
So the support of the programs not only come from, of course, the general fund,

697
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,246
but throughout the year, the directors do look to get

698
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:22,946
grant dollars that fund many of the programs that you were

699
00:46:22,968 --> 00:46:26,402
speaking about. As council members, we also have council district service

700
00:46:26,456 --> 00:46:30,530
funds where we work directly with the department to understand

701
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,850
their needs and identify ways in which we can support

702
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,166
specific programs that are unique to our community. So when it comes

703
00:46:38,188 --> 00:46:42,002
to reentry or first responders, I know my office has allocated

704
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:45,534
dollars towards the My Brothers Keeper program, and so that's

705
00:46:45,682 --> 00:46:49,382
ways in which we can assist and also supplement the department

706
00:46:49,446 --> 00:46:51,210
with specific programming.

707
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,540
Next is okay,

708
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,990
did you have a thank you? Okay, you will?

709
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:09,612
Yes. I also just wanted to ask

710
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:13,920
about support for domestic violence

711
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,812
programs. Are there any initiatives

712
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:21,970
that would fall under Houston Health for that?

713
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,508
I believe there are, but let us make sure that we get you a specific

714
00:47:29,594 --> 00:47:33,696
answer on that. I know that they work in collaboration with the Houston Police Department,

715
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:37,416
and many of us have an interest in ensuring that

716
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:40,804
we have dollars of programming towards domestic violence.

717
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:44,760
So please submit that answer directly to District E at Houst

718
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,960
Gov and we will respond promptly.

719
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,820
Next is Saba Blanding.

720
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,726
Hi, I wanted to follow up on that about domestic violence.

721
00:48:00,758 --> 00:48:04,474
Yesterday, Council Member Martin asked the chief of Police what we should do

722
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:08,198
about domestic violence. Then a speaker shared that they were a survivor

723
00:48:08,214 --> 00:48:12,366
of domestic violence. I did not hear anyone take the opportunity to ask them

724
00:48:12,468 --> 00:48:16,046
what would have helped them. Domestic violence is a health issue, and my

725
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:19,742
question is, what efforts is the city making to engage survivors

726
00:48:19,886 --> 00:48:23,426
in organizations such as Houston Area Women's Center to

727
00:48:23,448 --> 00:48:27,246
address interrupting domestic violence, not just once it's

728
00:48:27,278 --> 00:48:31,170
happened? And then, what is being done to specifically help support

729
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,266
the health and well being of Houstonians in possession of female reproductive organs?

730
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:38,742
According to the 2020 Report,

731
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:42,662
texas has 35 maternal deaths in 100,000.

732
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:46,674
To give some perspective, the national maternal mortality

733
00:48:46,722 --> 00:48:50,650
rate for 2020 was 23.8 deaths per 100,000

734
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,346
live births, compared with a rate of 20.1 in 2019. And of

735
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:58,414
course, there are current and upcoming restrictions to accessing abortion health care.

736
00:48:58,612 --> 00:49:02,526
Great questions as it pertains to domestic violence, I know

737
00:49:02,628 --> 00:49:06,750
within the mayor's new One Safe Houston plan, I believe he directed

738
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,330
a million dollars towards the Houston Area Women's Center,

739
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,900
and those are additional dollars that came through

740
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,754
the Cares Act, no matter of fact, ARPA dollars.

741
00:49:18,952 --> 00:49:22,870
And so that's one way in which we as a council are trying to assist

742
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:27,186
with providing more resources on domestic violence.

743
00:49:27,218 --> 00:49:30,120
But I believe council Member Cayman, did you want to chime in?

744
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:34,998
PABA, thank you for the question. And this is just a few examples, and we'd

745
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:38,390
be happy to follow up. I think the city is trying to leverage

746
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:42,518
all community partners, not just City of Houston, including the Harris

747
00:49:42,534 --> 00:49:46,334
County Domestic Violence Coordinating Council going back

748
00:49:46,372 --> 00:49:52,862
to COVID, and I can speak from COVID on right, the no

749
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:56,334
COVID abuse program. So what we found is with

750
00:49:56,372 --> 00:50:00,226
domestic abuse, a lot of survivors were trapped at

751
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:02,750
home with their families. Motion to extend.

752
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:06,754
Sure. So the city launched and

753
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:10,454
brought together community partners to launch that,

754
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:13,522
working with Hawk to do online reporting,

755
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:17,058
texting services, anything to get the word out and also educate

756
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:22,274
and help. But in addition to that, the mayor added in into

757
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:26,282
the Office of Human Trafficking, a specific charge now

758
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:29,498
also to include domestic violence in that. So that is now in

759
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:34,282
the mayor's office as a permanent office.

760
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:38,266
In addition to that, throughout COVID, the additional housing funding

761
00:50:38,298 --> 00:50:41,840
that we provided. Right. So you have the issues with

762
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,370
housing during the pandemic, you can't keep everyone in a shelter and

763
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:51,054
there was an increased need. So city funding,

764
00:50:51,102 --> 00:50:55,106
council funding, hotels, additional services,

765
00:50:55,288 --> 00:50:58,386
job training that was actually launched, partnerships to

766
00:50:58,408 --> 00:51:01,830
actually train people. Because one of the things that happens with domestic violence,

767
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,466
you end up in a cycle because you are dependent on that abuser

768
00:51:06,578 --> 00:51:10,678
financially. So the city is actually starting to focus on job training

769
00:51:10,764 --> 00:51:13,980
programs. And we can get you more information on that.

770
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:19,062
There's a whole list of things, but that's just a few examples,

771
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:23,654
not just the immediate response, immediate funding to Dart HPD,

772
00:51:23,782 --> 00:51:27,562
but the holistic approach

773
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,720
that the city is trying to take in addressing the issue.

774
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:35,066
Are you also studying this within your Women's commission?

775
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,586
Is this one of the action items

776
00:51:38,618 --> 00:51:42,018
that you all are looking at? I can't speak for the

777
00:51:42,024 --> 00:51:45,566
Women's Commission because, again, that's an independent commission under the charge

778
00:51:45,598 --> 00:51:49,074
of the mayor. But I do believe they are looking at that issue as well.

779
00:51:49,112 --> 00:51:53,058
It's remaining at the forefront in a multitude

780
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:56,614
of ways. And then the city is supporting Houston Area

781
00:51:56,652 --> 00:51:59,874
Women's Center in their expansion of their new campus.

782
00:51:59,922 --> 00:52:02,200
That's going to be in District D,

783
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:06,522
but there's a lot of extraordinary work

784
00:52:06,576 --> 00:52:09,722
happening in that space. Great, thank you.

785
00:52:09,776 --> 00:52:10,940
Thank you for your questions,

786
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,810
Mr. Broderick butler.

787
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,314
My name is Broderick Butler. I'm from northeast Houston. I respect

788
00:52:24,362 --> 00:52:28,110
the health director's detailed responses to numerous members

789
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,394
of council. It would have been nice if he could have done the same

790
00:52:31,432 --> 00:52:34,802
for the four public speakers. But if I

791
00:52:34,856 --> 00:52:38,002
were here to ask him, I'd like to know from that list

792
00:52:38,056 --> 00:52:41,518
that he gave us with all the red lettering, what his priorities

793
00:52:41,614 --> 00:52:44,854
would be. So if you want to put yourself in his shoes and tell me

794
00:52:44,892 --> 00:52:48,626
what his priorities would be for funding for the unfunded

795
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:52,086
projects that he has, I would love to hear that. Lastly, I'd like to make

796
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:55,494
a statement. I would like to acknowledge my council member,

797
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:59,126
Tossa Jackson, today. She stood 10ft tall

798
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:02,346
for me because she embodied the saying that the only

799
00:53:02,368 --> 00:53:05,742
thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good

800
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:09,920
men and women to do nothing. Thank you.

801
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:14,320
Thank you. No answer.

802
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,366
I didn't hear a question in any of that. I said to give me the

803
00:53:18,388 --> 00:53:22,082
priorities from the list of the unfunded things the health director show.

804
00:53:22,136 --> 00:53:25,742
No, you said to put ourselves in the shoes of the director.

805
00:53:25,806 --> 00:53:29,346
You guys are answering the questions. If you would like

806
00:53:29,368 --> 00:53:32,998
to ask us directly. We asked detailed questions of each of you,

807
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:36,230
gave detailed answers to each of you to the questions

808
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,166
you gave. We didn't have that opportunity. So since he

809
00:53:40,188 --> 00:53:41,160
is not here,

810
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,942
we can't talk over each other. So if you could give me these answers

811
00:53:48,086 --> 00:53:51,354
for the list of the top priorities he would have

812
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:55,002
to choose from off that list of unfunded things,

813
00:53:55,136 --> 00:53:58,510
I would appreciate it. If you can't, you can't. If you can, you can.

814
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,606
Directors report to the mayor. We as council members, report to

815
00:54:02,628 --> 00:54:06,158
the public. So if you have a question for us, then you

816
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:09,754
can give that to us. Now. We can take your question and submit

817
00:54:09,802 --> 00:54:13,522
that over to the director to provide an answer to you from his

818
00:54:13,576 --> 00:54:16,834
standpoint, but we're not going to step in his shoes. And the

819
00:54:16,872 --> 00:54:20,642
reason in which you all are speaking to us as a council is

820
00:54:20,696 --> 00:54:24,678
because we report to you. The directors report to

821
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:28,710
the mayor in his administration, and so they were asked to leave,

822
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:32,422
and that's why their questions are being reported to us from the public. Okay?

823
00:54:32,476 --> 00:54:35,798
So if you have a direct question to us, we can answer. If not,

824
00:54:35,884 --> 00:54:39,018
if the question is for the director, we will submit for you,

825
00:54:39,104 --> 00:54:42,154
and then we will provide their response. I'm not here to talk to you.

826
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:45,326
I'm here to talk to the director. So therefore, there's a

827
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:48,542
flaw in that logic of who I provide

828
00:54:48,596 --> 00:54:52,366
the question to. He answered detailed questions

829
00:54:52,548 --> 00:54:56,478
from you, and he couldn't do the same for us because

830
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:59,966
he was dismissed. So therefore, that is a

831
00:54:59,988 --> 00:55:03,346
flaw in this whole process. And I didn't want to

832
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:06,514
go here, but since we are, that's a flaw in this

833
00:55:06,552 --> 00:55:09,938
process. Each of these individuals that have stood before us are

834
00:55:10,024 --> 00:55:14,134
compensated very well. And the question previously that I wanted to

835
00:55:14,172 --> 00:55:17,510
say that the airport director said he gave

836
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,834
a sterling list of people that he lost.

837
00:55:20,962 --> 00:55:25,190
But you know what I would have said to him? Competency gets compensation.

838
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,686
And you're supposed to build up people that leave you

839
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:33,266
and go to different departments in different countries and different sections

840
00:55:33,378 --> 00:55:37,166
and exemplary and show that I was produced by the

841
00:55:37,188 --> 00:55:40,334
Houston airport system. So that's what I would have said

842
00:55:40,372 --> 00:55:44,142
to him. It's sad, but next man

843
00:55:44,196 --> 00:55:46,480
up. Thank you, sir.

844
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:54,190
We have no more public speakers. And that concludes our health

845
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,170
department presentation.
