WEBVTT

00:04.170 --> 00:07.726
The fire department presentations. Reminder to council members you

00:07.748 --> 00:10.894
should submit any department budget workshop questions in a word

00:10.932 --> 00:14.234
document and upload it to SharePoint budget

00:14.282 --> 00:18.734
workspace. Departments have been directed to provide responses within 48

00:18.772 --> 00:22.522
hours of the conclusion of their presentations. Department responses

00:22.586 --> 00:26.274
will also be uploaded to SharePoint. We will now hear from Chief Pena,

00:26.322 --> 00:29.954
who will provide the fire Department budget. Chief floor is yours.

00:30.082 --> 00:34.006
Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. First of all, I want to thank you.

00:34.028 --> 00:37.526
I want to thank the committee members for allowing me to present the

00:37.628 --> 00:41.430
Houston Fire Department's proposed fiscal year 2023 budget.

00:41.590 --> 00:44.934
Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge some of my civilian staff

00:44.982 --> 00:48.154
and of course, my command staff for the

00:48.192 --> 00:51.454
assistance that they provided in preparing this budget. With me.

00:51.492 --> 00:55.226
I have the Houston Fire Department's department fiscal

00:55.258 --> 00:59.038
administrator, Ms. Rochelle McHenry. I also have members of

00:59.044 --> 01:02.334
my command staff here. Chief west and Chief McLeod are

01:02.372 --> 01:05.898
joining us. But the

01:05.924 --> 01:09.602
thanks goes to all our staff who really have been

01:09.656 --> 01:13.634
doing tremendous work. I also want to acknowledge and thank Mayor Turner and this

01:13.672 --> 01:17.560
council for giving me the support this year and the finances to

01:18.330 --> 01:21.430
provide the needs for this organization.

01:21.850 --> 01:25.666
The Houston Fire Department is the third largest municipal

01:25.698 --> 01:28.566
fire department, protecting the fourth largest city in the country.

01:28.748 --> 01:32.146
And my hat goes off to the men and women of the Houston

01:32.178 --> 01:35.002
Fire Department for the incredible work that they do each and every day.

01:35.136 --> 01:39.562
It's an active system, just like any major city. We run about 344,000

01:39.616 --> 01:43.226
calls for service each year. We're still dealing with

01:43.248 --> 01:47.230
the effects of the pandemic and working

01:47.300 --> 01:50.718
through some very challenging times. But I cannot say enough about the work that the

01:50.724 --> 01:53.938
men and women of the Houston Fire Department do to ensure the safety of

01:53.944 --> 01:57.380
this community. So very proud of the work that they do.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.060
First slide, please.

02:03.030 --> 02:06.226
So the proposed fiscal year 2023 budget for the

02:06.248 --> 02:09.160
Houston Fire Department is $559,000,000.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.782
This will be funding 3933.3

02:13.836 --> 02:17.746
FTEs in six funds. The distribution of the funds and

02:17.788 --> 02:22.118
the personnel are displayed here in six key areas.

02:22.214 --> 02:26.342
And as you can see, the major funding is for personnel

02:26.486 --> 02:30.490
that is allocated to the emergency response program. Next slide.

02:33.310 --> 02:36.958
Our primary function and mission is the protection of lives and property

02:37.044 --> 02:40.798
of our residents. Our goal is to accomplish this primarily through

02:40.964 --> 02:45.122
prevention, code enforcement and investigations. But we do

02:45.256 --> 02:48.818
spend a lot of money to train and prepare for responses to

02:48.984 --> 02:51.934
emergency medical calls, fire calls,

02:51.982 --> 02:55.714
hazmat, technical rescue, aircraft rescue, and a variety

02:55.762 --> 02:58.070
of other programs. Next slide.

03:01.450 --> 03:04.834
The legal provisions that guide our agency and approve

03:04.882 --> 03:08.230
programs and services for our department are listed here on this slide.

03:08.810 --> 03:12.714
I do want to highlight the last bullet point in the anticipation of

03:12.752 --> 03:16.234
increased demand in service for our department. This is

03:16.272 --> 03:19.818
particularly going to be in the area of emergency medical services.

03:19.984 --> 03:23.166
The population growth, and especially the aging population will

03:23.188 --> 03:27.098
drive up the need for our services. The same thing will occur

03:27.274 --> 03:31.162
with the aging infrastructure as it relates to fire response.

03:31.306 --> 03:35.362
So it is critical, and it's more important now more than ever

03:35.496 --> 03:39.630
that we maintain focus of adopting appropriate

03:39.710 --> 03:43.234
fire codes and enforcement tools to maintain the desired quality of life

03:43.272 --> 03:44.980
here in the city. Next slide, please.

03:47.370 --> 03:50.914
So, as we move on to the financials of our presentation, this first slide

03:50.962 --> 03:54.806
summarizes the department's revenue projections for the general fund.

03:54.988 --> 03:58.646
In fiscal year 23, we're projecting a slight increase in the majority

03:58.678 --> 04:02.138
of our regular operating revenue streams. This is going to

04:02.144 --> 04:05.674
be offset by a larger decrease in three specific

04:05.792 --> 04:09.162
revenue accounts. So the overall net effect for

04:09.296 --> 04:12.974
our revenues is a decrease of 7.73%,

04:13.092 --> 04:16.746
or $8.9 million, from fiscal year 22 to fiscal

04:16.778 --> 04:20.506
year 23. For our department, the revenue

04:20.538 --> 04:24.846
is derived primarily from licensings and permits intergovernmental

04:24.878 --> 04:28.754
revenue. This is in addition to

04:28.792 --> 04:31.730
charges for services or ambulance transports.

04:32.150 --> 04:35.826
Direct inner funds. This is the money that we receive from Haas for personnel

04:35.858 --> 04:40.070
assigned to the airport stations. The miscellaneous

04:40.970 --> 04:44.754
item, the category, is primarily the reimbursement

04:44.802 --> 04:48.650
for our special operations teams and their deployments.

04:48.990 --> 04:52.630
So licenses and permits are essentially flat.

04:52.790 --> 04:56.342
This year is our projection with a slight increase in the expected fire permit

04:56.406 --> 04:59.802
revenue. We're also projecting a 39%

04:59.936 --> 05:03.374
reduction in the intergovernmental category due to

05:03.412 --> 05:07.338
an increase primarily to the amount of money we're going to receive

05:07.434 --> 05:11.438
from the ambulance supplemental payment program. And I'll explain more

05:11.524 --> 05:15.638
in a later slide. The charges for service increase

05:15.674 --> 05:19.394
is primarily due to the expected increase in Hazmat permits, which will bring us

05:19.432 --> 05:23.518
back to the pre pandemic revenue figures. This is going to be offset

05:23.694 --> 05:26.870
against a decrease in cell phone revenue towers.

05:28.010 --> 05:31.826
This is the lease money that we get from Verizon for allowing

05:31.858 --> 05:34.550
them to put their cell towers on the fire stations.

05:36.570 --> 05:40.214
In the direct interfund services, this is the chargeback

05:40.262 --> 05:44.486
for Haas. Again, for airport firefighters, the change reflects

05:44.518 --> 05:48.202
a 6% base pay raise offset against

05:48.256 --> 05:51.354
a lower pension rate for this account,

05:51.552 --> 05:54.926
for other fines and forfeits the amount from fiscal year

05:54.948 --> 05:58.394
22 is essentially flat. In the miscellaneous

05:58.442 --> 06:01.646
and other categories, the change from budget to estimate is

06:01.668 --> 06:05.778
a decrease of ten point 43%.

06:05.944 --> 06:09.486
This is going to be primarily due to an expected decrease in the natural disaster

06:09.518 --> 06:13.858
reimbursement. Again, for for deployments in fiscal year 21 and 22,

06:14.024 --> 06:17.554
the tactical deployment of the Texas Task Force

06:17.602 --> 06:20.834
One members. They were deployed higher than normal,

06:20.882 --> 06:24.680
and we don't expect the same number of deployments this fiscal year.

06:25.130 --> 06:28.882
In other resources, we captured the revenue associated with the Enterprise

06:28.946 --> 06:32.134
Light duty lease program for our light duty vehicles,

06:32.182 --> 06:35.914
and I have a slide that will go more in depth a little bit

06:35.952 --> 06:39.526
later. So again, the fiscal year 23 projection

06:39.558 --> 06:44.862
revenue of $107.4 million is approximately 7.73%

06:44.996 --> 06:48.174
less than fiscal year 2022s.

06:48.372 --> 06:51.946
Again, I want to stress the point that this is mainly due to the ambulance

06:51.978 --> 06:55.842
supplemental payment program which will be reduced, and I'll explain more

06:55.976 --> 06:57.620
on this. Next slide, please.

06:59.830 --> 07:03.874
So, as mentioned, the supplemental reimbursement program is

07:03.912 --> 07:07.240
expected to drop by about $9.5 million.

07:08.090 --> 07:11.618
This fund provides for the reimbursement for care, for Medicaid

07:11.634 --> 07:15.302
and indigent care patients. So as of October 1,

07:15.356 --> 07:19.270
2019, the uncompensated care program transitioned

07:19.350 --> 07:23.046
to a charity care pool. This change eliminated

07:23.078 --> 07:27.034
the Medicaid shortfall supplemental program, and it

07:27.072 --> 07:30.650
redefined it as an uninsured cost to charity care

07:30.720 --> 07:34.000
cost. Okay. That's the significant change.

07:35.170 --> 07:38.574
This required agencies to have

07:38.612 --> 07:42.478
a charity care policy in place. The first year,

07:42.564 --> 07:45.714
very few providers were able to get that policy in place.

07:45.832 --> 07:49.506
The Houston Fire Department. The City of Houston actually did. So we were one

07:49.528 --> 07:53.026
of the few participants in the pool. This second year,

07:53.208 --> 07:56.546
more providers are able to have that policy in place.

07:56.648 --> 08:00.920
So we have more agencies competing with the same

08:01.450 --> 08:04.918
pool. So the number of dollars in the

08:04.924 --> 08:08.346
pool did not increase, but the number of participants did. So the

08:08.368 --> 08:12.150
disbursement was a little less to every provider.

08:12.310 --> 08:16.250
That's essentially the high level explanation on why we're getting a lower return

08:16.320 --> 08:19.020
this year. Next slide, please.

08:22.690 --> 08:26.170
Okay. This is the Vehicle

08:26.250 --> 08:29.678
Lease program. So this program has allowed us to do a

08:29.684 --> 08:32.726
wholesale replacement of our vehicles, the light duty vehicles,

08:32.778 --> 08:36.754
primarily in the Life Safety Bureau, and we

08:36.792 --> 08:40.482
are in the first replacement cycle for that

08:40.616 --> 08:44.542
program. The program we incorporated

08:44.606 --> 08:49.462
105 vehicles in the lease program this

08:49.516 --> 08:52.982
year. We were supposed to sell that one year old

08:53.036 --> 08:56.130
vehicle, 105 of them, and get new vehicles.

08:56.210 --> 08:59.610
The money that was realized from that sale was going to go back

08:59.760 --> 09:03.498
reprogrammed into the program. Because of supply chain issues,

09:03.664 --> 09:06.742
we were only able to sell 49 vehicles.

09:06.886 --> 09:10.394
So, as you can see, the disbursement was

09:10.432 --> 09:13.614
$563,000 for those

09:13.652 --> 09:16.990
vehicles. Enterprise what they did is they gave us

09:17.060 --> 09:20.606
65% of the equity in those

09:20.628 --> 09:23.914
vehicles. They paid it out this year for next fiscal

09:23.962 --> 09:28.206
year, we will sell again those 49 one year old vehicles,

09:28.318 --> 09:31.810
plus 56 vehicles that now will be two years old.

09:31.880 --> 09:35.766
And we'll realize only the 35% equity that was left over.

09:35.868 --> 09:40.150
That's the reason for the change

09:40.300 --> 09:43.958
in the revenue. But essentially, as you

09:43.964 --> 09:47.894
can see, the first year we realized, to the

09:48.012 --> 09:51.162
benefit of the city is $391,000.

09:51.296 --> 09:55.900
We replaced 105 vehicles. The program really,

09:56.270 --> 09:59.242
it was essentially cost neutral. Matter of fact,

09:59.376 --> 10:03.562
the city was reimbursed an additional 395 or $91,000

10:03.696 --> 10:07.374
fiscal year 23. Our projection is going to be about half

10:07.412 --> 10:11.114
of that. Again, because of the explanation that I gave earlier, we're selling two euro

10:11.162 --> 10:14.562
vehicles instead of €1 vehicles. After this year,

10:14.616 --> 10:17.394
we will be back on track to sell,

10:17.512 --> 10:21.154
replace 105, and sell 105 every year.

10:21.352 --> 10:22.370
Next slide.

10:25.590 --> 10:28.690
These are expenditures by funds. The proposed expenditure

10:28.770 --> 10:32.278
target for fiscal year 23 is $559,000,000,

10:32.444 --> 10:35.846
which represents an increase of 20.3 million

10:35.948 --> 10:39.014
from the current budget of $538.7

10:39.052 --> 10:42.962
million. The increase by category

10:43.026 --> 10:47.114
and personnel cost is a net of several increases including civilian and

10:47.152 --> 10:51.218
classified base and related fringes, as well as classified overtime

10:51.254 --> 10:55.130
and classified health. This will be offset against a decrease in the classified

10:55.210 --> 10:59.120
pension and classified workers comp cost.

10:59.490 --> 11:02.846
A 10.9% increase in supplies is due to an increase

11:02.878 --> 11:06.434
in cost of doing business, primarily in

11:06.472 --> 11:10.526
drugs, medical surgical supplies, as well as a small increase

11:10.558 --> 11:14.002
for the GL account for the fifth Academy class

11:14.056 --> 11:17.640
that we were approved for this coming fiscal year.

11:18.090 --> 11:21.906
Contributing to the overall 3.77% growth is an increase

11:21.938 --> 11:25.878
in our restricted accounts of eleven point 61%.

11:26.044 --> 11:29.594
This is the Interfund chargeback accounts for It

11:29.712 --> 11:32.380
for HR, fuel and fleet services.

11:33.630 --> 11:37.962
And lastly, an increase in our service account of $958,000

11:38.016 --> 11:41.486
is a transfer of funds from GST for the payment of our

11:41.508 --> 11:44.110
lease for our building, for our headquarters.

11:44.610 --> 11:47.866
This is in addition to that, it's an increase in other inner

11:47.898 --> 11:51.722
fund services for payments of It service personnel.

11:51.866 --> 11:55.726
Contractual increases which will be offset again by a decreasing

11:55.758 --> 12:00.046
in billing and collection expenditure from our medical

12:00.078 --> 12:03.470
biller because of the reduced amount in the ASPP

12:03.550 --> 12:07.374
fund, the ambulance supplemental plan. The equipment

12:07.422 --> 12:10.966
fund change is due to not requiring us to invest

12:11.068 --> 12:14.806
this year for items that were purchased in fiscal year 21 and 22.

12:14.908 --> 12:18.342
In 21 we purchased some surface pro tablets,

12:18.406 --> 12:22.358
some related equipment, some desktops and three thermal imagers.

12:22.454 --> 12:26.006
In fiscal year 22, those expenditures were directed

12:26.038 --> 12:29.446
towards extrication equipment, jobs of life and those types

12:29.478 --> 12:33.214
of equipment. We will not have to make that purchase this year. That's the reason

12:33.252 --> 12:36.814
for the change. As far

12:36.852 --> 12:40.574
as the explanation for the Debt services fund, in fiscal year

12:40.612 --> 12:44.722
21, $53,000 was transferred from Fund 1000 to

12:44.776 --> 12:48.898
Fund 40 515. This was done for the purchase of

12:48.984 --> 12:51.620
drone equipment for our tactical deployment team.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.366
We ran out of time actually to get that purchase done before

12:55.388 --> 12:59.446
the end of the fiscal year. So we did receive approval to transfer

12:59.548 --> 13:03.910
the funds that were allocated from District G's service

13:03.980 --> 13:07.910
funds to Fund 40 515.

13:07.980 --> 13:11.482
That way we wouldn't lose that budget. That's the explanation for that.

13:11.536 --> 13:15.206
Next slide please. So this is how our funds

13:15.238 --> 13:18.470
are allocated. Of the fiscal year 23 budget,

13:18.630 --> 13:21.280
88% is allocated to Personnel services.

13:21.650 --> 13:26.046
This leaves a total operating budget of $69.5 million,

13:26.228 --> 13:29.390
of which 63% or

13:29.460 --> 13:33.106
45 point or $43.5 million is in

13:33.128 --> 13:36.414
restricted accounts. This is for HR.

13:36.462 --> 13:39.170
Interfunds fleet interfunds and so on.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.690
17% is in the other category. This is for

13:42.840 --> 13:47.298
certain contracts, our telemetry contract and other service contracts.

13:47.474 --> 13:51.110
6% is allocated for our billing and collections agency,

13:52.090 --> 13:55.778
which leaves us approximately $10.2 million annually

13:55.874 --> 13:59.462
to cover medical supplies, to cover personal protective equipment,

13:59.526 --> 14:03.194
firefighting equipment and other supplies needed for the operation of this

14:03.232 --> 14:06.460
organization. Next slide please.

14:08.830 --> 14:12.682
So this slide walks us through the changes from fiscal year 22 current

14:12.736 --> 14:16.266
budget to fiscal year 2023 proposed budget. Our fiscal

14:16.298 --> 14:20.302
year 22 current budget is $538.7 million,

14:20.436 --> 14:24.350
of which 36.8 million is in restricted accounts.

14:24.510 --> 14:27.874
The 22 current budget figure of 538

14:27.912 --> 14:30.930
is a net adjustment for fiscal year 22.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.134
Hope contractual adjustments. It includes restricted accounts increases

14:35.182 --> 14:38.546
of $2.2 million, some health benefit returns

14:38.578 --> 14:41.794
of $3.8 million, and a city council surplus

14:41.842 --> 14:45.426
dollars of $29,000. Other operating contractual

14:45.458 --> 14:49.194
adjustments of 4.7 million includes one time adjustments for

14:49.232 --> 14:52.982
workers compensation increases, overtime expenditures,

14:53.126 --> 14:56.902
which are then offset by classified and cadet vacancy savings.

14:56.966 --> 15:00.974
So the total adjustment, the one time adjustment for this is $3.3

15:01.012 --> 15:04.462
million. So to go from 22 to

15:04.516 --> 15:08.154
23 budget, we have incremental increases and decreases in operating

15:08.202 --> 15:11.550
and contractually mandated expenses.

15:12.210 --> 15:15.582
And I'll explain here. So coming back into the budget

15:15.646 --> 15:19.278
is $2.75 million for our fifth academy

15:19.294 --> 15:23.202
class that was approved funding for a 6% across

15:23.256 --> 15:27.166
the board pay raise for classified personnel, other classified adjustments

15:27.198 --> 15:30.226
of $2.4 million for base overtime,

15:30.418 --> 15:34.006
a return of the council surplus dollars, and a reversal of

15:34.028 --> 15:37.270
the one time operating adjustments for a total of three. I'm sorry.

15:37.340 --> 15:41.370
$21.3 million in adjustments or a 4.26

15:41.440 --> 15:45.254
increase from FY 22 to FY

15:45.382 --> 15:49.046
23. The contractual

15:49.078 --> 15:52.830
obligations include the following hope obligations

15:53.170 --> 15:56.430
contractual obligations adjustments for civilian and

15:56.500 --> 16:00.766
classified health, civilian and classified pension and FICA and

16:00.868 --> 16:04.574
other funding or restricted accounts, contract, Escalations,

16:04.622 --> 16:08.654
and other contractual adjustments. So the subtotal of contractual

16:08.702 --> 16:12.306
obligations is -920 $6,000,

16:12.408 --> 16:15.714
which is largely the result of savings related to the reduction in the

16:15.752 --> 16:19.250
classified pension rate, the operating

16:19.410 --> 16:23.414
contractual obligation adjustments of $20.3 million, which takes

16:23.452 --> 16:28.442
us to our fiscal year 23 proposed budget of $559,000,000,

16:28.496 --> 16:32.810
or a 3.77% increase from 20. Two's current budget.

16:34.030 --> 16:37.514
Next slide, please. So,

16:37.712 --> 16:41.702
these are the highlights of the materials we just covered. Of additional

16:41.766 --> 16:45.594
focus, I'd like to mention the five non certified

16:45.642 --> 16:49.134
cadet training classes for a total of 350 new

16:49.172 --> 16:53.558
hires for fiscal year 23, and the cost associated

16:53.754 --> 16:57.166
for the continuation of three non certified classes,

16:57.198 --> 16:59.620
which were begun this fiscal year.

17:00.630 --> 17:04.370
In addition to that is a grant match for the AFG grant to provide

17:04.440 --> 17:08.322
training and physicals with cancer screenings for firefighters

17:08.386 --> 17:11.346
and also the completion of our vehicle exhaust installation.

17:11.458 --> 17:13.398
That grant matches approximately $309,000.

17:13.404 --> 17:18.406
And then

17:18.428 --> 17:21.660
we discussed the other ones already. So next slide, please.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.634
That is my presentation vice Chair. I am open for any

17:26.672 --> 17:30.746
questions. Thank you, Chief, for your presentation, I'm going to start with questions from

17:30.768 --> 17:34.990
Council member Abby Cayman. Thank you so much, Vice Chair.

17:35.490 --> 17:38.974
Chief, thank you for not only to you, to your

17:39.012 --> 17:42.394
executive team command all the way on down. It's a privilege

17:42.442 --> 17:46.610
to work with you all. Thank you. Few quick questions. As I said, I'm asking

17:46.680 --> 17:50.494
this of every department. Given the budgetary

17:50.542 --> 17:53.726
and financial constraints that the city continues to face due

17:53.758 --> 17:57.270
to revenue limitations,

17:58.730 --> 18:01.880
what can we not afford right now

18:02.650 --> 18:06.466
that's needed? That's not to say that mayor and council

18:06.498 --> 18:11.162
is not trying to approve everything that we can, but there are significant large

18:11.216 --> 18:15.238
budget items that are necessary that we, quite frankly, can't afford.

18:15.334 --> 18:18.954
Such as I'll say it, and I know council Member Peck will probably raise it.

18:18.992 --> 18:22.986
CAD I'm looking back in the appendix

18:23.178 --> 18:26.778
diesel exhaust removal for some of our stations.

18:26.954 --> 18:30.334
Are there other things that we

18:30.372 --> 18:33.618
need to be talking about

18:33.704 --> 18:36.580
that we cannot necessarily afford right now?

18:37.270 --> 18:40.386
Council Member the answer to that question is definitely a

18:40.408 --> 18:44.286
yes. You mentioned technology is a critical

18:44.398 --> 18:47.918
need for our organization. The computer aided dispatcher

18:47.934 --> 18:51.446
CAD system needs complete replacement on that.

18:51.468 --> 18:54.678
We're working with almost a 20 year old system, and there are a

18:54.684 --> 18:58.598
lot of things that we could be doing to create efficiencies within the organization

18:58.774 --> 19:02.410
that are not possible because of the age of that program.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.718
One of them is dispatching by location,

19:05.894 --> 19:09.594
vehicle location, text to 911.

19:09.712 --> 19:13.386
All those priority dispatch systems, all those

19:13.408 --> 19:17.022
things that we can explore are a little bit more difficult

19:17.076 --> 19:19.966
because of the age of that system. So technology is one of them.

19:20.148 --> 19:23.426
The other needs are going to be primarily focused on training and

19:23.448 --> 19:26.770
professional development for the members of the organization.

19:27.350 --> 19:30.014
An increase in service capacity,

19:30.142 --> 19:33.746
primarily ambulance and transport service capacity is

19:33.768 --> 19:37.094
what we need, and there are a lot of needs for

19:37.212 --> 19:39.030
upgrades in our facilities.

19:41.130 --> 19:43.960
I need you to put me back in queue. I had one more question.

19:44.970 --> 19:48.378
You have one more. Go ahead. Okay, thank you. And again, Chief, I do want

19:48.384 --> 19:52.326
to congratulate you on in the department on the things you have accomplished.

19:52.358 --> 19:56.054
Again, going back to the appendix, the increase

19:56.102 --> 19:59.078
in pay, the Hazmat units,

19:59.174 --> 20:02.894
the following up on 100%

20:02.932 --> 20:06.222
of cardiac arrest incidents, adoption of the fire code,

20:06.276 --> 20:10.126
the lease vehicle program. There's a

20:10.148 --> 20:13.646
lot in here that is absolutely to be commended

20:13.678 --> 20:17.220
for. I do want to point out I continue when we look at the

20:17.750 --> 20:20.610
comparative gender and ethnicity statistics,

20:21.190 --> 20:24.910
the very low level in terms of classified of

20:25.000 --> 20:28.422
female employees. Yes. And that's it, I think

20:28.476 --> 20:32.390
3.85% compared to 96.15%

20:32.540 --> 20:35.942
in the largest population of

20:36.076 --> 20:40.006
HFD employees. So I would just bring our attention to that. In terms

20:40.028 --> 20:44.140
of recruitment, I know that there are recruitment challenges that we continue to face,

20:44.830 --> 20:48.758
but I know that we are striving to be as diverse

20:48.774 --> 20:51.974
as possible, and I see that reflected in Y'all's efforts.

20:52.022 --> 20:55.614
But I just wanted to point that out that we have more work

20:55.652 --> 20:59.070
to do there. And if you could really quickly touch base on you

20:59.140 --> 21:03.154
kind of touched on it, but our inspection capacity and

21:03.192 --> 21:07.058
our ambulance transport capacity I know you just mentioned

21:07.144 --> 21:10.226
it, but inspection capacity seems to be a

21:10.248 --> 21:13.330
pretty big need. Yes, ma'am.

21:13.670 --> 21:17.534
Look, if we focus all our attention and resources

21:17.582 --> 21:21.046
on just the emergency response, we're never going to be able to keep up with

21:21.068 --> 21:24.534
demand. We're going to make the biggest impact in

21:24.572 --> 21:28.298
our call volume and demand if we prevent things

21:28.384 --> 21:31.626
from happening. That speaks to

21:31.728 --> 21:35.546
our need to provide more inspections for

21:35.568 --> 21:39.306
these commercial businesses. Having more inspectors to ensure that

21:39.328 --> 21:43.226
the codes, when we're building, we're building appropriately and

21:43.248 --> 21:46.586
up to code and having those eyes on scene to ensure

21:46.618 --> 21:50.250
that we are meeting those codes because it's going to assist us downstream

21:50.330 --> 21:53.422
in not having to respond to so many fires or major fires.

21:53.486 --> 21:56.530
The same thing goes for medical response.

21:57.830 --> 22:01.650
25% of our basic life support calls

22:02.070 --> 22:05.714
are people that call more than once or twice per

22:05.752 --> 22:09.794
year. Okay? And what we found is that those individuals

22:09.922 --> 22:13.442
don't need the most expensive taxi to go to the most expensive

22:13.506 --> 22:16.966
part of the Er. They need access to the right social service. Right. We have

22:16.988 --> 22:20.774
that information. It's having resources to

22:20.892 --> 22:24.874
focus on those social services and making

22:24.912 --> 22:28.634
those connections with existing agencies that's going to allow us

22:28.672 --> 22:31.934
to make a definite impact on the number of calls that

22:31.972 --> 22:35.374
come in from repeat customers. Let me say it that way.

22:35.572 --> 22:39.374
So certainly inspectors and then we know

22:39.412 --> 22:43.194
that we have an increase in population and increase in aging population

22:43.322 --> 22:47.006
and whether we like it or not, we are the medical safety

22:47.038 --> 22:50.894
net for this community. So emergency medical transport

22:50.942 --> 22:54.754
and ambulance service is what we need to focus on right now.

22:54.792 --> 22:58.102
We're limited in our ability to increase that because of our

22:58.156 --> 23:01.670
staffing situation. But strategically that's something

23:01.740 --> 23:05.138
that we've discussed with the mayor and administration.

23:05.234 --> 23:08.586
The mayor is completely supportive of doing that.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.766
We just need to fix the staffing

23:11.798 --> 23:13.500
issue first and then we can move forward.

23:16.030 --> 23:18.650
Chief, when looking at your presentation,

23:20.370 --> 23:23.678
can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that you had an

23:23.844 --> 23:27.310
increase in expenditures but a decrease in revenues.

23:29.410 --> 23:33.490
Yes. What creative ways can we increase revenues

23:33.910 --> 23:37.986
within the department? Other ways to increase revenues in the department of

23:38.008 --> 23:42.366
course. Look, the major revenue

23:42.398 --> 23:46.170
source is our charge for service and primarily

23:46.350 --> 23:47.560
ambulance service.

23:49.690 --> 23:52.930
We brought forth a recommendation for an ordinance,

23:53.010 --> 23:56.280
an increase in the charge a couple of years ago.

23:56.730 --> 24:00.266
That recommendation was based on data that was

24:00.288 --> 24:03.580
already a couple of years old at that time.

24:03.950 --> 24:07.082
Since then we've had an increase of

24:07.136 --> 24:10.794
6% pay raise last year. We are

24:10.832 --> 24:14.622
going to have a 6% increase this coming year. And so

24:14.676 --> 24:18.442
the cost of delivering service has gone up not only in personnel

24:18.506 --> 24:22.426
cost but also the cost of supplies and materials.

24:22.538 --> 24:26.466
In one particular drug that we use the

24:26.488 --> 24:30.114
cost went up almost 90%. Right. And so everything

24:30.232 --> 24:34.020
is going up. We are not

24:35.350 --> 24:39.266
recovering what it cost us to deliver. So we need to another analysis,

24:39.298 --> 24:43.014
another study to see what that rate would be. Second thing

24:43.052 --> 24:46.114
is our payer mix is heavy medicare,

24:46.162 --> 24:49.594
Medicaid in this community. And then we have a

24:49.632 --> 24:53.194
large percentage of self pay which means no

24:53.232 --> 24:56.778
insurance. So our collection rate is about 39%

24:56.784 --> 24:57.740
to 40%.

25:01.490 --> 25:05.370
At some point medicare or Medicaid is expanded.

25:05.530 --> 25:10.106
We would have the ability to collect

25:10.218 --> 25:13.940
more. Increasing the rate of

25:14.310 --> 25:18.126
service cost or the charge

25:18.158 --> 25:21.554
for service would be one way because medicare and Medicaid they

25:21.592 --> 25:25.686
reimbursed at the usual and customary rate. We are

25:25.868 --> 25:28.822
the big elephant in the room.

25:28.956 --> 25:32.162
We are the largest ambulance provider in this region,

25:32.306 --> 25:35.800
so if we keep our rates arbitrarily low,

25:36.250 --> 25:40.146
there is no incentive for that reimbursement

25:40.178 --> 25:44.086
for Medicare, Medicaid to be adjusted upward. So we have

25:44.108 --> 25:47.442
to look at some of these things. I know it's a difficult conversation,

25:47.586 --> 25:52.526
but again, the that is our

25:52.548 --> 25:56.462
primary service provide or service

25:56.596 --> 26:00.894
that we provide, where we get reimbursement from when

26:00.932 --> 26:05.026
looking at other large cities around the country, how are we as it

26:05.048 --> 26:07.918
relates to competitive salaries?

26:08.094 --> 26:11.346
Well, look, all I can base it on is what we provide,

26:11.448 --> 26:14.050
what we presented a year ago.

26:14.200 --> 26:18.294
And that was based on a total comp study for

26:18.332 --> 26:22.680
pay. And we were below the average, about 18%.

26:24.090 --> 26:28.246
The mayor and council approved us to increase the

26:28.268 --> 26:31.546
pay rate by 18% to try to help us get up to at

26:31.568 --> 26:34.620
least the median. But every year,

26:34.990 --> 26:39.302
the new contracts in other areas go up. There is incentives

26:39.366 --> 26:42.654
and pay increases that happen. And so we

26:42.692 --> 26:46.014
have to have a strategy to be

26:46.052 --> 26:49.386
competitive. Council member Amy

26:49.418 --> 26:53.390
Pitt. Thank you. And thank you, Chief, for the presentation.

26:54.210 --> 26:58.114
You talked about equipment purchased last year

26:58.152 --> 27:01.246
that we don't have to purchase this year, and that's why that line item

27:01.278 --> 27:04.606
went down. Can you talk a little bit about what's in the budget

27:04.638 --> 27:08.642
for just regular equipment, like normal wear and tear, aging equipment,

27:08.786 --> 27:12.278
also equipment that's stolen, like it was just stolen on engine

27:12.364 --> 27:15.320
four the other day, that kind of thing? Yes.

27:16.810 --> 27:20.506
I want to say it's unfortunate, but shrinkage is something that we experience as

27:20.528 --> 27:24.106
well here in the department several times.

27:24.288 --> 27:28.250
That was the most recent one. But we do experience

27:28.400 --> 27:32.074
theft oftentimes. A lot of times it's our employees

27:32.122 --> 27:35.886
who are the victims of that. At the fire stations, they have

27:35.988 --> 27:39.722
their vehicles broken into. We do have monies

27:39.786 --> 27:43.790
allocated council members for the MNO of our equipment.

27:44.710 --> 27:48.238
Every year we try to anticipate a certain number of replacement.

27:48.334 --> 27:52.354
We've taken a different approach in the last five years, starting from the big

27:52.392 --> 27:55.730
ticket items like our apparatus.

27:57.130 --> 28:00.678
We've gotten to the point where we are almost

28:00.764 --> 28:04.550
on schedule to replace every one of our apparatus every ten years.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.894
And so again, council and

28:07.932 --> 28:11.786
mayor, you all have made a significant investment in allowing us

28:11.808 --> 28:15.274
to get that plan implemented. But we've taken

28:15.312 --> 28:18.406
the same approach for everything in our inventory.

28:18.598 --> 28:22.154
Everything has a shelf life. Everything has a total life

28:22.192 --> 28:25.854
expectancy. It needs to be replaced. It's easier to replace and take

28:25.892 --> 28:29.326
small bites at the apple every year than to wait until we have

28:29.348 --> 28:32.618
to make wholesale replacements. It's very hard to budget

28:32.634 --> 28:36.178
that way. So to answer your question is yes, we do have

28:36.264 --> 28:39.886
a replacement plan for every one of our items

28:39.918 --> 28:43.314
that we have in our inventory. Great.

28:43.352 --> 28:46.514
Thank you. The Vehicle Lease program.

28:46.632 --> 28:50.406
I love this program. Are we planning on expanding that past the

28:50.428 --> 28:54.230
105 vehicles? Yes. The answer is yes.

28:54.380 --> 28:58.454
Our hope is that we're going to include all the arson vehicles and eventually

28:58.502 --> 29:02.218
all the light duty vehicles. We're also looking,

29:02.304 --> 29:06.730
and I'm working with staff to see if we can lease

29:07.790 --> 29:12.554
the heavy apparatus for those stations that are slowest

29:12.602 --> 29:15.854
in call volume. So the

29:15.892 --> 29:19.818
plan is to take those apparatus,

29:19.994 --> 29:23.454
take them off the board on the replacement plan, and put them into a lease

29:23.502 --> 29:28.014
program until we can make some significant improvements

29:28.062 --> 29:31.410
on the existing on the remaining ones, and then put them back

29:31.480 --> 29:34.580
into slowly fold them back into the replacement plan.

29:35.850 --> 29:39.526
One of the latest projections was

29:39.548 --> 29:43.062
that I can get ten vehicles for a million

29:43.116 --> 29:45.922
dollars a year on a lease, ten apparatus.

29:46.066 --> 29:49.442
And it would mean moving from CIP

29:49.586 --> 29:53.400
funding to operating funds. But I think that's a

29:54.010 --> 29:57.402
I mean, that's a proper use of government funds of city

29:57.456 --> 30:01.178
resources because it allows us to have one serviceable

30:01.274 --> 30:04.654
equipment and two at a lower cost per

30:04.692 --> 30:08.206
year. And so, yes, I'd like to

30:08.228 --> 30:11.600
expand it. The program that we have in place now,

30:11.970 --> 30:15.460
I think the proof of concept is that it works.

30:16.390 --> 30:20.514
As I mentioned, at worst, we break even. But we

30:20.552 --> 30:23.314
have brand new vehicles, one year old vehicles every year.

30:23.432 --> 30:27.978
And that not only increases our efficiencies, but it improves morale.

30:28.094 --> 30:31.074
We were running around with 1520 year old vehicles.

30:31.122 --> 30:34.002
A lot of them didn't even have the latest safety equipment.

30:34.146 --> 30:37.270
So this is a good program. I think

30:37.420 --> 30:40.790
it's good government. I think it's a responsible way of using city

30:40.860 --> 30:44.266
resources, and I'm hoping to expand this program. Great. Thank you,

30:44.288 --> 30:46.762
chief and vice chair. If you could put me back in the queue of another

30:46.816 --> 30:49.260
question. Thank you. Go ahead.

30:50.370 --> 30:53.742
My last question is, is there anything that we should

30:53.796 --> 30:57.326
be funding for insurance or accreditation reasons that

30:57.348 --> 30:59.950
we are not funding in this proposed budget?

31:02.370 --> 31:06.046
Okay, I'm not understanding your question. I know that there are

31:06.068 --> 31:09.378
certain things that we're supposed to like programs, numbers,

31:09.544 --> 31:12.354
that kind of thing that we're supposed to be doing every year. Is there something

31:12.392 --> 31:15.806
in the unmet needs that we should be doing? I mean, I know that everything

31:15.848 --> 31:19.586
is a need, but something that we could lose some kind of accreditation

31:19.698 --> 31:23.026
or insurance purposes that we should be funding that we're

31:23.058 --> 31:27.000
not? Well, look, we just got

31:27.690 --> 31:31.862
our ISO rating for the city of Houston and the Houston Fire Department.

31:32.006 --> 31:35.626
It came back as an ISO one, which is the highest level you

31:35.648 --> 31:39.494
can get. We just received our accreditation from the Commission on Fire Accreditation

31:39.542 --> 31:40.410
International.

31:44.290 --> 31:47.806
We've met the requirements for those. But we do have

31:47.828 --> 31:51.550
to be looking at the increase in call volume

31:51.890 --> 31:55.122
and what we're going to do about that. One of the things that we need

31:55.176 --> 31:58.866
is additional transport units. And I've mentioned this before, not only

31:58.888 --> 32:02.466
in this budget presentation, but in other committee presentations. We need

32:02.488 --> 32:06.630
more ambulances. Our response times for

32:06.700 --> 32:09.990
those call volume or those call types is going to increase.

32:11.370 --> 32:14.738
I don't know that we're at risk of losing any certification

32:14.834 --> 32:18.346
or accreditation for that. But we certainly at some

32:18.368 --> 32:22.106
point, if we don't make a strategic effort to

32:22.208 --> 32:25.706
address that, we won't be meeting the needs that the

32:25.728 --> 32:29.686
community is expecting. And so increasing ambulance

32:29.878 --> 32:33.006
capacity is one of the main things that we need to be

32:33.028 --> 32:36.158
looking at inspections is another one.

32:36.244 --> 32:37.870
We need more inspectors.

32:39.890 --> 32:43.158
Again, the biggest impact we're going to make is in the prevention

32:43.194 --> 32:46.770
side, not on the response side. So to do that, we need inspectors.

32:47.910 --> 32:51.250
We'll now move into the public comment period of the

32:51.400 --> 32:55.010
hearing. We have three virtual public speakers,

32:56.250 --> 33:00.486
and the first one is Saba Blanding. Please press

33:00.668 --> 33:04.230
star six to unmute. Saba Blanding.

33:15.150 --> 33:18.634
Okay, yeah, you think I have this down

33:18.672 --> 33:21.950
by now, but still a struggle.

33:24.210 --> 33:27.520
Chief, you really actually already answered my first question,

33:27.970 --> 33:31.150
but I'm going to ask it in case you wanted to expand.

33:31.730 --> 33:35.714
And that was what do you need in order to better provide preventative services?

33:35.832 --> 33:39.666
You mentioned increasing inspectors, and I was also curious in

33:39.688 --> 33:43.054
regards to that, if it's primarily an issue of staffing

33:43.102 --> 33:46.958
or training or both, and if there was any other needs you

33:46.984 --> 33:50.578
all had. And then along with that, I'm curious,

33:50.754 --> 33:54.486
what preventative measures do you think the city could take beyond what it

33:54.508 --> 33:58.266
currently exists to reduce the demand on your department on

33:58.288 --> 34:01.930
the response side? And I really appreciate you bringing up the importance of

34:02.000 --> 34:05.340
prevention. So that's my primary question. Thank you.

34:06.270 --> 34:09.580
Okay, so in regards to the inspectors question,

34:10.590 --> 34:14.046
it's both It's personnel and It's. Training in

34:14.068 --> 34:18.442
order to do fire inspections. The Texas Commission on Fire Protection requires

34:18.506 --> 34:22.062
a certification as a state inspector, and so that takes

34:22.116 --> 34:25.362
a little while to train

34:25.496 --> 34:27.970
people up, but first we need personnel.

34:29.190 --> 34:30.900
It's a combination of both.

34:32.390 --> 34:37.030
In regards to what would help in

34:37.180 --> 34:40.614
stemming the increased call volume. I think the

34:40.812 --> 34:45.526
more a concerted effort in

34:45.548 --> 34:48.940
a public safety message on the proper use of 911,

34:49.310 --> 34:53.878
we have a lot of calls that don't

34:54.054 --> 34:56.330
qualify as emergencies,

34:57.630 --> 35:00.782
but people still use the 911

35:00.836 --> 35:04.058
system for things that really could be handled

35:04.234 --> 35:08.286
in a different way. So I think we

35:08.308 --> 35:11.662
have some work to do in providing information,

35:11.796 --> 35:15.614
providing a

35:15.652 --> 35:19.294
better way of communicating how to properly

35:19.342 --> 35:23.780
use the 911 system because it's a busy system. As I mentioned, we run

35:24.230 --> 35:27.458
close to 350,000 calls for service every year,

35:27.624 --> 35:31.190
and that's just us. The 911 center receives

35:31.850 --> 35:35.030
a couple of million calls. I'm not exactly sure what the number

35:35.100 --> 35:38.502
is, but for both police and fire at the 911 center,

35:38.636 --> 35:42.586
and a

35:42.608 --> 35:46.374
certain percentage of those calls wouldn't really qualify

35:46.422 --> 35:50.640
as emergency, but we still have to respond to them, and so

35:52.050 --> 35:55.360
that would be one way to do that.

35:56.690 --> 36:00.270
Thank you. Our next virtual speaker is Mr. Jason Oliver.

36:05.270 --> 36:07.570
Please press star six to unmute.

36:09.510 --> 36:12.834
Hi, Chief. I wanted

36:12.872 --> 36:16.886
to follow up on something you mentioned about pay. You said that

36:17.068 --> 36:20.930
the 18% will bring. US up to the average

36:21.010 --> 36:23.480
from last year. Right.

36:24.730 --> 36:29.254
So any raises that departments or comparison

36:29.302 --> 36:33.194
departments have made last year or this year

36:33.312 --> 36:36.938
or next year. Right. When we get to the 18%,

36:37.024 --> 36:40.698
they'll be at 25 or 30%.

36:40.784 --> 36:44.178
Well, maybe not that far, but they'll be significantly beyond

36:44.294 --> 36:47.280
whatever we end up at. Is that correct?

36:48.210 --> 36:51.706
I do know, Mr. Oliver, that the city of Houston

36:51.818 --> 36:55.666
is commissioning a comp study for this year. It should be

36:55.688 --> 37:00.706
ready sometime this year, and we'll have a

37:00.728 --> 37:04.114
better target of where we stand in comparison to

37:04.152 --> 37:07.010
our counterparts in our industry.

37:10.010 --> 37:13.160
The 18% was much needed,

37:14.090 --> 37:17.606
and it's a huge step in the right direction. I will wait

37:17.628 --> 37:21.114
for the comp study to come up sometime this

37:21.152 --> 37:24.374
year, and then we will make the case for additional pay raises

37:24.422 --> 37:27.626
for our firefighters. But, look, it's retention and

37:27.648 --> 37:31.420
recruitment is a practical concern for me.

37:32.990 --> 37:36.906
We have to be competitive in our industry to maintain

37:36.938 --> 37:40.078
the talent that we have here on the department. It costs us a

37:40.084 --> 37:44.654
lot of money to train and recruit, and we want them to remain

37:44.702 --> 37:48.494
on this department. So one way to do that is to ensure

37:48.542 --> 37:53.058
that we're competitive in pay. And then one last

37:53.144 --> 37:57.526
question about I know the emergency center

37:57.628 --> 38:02.294
has come up kind of talking about how they're facing issues with

38:02.332 --> 38:05.570
pay, and the non emergency

38:05.650 --> 38:09.242
number response is a bit slow. Is that

38:09.296 --> 38:13.594
contributing to what you're seeing in terms of the

38:13.632 --> 38:17.014
kind of oversaturation of 911 and fire calls

38:17.062 --> 38:20.410
that you're responding to that aren't actual emergencies?

38:21.330 --> 38:24.862
Yes. So the 911 center employs civilian call

38:24.916 --> 38:28.878
takers. The initial call goes to that

38:29.044 --> 38:32.366
area. Those are civilians. And then, depending on the

38:32.388 --> 38:35.902
needs of the caller, whether it's fire medical,

38:35.966 --> 38:39.362
then it goes to the fire department. Any law enforcement need

38:39.416 --> 38:43.874
goes to the police department. From there, our dispatchers the

38:43.912 --> 38:47.954
second level once it gets past the call taker for the fire department

38:48.002 --> 38:51.266
are classified personnel, and we are fully

38:51.298 --> 38:55.494
staffed in that area.

38:55.692 --> 38:57.640
But again,

38:58.650 --> 39:01.834
it's more of a training, and we have to do a better

39:01.872 --> 39:05.578
job. We, the emergency services, need to do a better job of

39:05.664 --> 39:10.470
communicating and an educational approach

39:10.550 --> 39:14.014
for our community on the proper use of the 911

39:14.052 --> 39:17.614
system, what's an emergency, what would not be considered an emergency, and then provide

39:17.652 --> 39:21.806
them the resources on how else they can get their needs

39:21.908 --> 39:25.406
addressed without necessarily calling 911. So it's

39:25.438 --> 39:29.730
a more comprehensive approach to

39:29.880 --> 39:33.860
that question. Thank you.

39:34.890 --> 39:37.750
Our next virtual speaker is Mr. Doug Smith.

39:41.050 --> 39:42.920
Can you hear me? Yes.

39:44.330 --> 39:48.454
Great. You just said you

39:48.492 --> 39:51.850
received the top ratings from the two rating agencies, and I've heard in the past

39:51.920 --> 39:55.846
that the fire department is understaffed

39:55.878 --> 39:58.950
and you could use a lot more people. And I'm wondering

39:59.030 --> 40:03.194
if there's a concern that you could possibly lose those ratings

40:03.322 --> 40:06.990
if you don't get the people you need. That's one question.

40:07.060 --> 40:10.334
The second question on page

40:10.452 --> 40:13.630
three, four of your report. It's the statistics,

40:13.710 --> 40:18.050
performance measures. You don't have any response times

40:18.200 --> 40:21.474
for first unit call response times for

40:21.592 --> 40:25.414
either EMS or fire, and I'm wondering why that

40:25.452 --> 40:29.522
is. And also on that page, you talk about EMS

40:29.586 --> 40:32.786
incidents and responses and fire incidents

40:32.818 --> 40:36.390
and responses, and the responses are a lot higher

40:36.460 --> 40:41.286
than the incidents, and I'm curious what the differentiation

40:41.318 --> 40:42.700
is between those two.

40:44.590 --> 40:48.540
Okay, Mr. Smith, you're going to have to repeat the second part of

40:49.070 --> 40:52.590
your question, the first one in regards to staffing,

40:53.970 --> 40:57.066
look, I've made several presentations to the Public Safety

40:57.098 --> 41:01.322
Committee. I made the same presentation

41:01.466 --> 41:05.018
last year regarding when we presented

41:05.034 --> 41:08.642
our budget regarding staffing in 2019 and 2020,

41:08.776 --> 41:13.310
we missed our recruitment target by about 280 firefighters.

41:13.390 --> 41:17.574
That was as a result of Proposition B passing and us

41:17.612 --> 41:20.840
having to cancel four academy classes at that point.

41:21.770 --> 41:24.934
That caused us to miss the

41:24.972 --> 41:28.666
recruitment by 280 firefighters that year. By the

41:28.688 --> 41:31.260
time we started recruitment again,

41:32.190 --> 41:35.482
it was 18 months without hiring a single

41:35.536 --> 41:38.458
firefighter. And in that time,

41:38.624 --> 41:42.074
attrition continued. The normal and annual attrition

41:42.122 --> 41:46.186
continued to happen in 2020, we had higher than normal attrition.

41:46.378 --> 41:48.960
So that exacerbated the issue.

41:49.650 --> 41:53.294
Since that time, we've been approved 280

41:53.342 --> 41:57.060
firefighters per year to be hired. This year,

41:57.430 --> 42:00.686
the mayor approved the fifth class, which puts

42:00.718 --> 42:04.654
us at 350 firefighters that we're going to be hiring

42:04.782 --> 42:08.550
this fiscal year. That is, in attempts to

42:08.620 --> 42:12.882
make up for what we lost in 2019 and 2020. Our normal

42:12.946 --> 42:15.320
annual attrition is about 170.

42:15.930 --> 42:19.750
That's retirements, that's resignations. That's everything else

42:19.820 --> 42:23.718
about 170. We're having to hire 100 above

42:23.734 --> 42:26.906
and beyond the normal attrition to try to make up for what we

42:26.928 --> 42:29.500
lost again in 2019 and 2020.

42:30.110 --> 42:33.794
But my most precious resource

42:33.862 --> 42:37.038
is the first year firefighter, because it takes about a year to

42:37.044 --> 42:40.366
get them recruited, to get them trained and get them out into the

42:40.388 --> 42:44.046
stations. So it's a long process, and that's why

42:44.068 --> 42:47.266
it's taken us so long. It's going to take us several fiscal years to make

42:47.288 --> 42:51.106
up what we lost back then. It is

42:51.128 --> 42:54.740
a concern for us. We are making up

42:55.130 --> 42:58.434
that shortage by increasing

42:58.482 --> 43:01.830
our overtime budget numbers in order to

43:01.980 --> 43:05.446
bring in personnel to make up for those

43:05.468 --> 43:09.126
shortages. But the goal is, the strategic goal is to get back

43:09.148 --> 43:12.986
up to full staffing, because at that point, it would allow me to

43:13.008 --> 43:16.410
make the additional ask for more ambulances and more

43:16.480 --> 43:20.330
inspectors and more capacity to be able to service the increased demand.

43:21.150 --> 43:24.474
If you can repeat your have the rating

43:24.522 --> 43:28.014
agencies indicated any concern about the fact that you

43:28.052 --> 43:32.160
are dough as you just described? Doug, is this your second question?

43:34.770 --> 43:38.450
Well, it's related to the question you just answered,

43:39.270 --> 43:43.620
but the second question relates to page

43:44.070 --> 43:47.570
item three four, where you have your performance

43:47.730 --> 43:52.118
measures and you don't have any targets for

43:52.284 --> 43:55.958
first call response for either fire or EMS in 2023.

43:55.964 --> 43:58.780
And then on that same page,

43:59.630 --> 44:03.610
you talk about EMS incidents and responses and

44:03.760 --> 44:07.306
fire incidents and responses, and responses are

44:07.408 --> 44:11.306
a lot higher than the incidents. And I'm just wondering what's

44:11.338 --> 44:14.686
the difference between those two. So the reason for

44:14.708 --> 44:18.474
that, Doug, is we're switching to accreditation measures.

44:18.522 --> 44:21.230
In the past, we were reporting averages.

44:21.810 --> 44:25.246
The average means that half the time you're better, but half the time you're

44:25.278 --> 44:29.282
worse. The accreditation measure now is based

44:29.336 --> 44:32.398
on percentiles. The 90th percentile is what they're

44:32.414 --> 44:36.642
measuring. That gives a better picture

44:36.706 --> 44:40.246
of your capacity and the type

44:40.268 --> 44:43.400
of service you're delivering. That's the reason for that change.

44:43.930 --> 44:47.000
We're also looking at outcome based

44:47.470 --> 44:51.974
responses instead of just simply showing

44:52.022 --> 44:55.434
up in a certain amount

44:55.472 --> 44:58.986
of time and stopping the clock. Again, that's the

44:59.008 --> 45:03.166
reason right now that you're seeing a lot of first

45:03.348 --> 45:06.442
response units, ladder trucks, fire trucks,

45:06.506 --> 45:09.550
when you actually need a medical and EMS transport unit.

45:10.690 --> 45:14.390
We haven't been tracking that appropriately. We're stopping

45:14.410 --> 45:18.210
the clock based on response times without really looking at the outcome.

45:18.710 --> 45:22.542
That is going to provide me the analysis and the tools

45:22.686 --> 45:26.178
to make the case for those additional units that

45:26.344 --> 45:29.586
we desperately need. I know we need more ambulances.

45:29.698 --> 45:33.222
That's the reason that we're sending the first available unit. A lot of times

45:33.356 --> 45:36.706
they show up just to stop the clock and then they're

45:36.738 --> 45:40.330
waiting for that ambulance and transport unit to arrive minutes

45:40.400 --> 45:43.914
later. The answer to that is not

45:44.112 --> 45:47.574
adding more fire trucks. It's adding more ambulance capacity,

45:47.622 --> 45:51.454
which will help the system. It'll improve the response times for

45:51.492 --> 45:55.422
transport and it really will improve the working

45:55.476 --> 45:59.614
environment. Thank you, Chief. And what

45:59.652 --> 46:03.200
about the incidents and response difference between those two?

46:04.050 --> 46:05.440
What are you looking at?

46:17.040 --> 46:19.868
Doug? I'm going to have to get back to you on that. I don't want

46:19.874 --> 46:23.820
to give you an answer off the fly. I got to see exactly what you

46:23.890 --> 46:27.712
are asking about. And Mrs. Smith, if you want to submit any

46:27.766 --> 46:31.196
additional questions to District E at Houst Gov,

46:31.228 --> 46:33.520
we'll get back to you shortly.

46:34.580 --> 46:37.792
I know and I appreciate it. Thank you all. Thank you.

46:37.846 --> 46:41.220
Thank you. We will now move into the in person

46:41.290 --> 46:44.708
public comment period. Public speakers, please make your way to

46:44.714 --> 46:47.876
the podium after your name is called. We have one in

46:47.898 --> 46:51.784
person speaker. Mr. Butler, please come

46:51.822 --> 46:52.410
forward.

46:55.340 --> 46:58.872
Ms. McHenry, if you could please step back

46:58.926 --> 47:02.510
and he will be able to use your microphone and then you can come back.

47:05.440 --> 47:06.510
Thank you.

47:13.520 --> 47:17.004
Good morning. Good morning. You have two minutes for questions.

47:17.122 --> 47:20.368
Thank you. How are you? How are you, chief? Good to see you.

47:20.374 --> 47:23.516
Mr. Brother, good to see you as well. My name is Broderick Butler and I'm

47:23.548 --> 47:27.036
a resident of Cynic Wood neighborhood in northeast Houston,

47:27.068 --> 47:30.132
which is District B. I'd like to thank the Chief for his

47:30.186 --> 47:33.476
leadership. I have a few questions for him, but first a

47:33.498 --> 47:37.376
statement. I want him to thank Al Bennett,

47:37.488 --> 47:41.396
who has made sure that my community has gotten carbon monoxide detectors

47:41.428 --> 47:44.724
and smoke detectors and continues to do so recently.

47:44.852 --> 47:48.196
So my three questions are this. In a previous budget

47:48.228 --> 47:51.924
cycle chief, you mentioned to this committee that you had a significant

47:51.972 --> 47:55.756
number of engines in your fleet that were in disrepair. You were

47:55.778 --> 47:58.920
waiting on new engines, and you were also seeking

47:59.000 --> 48:03.032
to technology, but you're also waiting to seek

48:03.176 --> 48:06.704
more training for your firefighters. You've addressed these points in

48:06.742 --> 48:09.920
some of the questions that were posed to you today. But again,

48:10.070 --> 48:14.064
the theme is, can you reiterate has

48:14.102 --> 48:17.828
any of these issues been addressed at this point? That's the first question.

48:17.994 --> 48:22.032
The second question is, given that you have five incoming classes

48:22.096 --> 48:25.844
queued up, that's great news, but are you currently having

48:25.882 --> 48:29.456
trouble recruiting applicants within the Houston city limits?

48:29.568 --> 48:33.144
If so, what have you done to combat that? And the thought is

48:33.182 --> 48:36.840
about increasing diversity, as one of the council members mentioned.

48:36.910 --> 48:40.532
And so these themes are sort of repetitive themes,

48:40.596 --> 48:44.540
but my last question actually deals with my specific community as

48:44.610 --> 48:48.444
sort of the other ones overlay, and that is we're going

48:48.482 --> 48:52.376
in hurricane season and how many firehouses in Northeast?

48:52.408 --> 48:56.096
Houston, which is sort of north of

48:56.198 --> 49:00.512
610, east of 59. Specifically the seven 70

49:00.566 --> 49:04.320
116 zip code have

49:04.390 --> 49:07.920
water evacuation and water rescue equipment.

49:08.080 --> 49:11.408
And from what I know, the Tidwell

49:11.504 --> 49:14.964
firehouse has one boat. But my question going

49:15.002 --> 49:18.644
forward is, is there a possibility or

49:18.682 --> 49:22.644
opportunity to increase the number of boats or water rescue

49:22.772 --> 49:26.570
equipment and apparatuses that are in my section of the city?

49:27.900 --> 49:31.256
Mr. Weller, thank you, first of all, for your question and for being here in

49:31.278 --> 49:34.584
person. I know that's important.

49:34.702 --> 49:38.504
All this is important to you. So I wrote down your questions.

49:38.622 --> 49:43.272
I will thank albennett is one of our better

49:43.326 --> 49:46.944
employees, and he's very responsive and he's very committed to what he's doing.

49:46.982 --> 49:50.290
So I'll certainly relay your thanks to him

49:50.740 --> 49:53.936
in regards to the engines and disrepair. Five years

49:53.958 --> 49:57.348
ago, five and a half years ago when

49:57.434 --> 50:00.880
I came here, we had an issue with an aging

50:00.960 --> 50:04.256
fleet. There was no question about that. We had engines

50:04.448 --> 50:07.780
that were essentially catching fire on scene.

50:08.440 --> 50:12.848
That was as a result of the

50:12.874 --> 50:16.264
way they were purchasing these units. They're very expensive. A fire

50:16.302 --> 50:19.380
truck cost us about $600,000 per unit.

50:19.460 --> 50:22.616
A ladder truck is over a million dollars. It's very expensive.

50:22.808 --> 50:26.636
They made a large purchase. They had made a large purchase about

50:26.738 --> 50:31.916
15 years before that, and they

50:31.938 --> 50:35.336
didn't have a comprehensive replacement plan, which meant

50:35.368 --> 50:38.468
that you buy a large purchase of fleet vehicles

50:38.504 --> 50:41.744
at one point, and they're great when they're new, but then they all start

50:41.782 --> 50:44.770
aging at the same time and falling apart at the same time.

50:45.380 --> 50:49.140
I'm happy to report that thanks to the mayor and council and their support,

50:49.290 --> 50:53.120
we've replaced over 50% of the entire fleet

50:53.200 --> 50:56.676
in these last five years. We have

50:56.778 --> 51:00.728
a small percentage that now is outside the

51:00.814 --> 51:04.036
ten year expected lifecycle of these heavy

51:04.068 --> 51:07.896
apparatus. We have begun to focus not

51:07.918 --> 51:11.768
only on the heavy apparatus and ambulances, but we

51:11.774 --> 51:15.708
were also focusing on the light duty vehicles, as we mentioned through some other

51:15.794 --> 51:19.164
creative programs, the lease of these vehicles and

51:19.202 --> 51:22.600
outright purchase of these. So we're making a wholesale

51:22.760 --> 51:26.108
replacement of all apparatus. They're all emergency response

51:26.124 --> 51:29.776
apparatus in my estimation. But in regards to

51:29.798 --> 51:33.740
the engines and the ladder trucks, we have made significant

51:33.820 --> 51:37.404
improvements in the state of this fleet. In addition

51:37.452 --> 51:41.316
to that, the ambulance replacements, we've replaced almost 50% of

51:41.338 --> 51:44.596
those ambulances as well. We are

51:44.618 --> 51:49.056
no longer doing the refurbishing and putting them back into

51:49.178 --> 51:53.240
the system. We're buying turnkey ambulances,

51:53.900 --> 51:57.368
which with all the new safety features that

51:57.454 --> 52:00.808
come with the new apparatus. So that's a better

52:00.974 --> 52:05.384
and safer unit for our firefighters. So in

52:05.422 --> 52:08.924
regards to that, yes, we are well over 50% of

52:09.042 --> 52:12.140
replacement of our entire fleet in terms of technology.

52:12.290 --> 52:15.452
We have made significant investments in that too. We've replaced all our

52:15.506 --> 52:18.476
MDTs and the majority of our apparatus.

52:18.588 --> 52:22.684
We've also switched over our records management system for our inspectors.

52:22.812 --> 52:25.936
Now we're in the in four program. In the past, they were doing

52:25.958 --> 52:29.284
their inspections and documenting on paper.

52:29.482 --> 52:32.640
That's very antiquated, very inefficient. We've made significant

52:32.720 --> 52:36.576
improvements in technology in that respect. Every one of our apparatus,

52:36.608 --> 52:39.604
our heavy apparatus, has a thermal imaging camera. Now,

52:39.802 --> 52:43.572
in the past, that was not the case. So we've provided

52:43.636 --> 52:47.336
that in terms of technology. And so I can point to

52:47.358 --> 52:51.210
a variety of areas where we've made improvements in technology training.

52:51.920 --> 52:55.656
Again, sometimes we can't

52:55.688 --> 52:59.244
get the contributions from the general fund

52:59.362 --> 53:02.556
because of different priorities, but we haven't stopped there.

53:02.738 --> 53:06.352
We've looked for nontraditional funding sources to provide for

53:06.406 --> 53:10.828
training and equipment and health and safety aspects for our firefighters.

53:11.004 --> 53:15.072
In the last five and a half years, we've drawn down almost $11 million

53:15.206 --> 53:19.124
of grant funds that are dedicated for either training or

53:19.162 --> 53:22.896
equipment or improvements for health and safety of our firefighters. So we're

53:22.928 --> 53:26.420
making progress in that. In regards to applicants,

53:28.280 --> 53:32.024
especially for applicants from within the city limits, I completely agree

53:32.062 --> 53:35.032
with you. Matter of fact,

53:35.166 --> 53:39.608
in this last month, I've met with the

53:39.694 --> 53:42.936
superintendent for HISD, the vice superintendent

53:42.968 --> 53:46.396
for HISD, and we're looking at a program to be able

53:46.418 --> 53:49.870
to recruit individuals right out of high school.

53:50.640 --> 53:54.092
The requirement for 24 credit hours of

53:54.146 --> 53:57.436
college hasn't changed. But what

53:57.458 --> 54:00.336
we do know is that there are a lot of students, and according to their

54:00.358 --> 54:03.824
numbers, there are about 6000 students every year that graduate with

54:03.942 --> 54:07.460
an equivalent of 24 credit hours that

54:07.530 --> 54:10.964
come from AP classes or come from

54:11.082 --> 54:14.144
other early college courses

54:14.272 --> 54:17.696
that right now we hadn't been capturing. My goal

54:17.728 --> 54:22.356
is to be able to go directly into these communities that are underrepresented

54:22.468 --> 54:26.472
in our department and recruit directly from high school

54:26.526 --> 54:30.132
onto this organization. When they graduate,

54:30.196 --> 54:33.436
they have choices. Some of them go to college, some of

54:33.438 --> 54:37.224
them go to the military, some go to work. I want to be another choice

54:37.352 --> 54:41.004
for those where we can provide a career for these

54:41.042 --> 54:44.460
individuals and they have the opportunity to serve in their communities.

54:45.040 --> 54:48.224
So we are looking at that, and I agree with you. Our department should be

54:48.262 --> 54:51.264
representative of the communities that we serve. That has

54:51.302 --> 54:55.580
been a focus of mine. If you see our demographics,

54:55.740 --> 54:59.780
we've made huge improvements in recruitment of more minorities

55:00.440 --> 55:04.550
into the fire department. And there

55:04.920 --> 55:08.436
we did some things. We made some changes that just increased the number of

55:08.458 --> 55:11.280
qualified applicants. The standards haven't changed.

55:11.360 --> 55:15.124
Okay. But if we can have a bigger pool of applicants,

55:15.172 --> 55:18.744
then we can be more selective as far as who can come in. We're not

55:18.782 --> 55:22.812
having any trouble filling the classes that we have for

55:22.866 --> 55:26.284
the academy. We have had some challenges, especially during

55:26.322 --> 55:30.808
the Pandemic, where we had to do remote learning in classes via virtually,

55:30.984 --> 55:34.304
because getting a certification for an EMT is

55:34.342 --> 55:37.970
not the virtual approach is not conducive to that.

55:38.420 --> 55:41.856
The curriculum is very challenging. They need

55:42.038 --> 55:45.376
the in class tuition, so our

55:45.398 --> 55:48.636
attrition rate there has been higher than normal. We're hoping

55:48.668 --> 55:53.184
that has changed. Council has approved us getting additional resources

55:53.312 --> 55:57.524
and buildings at the train academy to be able to provide that training.

55:57.722 --> 56:01.556
So we're hoping that that changes for the better in

56:01.578 --> 56:04.936
regard to hurricane season and the assets. When I got here in

56:04.958 --> 56:08.516
2017, we had Harvey. We didn't have any high water vehicles.

56:08.548 --> 56:11.560
Matter of fact, we had one, and that was from District A,

56:11.630 --> 56:14.860
and we got that vehicle the day that Harvey made

56:14.930 --> 56:18.332
landfall. Since then, we've made

56:18.386 --> 56:21.852
tremendous progress. Now we have 15 high water

56:21.906 --> 56:24.190
vehicles that are spread out throughout the city.

56:25.460 --> 56:28.956
We've replaced our boats. Those are all serviceable.

56:29.068 --> 56:32.704
We have an 80 member water strike team that is now trained and

56:32.742 --> 56:36.304
equipped and ready to deploy and augment for

56:36.342 --> 56:38.900
these resources for these incidents.

56:39.400 --> 56:43.504
And we've also made partnerships.

56:43.632 --> 56:46.836
We've used our network with other departments to be

56:46.858 --> 56:50.296
able to meet the training requirements and to

56:50.318 --> 56:53.156
be able to scale up if required.

56:53.348 --> 56:57.112
One example is we've partnered with Public

56:57.166 --> 57:00.376
Works. Do you know how many people fit in the

57:00.398 --> 57:03.630
back of a dump truck? 38. Yes, I do.

57:05.040 --> 57:08.476
Yes, sir. And the reason we know that is because we've used those in the

57:08.498 --> 57:12.252
past, but now we've incorporated them into the Cat

57:12.306 --> 57:16.064
system. So if we expect a

57:16.182 --> 57:19.292
hurricane or some inclement weather, we will deploy

57:19.436 --> 57:23.692
resources from Public Works in other areas into our fire stations,

57:23.756 --> 57:27.460
and they'll have a firefighter assigned to them to be able to

57:27.610 --> 57:31.316
manage and be an additional asset in addition to

57:31.498 --> 57:35.348
what we have. So we have made tremendous strides in

57:35.354 --> 57:38.470
that respect as well. In these short five years.

57:39.260 --> 57:42.728
The resources are spread out throughout the city.

57:42.894 --> 57:48.200
Okay. And that is a tactical decision,

57:49.100 --> 57:51.416
but they're deployable anywhere in the city.

57:51.518 --> 57:53.630
Okay. Shift. Absolutely.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.390
One is that we can't put all the resources in one area because

57:59.760 --> 58:03.580
there may not be enough room. But we do know, and based on

58:03.730 --> 58:07.184
what we anticipate, as far as if there's a certain area that we're more

58:07.222 --> 58:11.056
concerned about, then we will shift resources and pre deploy them to

58:11.158 --> 58:14.624
a little bit closer. But those resources are city

58:14.662 --> 58:18.156
of Houston resources, the fire department's resources. It doesn't mean that they belong

58:18.188 --> 58:21.456
to a certain district. We keep them in certain areas,

58:21.488 --> 58:24.996
but we can deploy them and shift as needed. So my

58:25.018 --> 58:28.564
only concern at this point is hopefully the council sees the

58:28.602 --> 58:32.344
benefit of scaling you up compared to the county scaling up

58:32.382 --> 58:36.036
the sheriff's department so that you can actually stand in the breach

58:36.148 --> 58:39.592
if and when and really not if, when the next

58:39.646 --> 58:43.832
natural disaster hits our city that has to deal with water rescue.

58:43.896 --> 58:47.150
Right. Well, look, again,

58:47.680 --> 58:50.940
we welcome those additional resources,

58:51.760 --> 58:55.520
but we are certainly also reaching out to other

58:55.670 --> 58:59.228
response agencies to have a unified

58:59.324 --> 59:02.928
front and in response to our community's needs.

59:03.094 --> 59:06.948
We work very well with the Houston Police Department. We work very well with

59:07.034 --> 59:10.212
the Harris County Sheriff's Department. We work very well with Public

59:10.266 --> 59:12.820
Works and all other city departments.

59:13.560 --> 59:18.080
We have a good network of personnel

59:18.240 --> 59:20.790
that train together.

59:21.320 --> 59:25.016
We're familiar with each other's capabilities and the resources that we can come

59:25.038 --> 59:28.376
to bring to bear in case we need it, because I think

59:28.398 --> 59:31.896
that's a more efficient way of meeting the expected

59:31.928 --> 59:34.830
risk of this community strategic partnership. Absolutely.

59:35.360 --> 59:39.164
And the key is to have those partnerships in place before the

59:39.202 --> 59:41.630
disaster happens. Thank you very much.

59:43.200 --> 59:46.776
If we have any additional questions, you can always share those at District

59:46.808 --> 59:50.076
E, at Houst, gov. Ms.

59:50.108 --> 59:54.352
McHenry, did you have anything additional that you would like to speak on

59:54.486 --> 59:57.888
that we have not covered? Okay. Well, chief, I want to

59:57.894 --> 1:00:01.376
thank you and your entire department for the tremendous presentation and the tremendous

1:00:01.408 --> 1:00:05.136
job you all do on a daily basis to keep Houstonian safe.

1:00:05.248 --> 1:00:09.076
As a council, we are very much appreciative of

1:00:09.098 --> 1:00:12.056
all that you do and all of the contributions that you make. So to you

1:00:12.078 --> 1:00:15.576
and your entire team, thank you very much. Thank you.

1:00:15.598 --> 1:00:18.904
Council Member there are no additional in person speakers before

1:00:18.942 --> 1:00:22.584
we adjourn. Please note, budget workshops will continue next

1:00:22.622 --> 1:00:26.084
week, starting Monday, May 16 through Thursday,

1:00:26.212 --> 1:00:30.344
May 19. Reminder to council members to be checking SharePoint for

1:00:30.382 --> 1:00:34.256
uploaded presentations as well as responses for any questions and

1:00:34.278 --> 1:00:37.904
submitted. Thank you again to everyone for being here, and this

1:00:37.942 --> 1:00:39.440
meeting is adjourned.
