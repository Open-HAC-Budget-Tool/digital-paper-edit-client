WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:04.074
Abby came and shaking her head no, but I love droughts. Difference of opinion.

00:04.122 --> 00:08.510
Thank you. We will now transition from parks and recreation to

00:08.660 --> 00:12.640
Houston Police department. At this time, I would welcome

00:14.130 --> 00:17.674
Chief Fender and Miss Rhonda. Smith, the CFO

00:17.722 --> 00:21.306
of Houston Police Department, along with Chief

00:21.338 --> 00:25.426
Satterwhite. Chief Slinkert. And I thought I saw Chief

00:25.458 --> 00:28.680
Jones as well. So good to see everybody.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.096
And of course, Ms. Rhonda Smith, the CFO. Chief,

00:37.128 --> 00:41.020
I saw you in DC. You look good. How was that plane trip?

00:43.360 --> 00:46.030
Oh, you're a smart man. Yeah.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.630
Good to see you.

01:17.080 --> 01:21.056
I just want to thank each and every council

01:21.088 --> 01:24.640
member for such support. It means a lot

01:24.730 --> 01:27.892
having the opportunity to talk to chiefs all around the nation

01:28.036 --> 01:32.024
and to have the support from the Horseshoe. It means a lot,

01:32.062 --> 01:33.770
but we'll jump right into it.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.364
Chief Troy Finner. And on behalf of the Houston Police Department,

01:40.412 --> 01:43.516
I appreciate the opportunity to submit the HPD's

01:43.548 --> 01:47.728
proposed budget budget for FY 2023.

01:47.894 --> 01:51.808
Let me first say how proud I am to be the police

01:51.824 --> 01:54.260
chief in this great city with this great department.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.620
The benefit of the burian audience.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.500
HPD is the largest agency in the state of Texas,

02:01.680 --> 02:05.640
fourth largest in the nation. We have over

02:05.790 --> 02:09.464
I'm sorry, the fifth largest in the nation. We have over 6100,

02:09.662 --> 02:13.480
both classified and civilian employees.

02:14.220 --> 02:18.376
Before moving forward, I'd like to acknowledge the men and women of the Houston Police

02:18.408 --> 02:21.976
Department, but especially the executive staff and the budget

02:22.008 --> 02:25.576
and finance staff who has worked so diligently to prepare

02:25.608 --> 02:29.856
this presentation. This year began and

02:29.878 --> 02:33.776
has been very challenging for us, as around the

02:33.798 --> 02:38.112
nation, we lost some of our own family members. But in

02:38.166 --> 02:42.276
Houston and Harris County, there was a total of six.

02:42.458 --> 02:45.760
Now, last week, seven line of duty deaths.

02:45.920 --> 02:51.840
We also faced the challenge of increasing

02:51.920 --> 02:55.110
crime. At the beginning of the year, especially,

02:56.120 --> 02:59.770
my top priority is to address those.

03:00.380 --> 03:04.116
The trends of increasing crime was to reduce

03:04.148 --> 03:06.830
the violent crime, enhance technology,

03:07.200 --> 03:09.420
and also improve the staffing.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.516
Just want to say the One

03:13.538 --> 03:17.276
Safe Houston initiative has been successful. We've been doing an

03:17.298 --> 03:20.576
excellent job looking at the numbers. Every week

03:20.678 --> 03:24.060
those numbers have been going down, and we've seen a reduction

03:24.220 --> 03:27.392
in violent crime on a weekly basis. So, again,

03:27.446 --> 03:31.424
I want to thank the mayor, I want to thank City Council for

03:31.462 --> 03:35.284
the additional opera rescue funding and

03:35.322 --> 03:38.576
fighting crime and reducing some of that crime

03:38.688 --> 03:42.296
and improving the quality of life. I want to hit on

03:42.478 --> 03:45.690
one stat before we move forward.

03:47.740 --> 03:51.332
In January, as compared to the previous

03:51.396 --> 03:54.990
year, our homicide numbers were over 70%.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.684
Today it's 7%. And that is

03:58.722 --> 04:02.728
a direct result of good policing,

04:02.904 --> 04:06.092
but also everybody working together,

04:06.146 --> 04:09.730
our citizens and the criminal justice system coming together.

04:11.300 --> 04:16.320
Technology. We have secured the following major technology milestones.

04:16.660 --> 04:20.036
Body warrant camera upgrades will allow us

04:20.058 --> 04:22.772
to purchase the next well, 300 I'm sorry,

04:22.826 --> 04:26.740
3500 next generation body worn cameras.

04:28.040 --> 04:32.140
The HPD data center locate relocation.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.808
We completely moved the HPD primary data center

04:36.894 --> 04:40.410
to a shared space within the city data center.

04:41.020 --> 04:45.000
We've moved over 300 servers.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.136
We've implemented Shot spotters not only in the Southeast,

04:50.168 --> 04:52.350
but also in the North Division. Now,

04:56.660 --> 05:00.540
I'm sorry, our RMS system, we're in a quiet period,

05:00.700 --> 05:04.480
but we have an RFP out.

05:04.630 --> 05:08.684
That's all I'm going to say about that. But it will assist

05:08.732 --> 05:11.060
us in our fight of violent crime.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.848
We want to make our real time crime center a true strategic

05:16.944 --> 05:21.184
decision support system. The expansion

05:21.232 --> 05:24.584
of automated license plate readers in

05:24.622 --> 05:27.992
high crime areas and also cameras. So we're looking,

05:28.046 --> 05:31.924
and I want to thank certain council members for funding

05:31.972 --> 05:35.676
that. It's something that we want to

05:35.858 --> 05:40.364
move around the city, but it's not just the responsibility of

05:40.562 --> 05:44.190
the city and taxpayers. We want to get everybody on board on that.

05:47.120 --> 05:50.816
We also, in terms of staffing, we have to

05:50.838 --> 05:54.252
continue to fund the five academy classes

05:54.316 --> 05:55.170
each year.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.324
Also want to thank council for

06:02.362 --> 06:05.540
working on city audience, for the Cadillac converter audience,

06:05.880 --> 06:10.404
the noise audits audits. And also the

06:10.442 --> 06:14.388
exterior security video camera audit audits.

06:14.564 --> 06:18.280
And also the county for passing the

06:18.350 --> 06:22.040
10% bond for defendants charged with violent crime.

06:27.340 --> 06:31.064
The presentation will begin with an overview of organizational

06:31.112 --> 06:34.508
structure. For the sake of time, I will move through these slides quickly

06:34.674 --> 06:38.540
and answer any questions at the end. Next slide.

06:40.740 --> 06:44.560
This slide shows a current organization structure.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.000
Next slide.

06:50.020 --> 06:53.476
This slide is basically the addition of the

06:53.498 --> 06:57.408
executive assistant Chief I'm sorry, the Executive chief, chief Slinker,

06:57.504 --> 07:01.140
which we added that new position at the beginning of my administration.

07:03.420 --> 07:07.416
Next slide. This is

07:07.438 --> 07:10.520
the office of the police, of the Chief of Police.

07:11.020 --> 07:14.920
Everything that's up under my command. Next slide.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.700
This slide, it looks at investigations and special operations.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.420
It's under Chief Jones.

07:26.630 --> 07:30.770
And the next slide is patrol operations on the chief satellite.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.230
Next slide, please. This is a special fund.

07:40.020 --> 07:44.060
In addition to our general funds, our organization includes

07:44.140 --> 07:48.660
operations and special funds. These are funds that are restricted.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.608
The money is restricted for restricted use. I meant to say Ms.

07:52.624 --> 07:56.260
Smith will go into further detail here just shortly.

07:57.420 --> 08:00.696
Next slide. Want to look at the

08:00.718 --> 08:04.552
breakdown of gender of our agency. The significant thing about

08:04.606 --> 08:08.596
this slide is for cities of over 1 million

08:08.718 --> 08:11.740
in population I'm sorry,

08:11.810 --> 08:14.430
we move it. One more slide. One more.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.990
Thank you.

08:19.940 --> 08:22.720
For cities over 1 million in population.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.064
And the police departments have 17% female.

08:28.192 --> 08:31.776
HPD is also at 17%. For the civilian,

08:31.808 --> 08:34.500
that's for classified. For the civilians,

08:36.140 --> 08:39.736
we're at 68% as compared to the national average of

08:39.758 --> 08:41.050
66%.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.756
HPD is one of the most diverse law enforcement agencies

08:46.788 --> 08:50.330
in the nation. We're a majority I'm sorry. Next slide. Go to it.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.476
HPD is one of the most diverse agencies in

08:56.498 --> 09:00.052
the nation. We are a majority minority police department

09:00.216 --> 09:04.076
with 78.9% of the civilians

09:04.108 --> 09:08.060
are minority, 60.9% of classified.

09:08.220 --> 09:11.696
A closer breakdown of it looking at the classified side,

09:11.798 --> 09:14.288
39% Caucasian,

09:14.464 --> 09:17.460
31% Hispanic or Latino,

09:18.040 --> 09:22.484
21% African American and

09:22.602 --> 09:26.516
8% Asian. For the civilian workforce,

09:26.628 --> 09:29.530
we have 45% African American,

09:30.060 --> 09:33.716
21% White, 25% Latino

09:33.748 --> 09:36.280
Hispanic and then 8% Asian.

09:38.400 --> 09:42.044
The department programming. I always like to state our

09:42.082 --> 09:45.630
mission statement. Mission statement is to hang the quality of life

09:46.240 --> 09:49.870
in the city of Houston by working

09:50.580 --> 09:53.856
cooperatively with the public within the framework work of

09:53.878 --> 09:58.160
the US constitution to enforce laws, preserve the peace,

09:58.900 --> 10:01.680
reduce fear, and provide a safe environment.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.500
Next slide.

10:06.680 --> 10:10.336
Reducing violent crime is one of the mayor's

10:10.448 --> 10:14.384
highest priorities, and we have made great strides in accomplishing

10:14.512 --> 10:18.280
the goal. Despite financial challenges and staffing,

10:18.940 --> 10:23.204
some of the core duties prevent

10:23.252 --> 10:27.120
crime, respond to calls for service, conduct investigations,

10:27.300 --> 10:30.380
arrest individuals suspected of committing crimes,

10:30.720 --> 10:34.700
coordinate with Homeland Security activities, protect lives and property

10:34.770 --> 10:38.232
during mass gathering and special events, and also enforcing

10:38.296 --> 10:41.520
traffic. Next slide.

10:43.540 --> 10:47.680
Department program continues statutory requirements of

10:47.830 --> 10:51.084
delivery of services. The Texas Code of Criminal

10:51.132 --> 10:54.548
Procedure and the city ordinance. Chapter 34, article two,

10:54.634 --> 10:57.860
defines the duties of the Houston Police Department.

10:59.560 --> 11:04.096
Recently, our team published

11:04.128 --> 11:08.090
a five year strategic plan listing five key

11:08.540 --> 11:12.600
organizational priorities. One was public safety.

11:13.180 --> 11:17.376
Building community trust was two. Three was professional development.

11:17.508 --> 11:21.020
Four was Operational Excellence

11:21.440 --> 11:25.192
and five was productivity. This budget proposal

11:25.336 --> 11:28.876
funding request for key initiatives discussed in

11:28.898 --> 11:32.748
this plan, which are first ePROs

11:32.844 --> 11:37.360
and that is employment programs for retired officers.

11:38.260 --> 11:41.836
42 individuals will come back as retired officers

11:41.868 --> 11:45.796
and it will give us immediate assistance in investigations and

11:45.818 --> 11:49.456
other administrative duties. Five cadet classes budgeted

11:49.488 --> 11:53.264
for 75 per class. A gun intelligence

11:53.312 --> 11:56.520
center. We're working with Atl to implement

11:56.940 --> 12:00.168
a robust gun intelligence center. And also

12:00.334 --> 12:04.708
cell phones. Continued cell phones for each classified

12:04.804 --> 12:08.460
officer previously. This is funded by the

12:08.610 --> 12:11.676
Cares Act. I would

12:11.698 --> 12:15.896
like to now ask Ms. Smith, our Chief Financial Officer,

12:15.928 --> 12:20.284
to provide an overview of the 2023 proposed

12:20.332 --> 12:23.856
budget. Thank you. Thank you,

12:23.878 --> 12:26.370
Chief. Good morning everyone.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.512
My name is Rhonda. Smith, as the chief has said.

12:30.566 --> 12:33.928
And I am the deputy director for the Houston Police Department.

12:34.044 --> 12:38.432
And I echo Chief Sinner's sentiment

12:38.496 --> 12:42.068
in terms of working with such a great crew. And so I

12:42.074 --> 12:45.588
want to take just a minute point of privilege to talk about the Office of

12:45.594 --> 12:49.000
Budget and Finance who've been working tirelessly throughout the year

12:49.070 --> 12:52.916
and particularly now for the budget presentation. So I'm

12:52.948 --> 12:56.170
going to ask them just to stand so I can acknowledge them.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.376
So we're always behind the scenes, so they are a little shy,

13:04.568 --> 13:07.948
but thank you. So as we move forward,

13:08.114 --> 13:11.836
this first slide is the revenue by fund. First, I'd like to just say

13:11.858 --> 13:15.040
that the police department operates under six

13:15.110 --> 13:19.456
funds. The primary fund is the general fund, which makes up about 97%

13:19.558 --> 13:23.584
of our operations. The other funds are special funds. And so each fund

13:23.622 --> 13:27.936
has a revenue component. And this is what you see here on this slide.

13:28.048 --> 13:31.524
So for the first item, general fund and I'll be

13:31.562 --> 13:35.244
speaking from the column that's titled Fiscal Year 23 proposed Budget

13:35.392 --> 13:39.412
for the General Fund. The proposed revenue

13:39.476 --> 13:42.952
anticipated is $43.5 million.

13:43.086 --> 13:46.340
Now, it's revenue, but it's actually a reimbursement.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.884
84% of that is the reimbursement that we receive from

13:49.922 --> 13:54.168
the airport systems. So we provide those services for intercontinental

13:54.264 --> 13:58.060
hobby and the Ellington field. The next

13:58.130 --> 14:01.100
item is our police special services fund.

14:01.250 --> 14:04.864
This is a collection of special funds for restricted use.

14:05.062 --> 14:08.076
For example, all of the training that we do that is provided

14:08.108 --> 14:11.024
by the state flows through this fund,

14:11.142 --> 14:14.656
reimbursement for what's called MoUs, or Memorandum

14:14.688 --> 14:19.024
of Understanding, which we have with other agencies,

14:19.152 --> 14:23.428
flow through this fund and funding for our combat against

14:23.514 --> 14:27.624
human trafficking, as well as cost recovery services and

14:27.662 --> 14:29.800
special funds and special events.

14:31.660 --> 14:35.208
We anticipate that that budget would be 7.9 million.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.208
And our next item, our special fund is auto dealers.

14:39.304 --> 14:43.532
And for revenue for that one, we are anticipating 8.5

14:43.666 --> 14:46.620
budgeted for the auto dealers. And of course,

14:46.690 --> 14:49.150
with auto dealers, it's a standalone fund.

14:49.940 --> 14:53.772
And this fund is responsible for regulating automotive businesses,

14:53.836 --> 14:57.100
auto salespersons, storage lots, and towing industry.

14:57.180 --> 15:00.784
So the revenue we receive primarily is coming from fees that we

15:00.822 --> 15:03.970
charge in servicing that process.

15:04.760 --> 15:08.244
Our next item is child safety fund. And that's clearly just a

15:08.282 --> 15:12.676
flow through. Just for by way of background, in 1991,

15:12.778 --> 15:16.760
the state legislature required that any population over 850,000

15:16.830 --> 15:20.424
should fund it. And we fund it through assessing certain

15:20.462 --> 15:24.216
fees on municipal fines. And so

15:24.318 --> 15:27.816
what we get, we pass back through. And if we don't get

15:27.838 --> 15:31.596
enough, then there's no money else, no other way

15:31.618 --> 15:35.548
to get the funding. And so that's what that child safety fund is.

15:35.634 --> 15:39.980
And of course, asset forfeiture. So under asset forfeiture.

15:40.560 --> 15:44.128
The one thing I'll say, and I know my stuff is looking at me because

15:44.214 --> 15:48.220
we cannot budget for asset forfeiture

15:48.300 --> 15:51.712
because it's on a case by case basis other than the state

15:51.766 --> 15:55.796
allows us to do some budgeting. But I will say that typically right

15:55.818 --> 15:59.460
now, we're budgeting $2 million, which is, if you look in the history,

15:59.530 --> 16:03.156
it's a little lower than anticipated. But what has happened is

16:03.178 --> 16:06.744
that we are taking the same impact everyone else is with

16:06.782 --> 16:10.456
COVID and the court systems, because in order to receive these

16:10.478 --> 16:14.104
funds, it has to flow through the court system.

16:14.222 --> 16:18.076
So we're hoping that in time that we will be back

16:18.098 --> 16:21.800
on chart. And lastly is the Forensic

16:21.880 --> 16:26.780
Transition fund. And that Forensic Transition Fund that shows 373,000,000

16:26.850 --> 16:30.728
is really just a flow through because back

16:30.754 --> 16:33.984
in 2014, I believe we transitioned the

16:34.022 --> 16:37.680
operations of the Forensic Fund to the local government

16:37.750 --> 16:41.664
corporation. But we kept the funding, we kept the actual

16:41.782 --> 16:45.620
individuals that were associated with HPD

16:47.400 --> 16:50.688
in our funding. So we received reimbursement.

16:50.784 --> 16:54.004
So the good news is it's doing what it's supposed to. It was

16:54.042 --> 16:57.704
a transition. It started with probably more than 20. Now we only have three

16:57.742 --> 17:01.384
staff left. So we anticipate over the next several years that that

17:01.422 --> 17:05.112
will move down. So what we have in total is $65

17:05.166 --> 17:07.848
million for revenue. Next slide,

17:07.864 --> 17:11.628
please. So this

17:11.794 --> 17:15.132
slide just highlights some of the reasons why there's a difference

17:15.266 --> 17:19.112
from year to year and the comparison is with the estimated

17:19.176 --> 17:23.264
revenue compared to the budget. So for General Fund we're showing a $1.4

17:23.302 --> 17:26.976
million increase. As I mentioned before, 84% of the

17:26.998 --> 17:30.716
General Fund revenue has to do with our services to the police,

17:30.748 --> 17:34.116
of services to the airport system. So of course a lot of the

17:34.138 --> 17:37.248
increase has to do with the contractual obligations.

17:37.344 --> 17:40.816
In reference to the 4% increase for police

17:40.848 --> 17:44.644
and the 3% for civilian. The one thing

17:44.682 --> 17:48.040
I will highlight that the one new add on

17:48.110 --> 17:51.592
is seven positions anticipated for

17:51.646 --> 17:54.964
the last five months of the fiscal year that have to do with the integrated

17:55.012 --> 17:58.856
coordination center which is being created by the airport system

17:58.958 --> 18:03.208
and they have requested our participation in that, but of course they will be reimbursing

18:03.224 --> 18:06.716
us for it. So I'm going to skip to auto dealers and

18:06.738 --> 18:10.192
you'll see a small decrease. But really that's just because

18:10.246 --> 18:14.304
fiscal year 22 we saw uptick in the

18:14.342 --> 18:18.736
increase of selling cars that have been stored and

18:18.918 --> 18:22.304
the actual funding for that. So we tend to

18:22.342 --> 18:26.244
budget pretty conservatively. So we've gone back to what

18:26.282 --> 18:30.464
we typically would see during a year. And the last item

18:30.512 --> 18:34.180
that I will include is the forensic transition. But I've already explained that one

18:34.250 --> 18:37.770
why that's going down, so next slide please.

18:39.740 --> 18:44.024
So this is the expenditure by fund. So for General Fund,

18:44.222 --> 18:47.800
the proposed budget is $988,000,000

18:47.950 --> 18:51.148
or a difference of 33 million.

18:51.314 --> 18:55.020
And I will explain that a little bit later on

18:55.090 --> 18:58.892
and go into a little bit more detail. In terms of the general budget for

18:58.946 --> 19:02.688
police special Fund, we have a budget of $10.9

19:02.854 --> 19:06.272
million and most of that is personnel. But we do also

19:06.326 --> 19:09.964
have some increases because of technology increase,

19:10.012 --> 19:13.650
technology enhancements that we are anticipating this fiscal year.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.136
The only other thing that I will focus on is asset

19:19.168 --> 19:23.268
forfeiture, but I think I've kind of mentioned that before and why that number

19:23.434 --> 19:26.772
appears to be going up, but we didn't spend as much last year,

19:26.826 --> 19:29.576
but we do anticipate spending a little bit more this year.

19:29.758 --> 19:31.530
Thank you. Next slide please.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.656
This is the expenditure highlights which shows the difference.

19:35.758 --> 19:39.112
As I mentioned with General Fund there's a $33 million difference

19:39.166 --> 19:42.716
which I'll go in into the next slide and I

19:42.738 --> 19:46.012
believe I've already explained the differences in the others. So I'll move

19:46.066 --> 19:49.372
forward with the next slide please. So this

19:49.426 --> 19:53.004
is the slide that explains how we came

19:53.042 --> 19:56.912
up to the 988,000,000. If you recall, last year

19:56.966 --> 20:00.896
we had a budget adopted of 955,000,000 and

20:00.918 --> 20:03.528
throughout the year there are adjustments to the budget.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.960
For example, there are adjustments in the restricted funds

20:07.120 --> 20:10.784
that are shared funds that we are provided

20:10.832 --> 20:14.276
that number from the administration. And then we of

20:14.298 --> 20:17.768
course we have the adjustment for the 3%

20:17.854 --> 20:21.272
increase for the Hope budget is what I'd like to refer

20:21.326 --> 20:24.744
to as the three three three that we're all very ecstatic to

20:24.862 --> 20:28.348
see happen. And then we had a decrease in

20:28.354 --> 20:32.156
our health benefit. So that's primarily because

20:32.258 --> 20:35.516
we had a lot of more attrition than anticipated. So the

20:35.538 --> 20:38.924
budget was adjusted to reflect that decrease for health

20:38.962 --> 20:44.476
benefits. Then of course we have the Council council

20:44.508 --> 20:50.256
support monies that we've received about $129,000 and

20:50.278 --> 20:53.616
then that gets you and, and of course I can't, I would be remiss

20:53.648 --> 20:58.070
if I didn't add on that. We added the

20:59.800 --> 21:03.556
gunshot detection with the shot spotter and those

21:03.578 --> 21:07.540
are two locations at 350 each. So that's the 700,000.

21:07.690 --> 21:10.932
So that gets us down to what we refer to as the current budget.

21:10.996 --> 21:14.536
And the current budget is just the adopted plus any adjustments we've made during the

21:14.558 --> 21:18.632
year. And from there we get down to how we came

21:18.686 --> 21:22.300
to the current budget, to the fiscal year budget.

21:22.960 --> 21:26.124
And this pretty much shows you every item that

21:26.162 --> 21:30.430
has been adjusted. A lot of it has to do with the Hope and

21:32.160 --> 21:36.176
the contract with the police union HPU in

21:36.198 --> 21:39.696
terms of the increases, the 4% and the 3%. And of course

21:39.718 --> 21:43.010
we had an increase in the health care also.

21:43.860 --> 21:47.284
So I'm not going to go through each one. I wanted to just highlight those

21:47.322 --> 21:50.676
items that may bring up some question if you look

21:50.698 --> 21:54.624
about halfway down there's, the Cadet adjustment.

21:54.752 --> 21:58.296
So last year we had anticipated six classes, but we

21:58.318 --> 22:01.700
now know that filling up the five classes is our priority.

22:01.780 --> 22:05.124
So we readjusted that down to five classes

22:05.172 --> 22:09.544
versus six classes. And then the

22:09.582 --> 22:13.356
last several items here, it's called approved PBJs and

22:13.378 --> 22:16.632
those are requests that we've made to adjust our budget.

22:16.696 --> 22:20.396
And I'm happy to say that we had four this year. One had to do

22:20.418 --> 22:23.804
with the body worn cameras, which was approved this last fiscal

22:23.852 --> 22:26.896
year. And this 1.8 represents the

22:26.918 --> 22:30.700
storage cost for the body worn cameras.

22:30.860 --> 22:34.470
And of course, the Chief mentioned the ePRO program also.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.870
Next slide, please.

22:39.800 --> 22:43.584
So this slide represents the balance

22:43.632 --> 22:47.812
between personnel cost and non personnel costs. So interesting enough,

22:47.866 --> 22:51.576
we have 988,000,091% of

22:51.598 --> 22:55.464
that pertains to personnel cost. Last year was about 92,

22:55.502 --> 22:59.052
93%. And you may ask what's happened? Well,

22:59.106 --> 23:02.540
we've got the ePROs program and we also have

23:02.690 --> 23:06.588
another program, I can't remember the name, but the other program

23:06.674 --> 23:09.964
which actually has added to the other

23:10.002 --> 23:13.344
side of it. So now it's 91%. So it's going in the right

23:13.382 --> 23:15.890
direction. Next slide, please.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.584
So I'm going to move through these pretty quickly because if you see with

23:19.622 --> 23:22.752
the special funds, it's mostly 50

23:22.806 --> 23:25.628
50, mostly personnel and non personnel,

23:25.724 --> 23:29.444
it's about 50 50. So with the Police special fund it is

23:29.482 --> 23:33.664
52% for personnel and 48% for non

23:33.712 --> 23:37.428
personnel and special funds. A lot of the personnel

23:37.524 --> 23:41.236
has to do with overtime. There are some staff, but it's

23:41.268 --> 23:45.160
primarily overtime cost that we receive fund

23:45.230 --> 23:49.256
reimbursement for. Next slide please. So this is asset

23:49.288 --> 23:52.444
forfeiture. It's the same case as 50 50

23:52.562 --> 23:56.488
just about and that's personnel versus non personnel.

23:56.664 --> 23:59.956
So next slide please. And this is the auto

24:00.008 --> 24:04.160
dealers. The same with this one

24:04.230 --> 24:06.800
in terms of personnel versus non personnel.

24:07.540 --> 24:11.216
Next slide please. So we've put these two on

24:11.238 --> 24:15.024
the same slide. The first one is a child safety and of course that's

24:15.072 --> 24:18.740
strictly a flow through. So it's 100% or

24:18.810 --> 24:22.870
almost 100% flow through for services

24:23.240 --> 24:26.680
and for the forensic, it's 100% personnel.

24:28.140 --> 24:31.604
Next slide, please. So this gives you a historical

24:31.652 --> 24:35.252
factor in terms of how we have fared in comparison

24:35.316 --> 24:38.856
with what we've spent versus our adopted budget. And as you

24:38.878 --> 24:41.928
can see that we typically come on budget.

24:42.024 --> 24:45.292
We spend a lot of time making sure that we stay within

24:45.346 --> 24:49.560
our budget. We understand the budgets are tight and we are fiscally responsible

24:49.640 --> 24:53.824
and we want to make sure that we stand here. So this actual

24:54.022 --> 24:57.260
presentation shows that in a graphical manner.

24:57.420 --> 25:01.184
Next slide. So the next few slides you'll see that

25:01.222 --> 25:04.188
the adopted budget is much more than the expenditures.

25:04.284 --> 25:08.404
A lot of times with the special funds, if we do not have

25:08.442 --> 25:11.776
enough time to spend the money, it's just rolled over to the next fiscal

25:11.808 --> 25:15.584
year and that's happened in the first five years of 2019

25:15.632 --> 25:19.064
through 2023. Next slide please.

25:19.262 --> 25:23.096
The same with asset forfeiture you'll see that same trend, but we

25:23.118 --> 25:26.856
are working to make sure that the revenue and

25:27.038 --> 25:30.604
the adopted budget and the expenditures are in

25:30.642 --> 25:34.350
line, but there are some times when we run out of time.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.716
Next slide, please. And this is the

25:38.738 --> 25:41.520
auto dealers, which is typically on target.

25:44.420 --> 25:48.556
Next slide, please. And of course it's the child safety

25:48.668 --> 25:52.960
which is a smaller funds. Next slide.

25:53.960 --> 25:57.124
So with that, I'm going to pass it back over to Chief if

25:57.162 --> 26:01.430
he'd like to close us out. Just again, thanks for

26:01.880 --> 26:05.656
the support of our council members and the citizens as

26:05.678 --> 26:09.368
well. But we really wanted to kind of move through quickly because I wanted to

26:09.374 --> 26:11.960
save time for questions and answers.

26:14.540 --> 26:17.640
Thanks again, Ms. Jones. And Chief Finner.

26:18.940 --> 26:22.204
It's not every day that we have the opportunity to have you

26:22.242 --> 26:27.656
and your command staff in front of us. So again, I'd like to recognize Chief

26:27.688 --> 26:31.276
Slinkert, chief Jones and Chief Satellite, and also

26:31.458 --> 26:34.784
Ray Hunt and Doug Griffin with HPOU who are

26:34.822 --> 26:38.912
valuable partners not only to the police department but to the city council as well.

26:39.046 --> 26:43.164
And also Mr. Peter Stout with the CEO of the Houston

26:43.212 --> 26:47.056
Forensic Science Lab. Our first question comes from council member Abby

26:47.088 --> 26:50.516
Cayman. Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. And I

26:50.538 --> 26:53.700
have a list of questions, so just go ahead and put me back in queue.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.880
Chief, first off, thank you so much for your leadership and to the entire

26:57.950 --> 27:02.456
team all the way on down to each division as

27:02.478 --> 27:06.504
we continue to face not only the

27:06.542 --> 27:10.156
surgeon violent crime following the pandemic locally. But could

27:10.178 --> 27:13.180
you share what you're seeing? I know you were just in DC,

27:14.400 --> 27:18.430
what that trip was about and what we're seeing nationally and how

27:18.960 --> 27:22.032
what we are doing is either working or not working.

27:22.166 --> 27:26.592
Thank you for asking. It was a good trip for

27:26.726 --> 27:30.924
not only me, but for the mayor and for our city and visiting

27:30.972 --> 27:34.944
with the President, the Rescue

27:34.992 --> 27:38.436
Act, he pledged to continue to

27:38.458 --> 27:42.720
fund us, and that was a huge thing. But the meeting,

27:42.880 --> 27:45.972
first of all, I just want to say honor to

27:46.106 --> 27:50.616
those men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice during

27:50.638 --> 27:55.976
that weekend of memorial. But when

27:55.998 --> 27:58.680
you're talking to other chiefs from around the nation,

27:58.840 --> 28:02.604
you understand that everybody has the same problems,

28:02.802 --> 28:06.476
with one exception. Nobody has the backlog problem that we

28:06.498 --> 28:10.276
have here in Houston, Harris County. Absolutely nobody.

28:10.408 --> 28:13.756
And in our conversations, they were amazed. But they're

28:13.788 --> 28:16.880
dealing with some of the same other issues, the gun violence,

28:18.420 --> 28:22.616
letting individuals out of jail when they're

28:22.748 --> 28:25.680
repeating time and time, violent crime.

28:25.760 --> 28:29.460
So that's the challenge. But also recruiting

28:30.520 --> 28:34.276
and just hearing some of the things that they're doing. And I told the

28:34.298 --> 28:37.496
mayor that I think I'll meet this Thursday. I want to talk to

28:37.518 --> 28:41.844
him about some of the recruiting initiatives

28:41.892 --> 28:45.944
that they are putting in place and also probably

28:46.142 --> 28:49.676
using as more funding comes in, using some

28:49.698 --> 28:53.096
of that for some incentives for individuals

28:53.128 --> 28:56.584
coming in to the academy or actually recruiting

28:56.632 --> 29:01.400
them. Mentioned recruitment.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.608
There's been conversations and questions about cadet classes. And I

29:04.614 --> 29:07.920
know you mentioned in this budget there's five, is that correct?

29:08.070 --> 29:11.756
And could you clarify, though, because we oftentimes

29:11.788 --> 29:15.920
talk about cadet classes, but we also are dealing with retention

29:16.000 --> 29:19.636
issues. So can you share with us where that brings us in

29:19.658 --> 29:21.380
terms of HPD?

29:22.600 --> 29:26.240
Yes, staffing, the recruiting,

29:26.400 --> 29:30.004
we can always improve. But the biggest problem right

29:30.042 --> 29:34.280
now is the Attrition Rate We're Agent Agency and

29:34.350 --> 29:37.640
a lot of these individuals who are leaving when they get 35,

29:37.710 --> 29:40.876
30 years, it's hard to keep them

29:40.898 --> 29:44.476
when they're ready to go. So as we put cadets in the

29:44.498 --> 29:48.764
class on the back end, people are retiring. So that is a

29:48.802 --> 29:51.170
huge challenge right now.

29:52.020 --> 29:56.224
So it's very important that we just don't lose hope and understand

29:56.342 --> 29:59.664
and hoping that that time itself out as some

29:59.702 --> 30:03.660
of those retire and then other cadets

30:03.820 --> 30:07.632
come through our academy and come on out on the streets.

30:07.776 --> 30:10.724
Hopefully on the back end, in a few years, we'll be able to hold on

30:10.762 --> 30:14.356
to a lot more for a longer time. It's not just

30:14.378 --> 30:17.720
that we're adding additional numbers. We'll put you back in queue.

30:19.020 --> 30:21.080
Council Member Sally Alcorn.

30:22.540 --> 30:25.800
Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Chief, for the presentation.

30:27.020 --> 30:30.740
I have a question about investigative and special operations.

30:30.900 --> 30:34.296
I know there was talk about clearance rates and how we were doing better ten

30:34.318 --> 30:37.768
years ago than we were doing now.

30:37.934 --> 30:44.476
And we added, I thought some classifieds

30:44.508 --> 30:47.984
to that division. It looks like we budgeted for

30:48.022 --> 30:51.536
more last year and then hired fewer, and now we're trying

30:51.558 --> 30:55.156
to get more. Can you talk a little bit about yeah, I'm proud to say

30:55.258 --> 30:59.104
that our clearance rate, divisional clearance rate and homicide

30:59.152 --> 31:01.430
is at 80% now. That's great.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.890
When you looked at last year in 2020,

31:07.500 --> 31:11.780
those numbers were down. So we're trending in the right direction.

31:11.940 --> 31:15.732
I want to give credit to the great investigative

31:15.796 --> 31:19.292
work and also the leadership on the investigative side,

31:19.426 --> 31:23.036
chief Jones and some of our other assistant chiefs and the men and

31:23.058 --> 31:27.390
women who are doing just knockout investigations. But again,

31:28.320 --> 31:31.984
people don't give enough credit to the value of

31:32.102 --> 31:34.876
good relationships with citizens.

31:35.068 --> 31:38.576
And you see time and time again, citizens are stepping up

31:38.598 --> 31:43.072
more. And I think that's because of a better relationship and

31:43.126 --> 31:46.336
more trust building in. So it has to

31:46.358 --> 31:49.588
all gel together. But I'm excited about it, and I

31:49.594 --> 31:52.996
just pray that we continue to trend that way. That's great news. Good to

31:53.018 --> 31:57.248
hear. On the property room, how many classifieds

31:57.264 --> 32:00.536
do we have working at the property room? I'm not sure on that number.

32:00.638 --> 32:04.264
Does anybody have a property room? And if not, we'll get that to you.

32:04.302 --> 32:08.040
Okay, that's great. And I'd like to see, in addition to the clearance rate

32:08.110 --> 32:11.150
be put on the performance measures that you all include in the book,

32:12.400 --> 32:16.284
the disposition of property. I know what we receive in and

32:16.322 --> 32:19.932
what goes out. I think we're way in

32:19.986 --> 32:23.184
more. We have way more in in all categories than

32:23.222 --> 32:26.748
than what goes out. And that ties up a lot of officers. We include

32:26.764 --> 32:28.560
that council member Tiffany Thomas.

32:31.380 --> 32:34.604
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. Hello, Chief. It's good to see you doing this morning.

32:34.742 --> 32:38.484
I'm well. So two questions. One's an aside from the general fund, I'm pretty

32:38.522 --> 32:41.812
clear about how you're funded, but oftentimes we

32:41.866 --> 32:45.876
receive grant where council approves grant award grant applications

32:45.908 --> 32:49.208
rather to support the department. And I remember there was one

32:49.294 --> 32:52.696
item, particularly that was almost like

32:52.718 --> 32:56.584
a community mobile unit that

32:56.622 --> 33:00.684
was the application was supposed to use

33:00.722 --> 33:04.268
to do some community efforts. When do we receive information

33:04.354 --> 33:08.044
that the award was actually accepted or funded and

33:08.082 --> 33:11.516
that those capital pieces of equipment are actually within our hands?

33:11.618 --> 33:16.480
That mobile brand? I think that got it's. Chief Johnson.

33:16.820 --> 33:20.656
Commander Johnson. We just put in for a

33:20.678 --> 33:24.128
year ago. Yeah. So we'll get some

33:24.294 --> 33:27.190
follow up on that and see what we are, because it's a great idea.

33:27.640 --> 33:31.812
We want to go to our communities because

33:31.866 --> 33:36.024
of staffing. A lot of the storefronts were closed down.

33:36.142 --> 33:38.520
So if we can have a mobile outreach,

33:39.500 --> 33:44.116
I guess I used to call them Winnebagos vehicles,

33:44.148 --> 33:48.330
but we can go directly to the community. Right. Just curious about

33:48.780 --> 33:52.364
the status of that. And then secondly, I think my first year

33:52.402 --> 33:56.124
in office, I took a tour of the forensic center. I was fascinated by it,

33:56.162 --> 33:59.070
just overwhelmed with the amount of work that they do.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.804
If I understand this, this is a decrease in their budget.

34:03.852 --> 34:07.744
Is this the variance? Is that a variance? So for what we

34:07.782 --> 34:11.472
have, it's just the number of individuals that transition over

34:11.526 --> 34:15.804
from the city to the forensics. So it's just kind of like a holding

34:15.852 --> 34:19.156
pattern because that was what was agreed upon in

34:19.178 --> 34:23.044
order to keep them with the benefits of the sure. So then this

34:23.082 --> 34:26.736
leads to my question in terms of making sure your officers

34:26.768 --> 34:30.184
on the ground are doing yeoman's work around with the homicide rate.

34:30.382 --> 34:34.600
Everyone's doing their part. That's the asset. We've asked the community

34:34.750 --> 34:38.196
what type of funding would they need in order to make sure that evidence

34:38.228 --> 34:41.868
is not backlog? All of that data collection so they can keep in

34:41.874 --> 34:45.244
track with the goals that we're setting in the city. We have to stay in

34:45.282 --> 34:49.004
communication with our forensic center as

34:49.042 --> 34:52.684
we make more arrests. There is more of a demand

34:52.732 --> 34:56.412
on them, and we need to make sure that we're meeting that demand.

34:56.476 --> 34:59.580
So we've been in communication,

34:59.740 --> 35:03.808
and I'm sure they're going to be in communication with the mayor to

35:03.894 --> 35:07.728
make sure they get what they need. Sure. Wonderful. So you're

35:07.744 --> 35:10.884
not saying we need to play the mega millions in order to get this

35:10.922 --> 35:15.088
funded? Because maybe we need to play some. I think that there should be some

35:15.274 --> 35:18.570
direct conversations on need

35:18.940 --> 35:22.564
and we need to work together as a team. And the mayor

35:22.612 --> 35:25.544
has been just stand up with that,

35:25.662 --> 35:29.480
including the council. When any of us pertaining to

35:29.550 --> 35:32.716
safety of our city needs something and we present it

35:32.738 --> 35:35.916
to everybody has been very fair, and I want us

35:35.938 --> 35:39.548
to keep doing that with all, not only HPD, but with all

35:39.634 --> 35:43.072
departments in the city. Vice Mayor Pro TEM

35:43.126 --> 35:46.940
martha Castex Tatum. Thank you, Chair. Chief Finner, thank you for the presentation.

35:47.020 --> 35:50.000
Ms. Smith, thank you for always being so very thorough.

35:52.440 --> 35:55.700
I wanted to talk a little bit about ShotSpotter.

35:56.200 --> 35:59.732
We had almost a unanimous council vote on the support

35:59.786 --> 36:03.344
of ShotSpotter. Our residents are clamoring

36:03.392 --> 36:06.260
for ShotSpotter in our communities.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.536
If you can give us some insight on the value of that and if you

36:10.558 --> 36:14.440
anticipate that the cost of Shot spotter will decrease

36:14.860 --> 36:18.412
I don't know about decreasing. We hope as we add more,

36:18.546 --> 36:21.884
we can make better deals. But it's a

36:21.922 --> 36:26.104
tremendous piece of technology, gun detection.

36:26.232 --> 36:29.996
We've had cases where when

36:30.018 --> 36:33.884
they discharge a firearm, we're immediately responding

36:33.932 --> 36:37.632
to it and we have made some arrests. So as

36:37.686 --> 36:40.608
many more as we can stand up as fund and allow.

36:40.694 --> 36:43.760
But again, you look at different cities,

36:43.920 --> 36:48.848
it's not just the city government responsibility.

36:49.024 --> 36:52.564
Everybody has to kick in corporations so

36:52.602 --> 36:56.120
we can stand up more, but it's something that's needed and wanted

36:56.190 --> 37:00.804
by the chief and our men and women in uniform. So it's

37:00.932 --> 37:05.592
something I hope we can find more. But also the

37:05.646 --> 37:09.164
corporations and private entities step up and assist us

37:09.202 --> 37:12.844
with. That. And then I wanted to talk about the

37:12.882 --> 37:16.696
rollout of the outward facing cameras.

37:16.888 --> 37:20.092
If we can eventually come back to maybe

37:20.146 --> 37:23.536
public safety once that 90 day period is

37:23.558 --> 37:27.596
up, to talk about those places that have installed

37:27.628 --> 37:31.376
those cameras or the ones that have not. What we need to do to make

37:31.398 --> 37:35.476
sure that we are enforcing that ordinance. One of the biggest complaints we

37:35.498 --> 37:39.172
have in our district is the nuisance that

37:39.226 --> 37:43.284
is created at a lot of those convenience stores. And when you let

37:43.322 --> 37:46.836
that petty crime go on, it leads to bigger crime. So I think we

37:46.858 --> 37:50.276
are headed in the right direction with those ordinances.

37:50.388 --> 37:54.472
And we appreciate all that you and your entire team

37:54.526 --> 37:57.396
is doing to keep us all safe in the city of Houston. Thank you.

37:57.438 --> 38:01.304
Council Member we're very intentional on holding those convenience

38:01.352 --> 38:03.404
stores, bars, and anybody, any,

38:03.522 --> 38:06.844
established accountable for helping us fight

38:06.882 --> 38:09.816
crime. Council member.

38:09.848 --> 38:13.296
Leticia plummer. Thank you so much. Mayor Person. Thank you,

38:13.318 --> 38:17.056
Chief. Good morning. Good morning. Two questions. What is

38:17.078 --> 38:19.120
the retention rate of our cadets?

38:21.300 --> 38:25.030
Do they stay with the force? Have we found that? You know,

38:26.040 --> 38:29.748
I had some let me see if I had some numbers. When did they

38:29.754 --> 38:30.580
graduate?

38:34.280 --> 38:37.610
I forgot where I was on my page. I looked at it.

38:44.360 --> 38:48.740
Be specific. When they graduate. Yes. Let me get you a percentage.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.840
I know we have it somewhere here, but we'll get that to you.

38:52.910 --> 38:56.052
Absolutely. Okay, wonderful. Thank you. I would like to know that you're looking at graduation

38:56.116 --> 38:59.144
rate. How long? Stay on the course. Okay,

38:59.182 --> 39:02.548
I got you. What's the retention rate of our graduates?

39:02.644 --> 39:06.092
Because we're paying for them to be trained. Right. Got you. Okay. And then

39:06.146 --> 39:09.596
what would that look like in terms of increasing that number, whatever that

39:09.618 --> 39:13.884
is? We can talk offline on that. The other question is, you mentioned the

39:13.922 --> 39:17.070
Biden administration. Congratulations on meeting with the President.

39:17.440 --> 39:20.588
Thank you. Just honestly, I hear that we

39:20.594 --> 39:24.248
can put thousands of officers on the ground, but if we don't get forensics funded

39:24.344 --> 39:27.956
properly, it leads to two issues. Right. The backlog is

39:27.978 --> 39:30.356
going to continue to increase, and then people are going to be falsely accused for

39:30.378 --> 39:33.572
issues. Yes. So my question to you is maybe this is a not right now

39:33.626 --> 39:37.428
question, but I would love to see our forensics department get the money that

39:37.434 --> 39:41.048
they need. I think they need I think they're short, like, $9 million to

39:41.134 --> 39:44.890
fill that, to get that backlog handled. And also

39:47.340 --> 39:50.952
training and funding going

39:51.006 --> 39:53.964
toward our officers that collect the data,

39:54.162 --> 39:58.716
specimens, et cetera, on the ground so

39:58.738 --> 40:01.724
we can make sure whatever is collected is collected properly. Yes.

40:01.762 --> 40:05.628
And our officers are going to need training and all that they need to

40:05.634 --> 40:08.976
do to that do that well. So those are two things I

40:08.998 --> 40:11.010
would love to see line items for. Yes.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.996
Okay. Thank you. Council Member Carolyn Evan

40:16.028 --> 40:19.508
Shabaz. Thank you, Mayor Pro tim and I believe

40:19.594 --> 40:23.748
last year, council Member Pollard gave 50,000,

40:23.834 --> 40:27.364
I think, to the forensics unit. And I would like to,

40:27.482 --> 40:31.224
like they say, follow that cab. I'd like to do that as well from

40:31.262 --> 40:34.916
my council district service funds. And I urge other council

40:34.948 --> 40:38.628
members to look at that as well, because we're

40:38.644 --> 40:42.344
going to have to get these cases, get the information

40:42.462 --> 40:45.756
that is given to us examined in order to

40:45.778 --> 40:49.070
move through the court system. And so I would like to

40:49.680 --> 40:53.372
say that and challenge my colleagues to do the same.

40:53.506 --> 40:57.276
Thank you. Council member Tasha

40:57.308 --> 41:00.384
Jackson. Thank you.

41:00.582 --> 41:04.320
Hey, Chief. How are you? Good morning, Council. So I have three questions.

41:04.390 --> 41:08.064
So what is HBB's clearance rate for violent crime

41:08.112 --> 41:11.444
last year? And what is the clearance rate for

41:11.482 --> 41:14.340
crime overall? And then lastly,

41:14.760 --> 41:18.756
constituents have reached out about the cadet classes and just want

41:18.778 --> 41:22.660
to know what is HBD doing to recruits

41:23.020 --> 41:27.044
from within the neighborhoods? There's a complaint

41:27.092 --> 41:31.076
that concern that the officers that's patrolling

41:31.108 --> 41:34.612
the neighborhoods do not reflect the race,

41:34.676 --> 41:38.056
the people that they're so they want to see more black officers

41:38.088 --> 41:41.320
in the district. What are we doing to recruit

41:41.400 --> 41:45.096
the black officer? Let me start with the clearance

41:45.128 --> 41:48.160
rates. I went over the homicide. I'll have to get back with you,

41:48.230 --> 41:52.080
and we'll get some time in the day. On the other clearance rates

41:52.500 --> 41:56.370
for violent crimes. In terms of

41:57.860 --> 42:00.848
pacifically African American officers,

42:01.024 --> 42:05.056
the first thing I want to do is make sure that we're recruiting good officers.

42:05.088 --> 42:09.140
I want to look at that heart. But I understand when you have

42:09.290 --> 42:12.676
officers from the community who are committed, who knows

42:12.708 --> 42:16.216
the community, it helps. So we

42:16.238 --> 42:19.736
are doing everything we can to increase the

42:19.758 --> 42:24.156
diversity in our agency. But I also do

42:24.178 --> 42:27.416
not, and I say this with a lot of respect,

42:27.608 --> 42:31.720
I don't ever want to discount the contributions

42:31.800 --> 42:35.324
of non minority officers with our

42:35.362 --> 42:39.168
agency. And I know that you're not accident or saying that, but I want to

42:39.174 --> 42:42.880
acknowledge their work because they have been in our communities doing

42:42.950 --> 42:45.632
all much work for 25,

42:45.686 --> 42:49.428
35 years without any complaints and

42:49.514 --> 42:52.784
retired honorably. So I do want to acknowledge

42:52.832 --> 42:57.808
that. But at the same time, what are we doing to increase minorities?

42:57.984 --> 43:01.524
We're going out to where they are, the universities.

43:01.652 --> 43:04.488
Let me stop. Keep going. Okay,

43:04.654 --> 43:07.700
universities. Some of the radio stations,

43:07.780 --> 43:11.836
hip hop radio stations, wherever they

43:11.858 --> 43:16.364
are, we instituted not

43:16.402 --> 43:20.444
the word study, but the

43:20.482 --> 43:24.510
life program. What is it, life history,

43:25.120 --> 43:28.464
where you get an individual and I'll get this

43:28.502 --> 43:31.968
quick example. We had at first,

43:32.054 --> 43:35.756
you had to have so many college hours or you had to be honorably discharged

43:35.788 --> 43:39.044
from the military. What about the young man and young lady that worked

43:39.082 --> 43:42.356
at Ups or any other job for five years and

43:42.378 --> 43:46.144
is a great individual? And we say in our agency,

43:46.192 --> 43:49.908
well, you don't have a college, you don't have a military, we don't want you.

43:49.994 --> 43:53.352
We did away with that. Okay? So we're looking at other ways

43:53.406 --> 43:57.256
that we can recruit not only minorities, but anybody

43:57.358 --> 44:00.936
to increase that pool. And we'll continue to do that. But I

44:00.958 --> 44:04.424
need help from council members and everybody else in our

44:04.462 --> 44:07.928
community. It's just not the job of the police department.

44:08.024 --> 44:10.860
I need you all to advocate for us, and I know you all do,

44:11.010 --> 44:15.036
but all citizens. It is a great career, and I know people

44:15.138 --> 44:18.332
don't think that sometimes because they listen to the negative,

44:18.396 --> 44:22.144
but this is an honorable profession, and we'll continue to do whatever we can

44:22.182 --> 44:24.850
increase those numbers. All right,

44:25.540 --> 44:29.220
so before we go to second round of questions from council members,

44:29.370 --> 44:32.736
I have a couple of questions, and it's related to some of the comments

44:32.768 --> 44:36.564
you made, specifically backlog and more demand on

44:36.602 --> 44:39.190
the Houston Forensic Science Center.

44:40.860 --> 44:44.644
Over the past couple of years, we've become very aware of a significant

44:44.692 --> 44:48.148
backlog in forensic lab testing, mostly due

44:48.164 --> 44:52.300
to COVID, mostly due to a halt in court operations,

44:52.960 --> 44:56.636
increase in homicides. We have job openings that

44:56.658 --> 45:00.012
we can't fill. What can we do?

45:00.066 --> 45:04.088
Because it seems as though the testing that we're doing today won't

45:04.104 --> 45:07.776
be available for three years. So to council Member Plummer's point and

45:07.798 --> 45:11.280
to council member Evan Shabbaz's point, if we arrest someone

45:11.350 --> 45:14.400
today for a homicide or whatever, do some testing,

45:14.980 --> 45:19.012
it's not for three years that this person actually goes

45:19.066 --> 45:23.284
to court. Thus we're seeing a lot of bad

45:23.322 --> 45:26.868
people going back on the streets. So when people talk about

45:27.034 --> 45:30.280
violence, I will point

45:30.350 --> 45:33.796
to the courts, the judicial system in the city of Houston

45:33.828 --> 45:37.652
and Harris County, but we also have to look at the Houston

45:37.716 --> 45:40.984
Forensics Science Lab. So what

45:41.022 --> 45:44.604
can we do to make sure that we get these bad

45:44.642 --> 45:48.364
guys to trial quicker with forensic evidence and

45:48.402 --> 45:51.452
get them off the streets? Merrick pro TEM.

45:51.506 --> 45:54.688
I don't want to speak for them, but whatever we do,

45:54.854 --> 45:58.064
we need to make sure that we're working together to

45:58.102 --> 46:01.804
make sure that there's properly staffing

46:01.852 --> 46:05.500
and funding of that. I don't know all the operations

46:05.580 --> 46:09.188
over there, but just as we support the

46:09.194 --> 46:13.056
police officers, we got to support all the departments,

46:13.168 --> 46:16.276
and they need some help over there. And again,

46:16.458 --> 46:20.836
I think the mayor, when it's bought to him and

46:20.938 --> 46:24.424
laid out, he's going to make the right decision, and I'm sure

46:24.462 --> 46:28.136
that city council will support it. So as

46:28.158 --> 46:31.210
a non police guy, I'm going to draw a parallel between

46:31.600 --> 46:35.052
forensic testing backlog and number

46:35.106 --> 46:39.068
of criminals that are on the streets. So until we get

46:39.154 --> 46:42.988
part a solved, we're going to constantly see more bad guys on the

46:42.994 --> 46:46.880
streets. So I'll point to something. We gave you a million dollars

46:46.950 --> 46:51.564
in ARPA funds for buyback guns. Has that program been successful?

46:51.692 --> 46:55.296
How many guns have we bought back? And specifically, how many dollars have

46:55.318 --> 46:58.870
we spent on that buyback program? We're still standing it up.

46:59.480 --> 47:02.390
It was a lot dealing with it. You know,

47:03.000 --> 47:06.900
right now we're running all of our guns through the

47:06.970 --> 47:10.232
knob and system. So I want to do that.

47:10.286 --> 47:13.944
But in a gun buyback program,

47:14.142 --> 47:18.264
you can't get any identification from the people. What I understand,

47:18.462 --> 47:22.488
but I still want to run those guns, so it's a

47:22.494 --> 47:26.028
bit complicated, and I

47:26.034 --> 47:30.088
got ms. Cloud is not here with our community affairs.

47:30.264 --> 47:34.740
She's coordinating that with us. But we'll

47:34.760 --> 47:38.400
do whatever we can with that. Okay. Thank you, council Member Abby Cayman.

47:38.980 --> 47:41.820
Thank you, Chief.

47:41.980 --> 47:45.292
I ask every department this, and I know that in the appendix,

47:45.356 --> 47:47.190
you have a list here.

47:48.840 --> 47:52.550
HPD is doing an extraordinary job with

47:53.880 --> 47:56.980
very tough circumstances. The unmet needs

47:57.050 --> 48:00.230
of the department. I'd like you to share a little bit about that.

48:00.940 --> 48:03.988
Again, we have a certain amount in the budget.

48:04.084 --> 48:08.056
There are constraints. What are the needs? I'm looking at

48:08.078 --> 48:12.072
this list. A lot of it has to do with technology and

48:12.126 --> 48:15.384
not in the list. I talk about it all the time. I'm like the broken

48:15.432 --> 48:19.340
record about it. But CAD. RMS relies on CAD.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.836
Real time crime center has to do with CAD. So all

48:23.858 --> 48:27.360
of these can you talk about those costs, any additional needs,

48:27.430 --> 48:30.944
including facility needs for

48:30.982 --> 48:34.268
our divisions? Because those buildings

48:34.284 --> 48:37.456
are like the rest of the city right now in terms of struggling. We're in

48:37.478 --> 48:41.380
a city of a huge city. You look at our square miles.

48:41.720 --> 48:45.680
The first need, we have an aging fleet.

48:45.840 --> 48:49.750
If we get anything additional or extra money,

48:50.860 --> 48:54.564
almost 50% of our fleet is past the lifespan,

48:54.612 --> 48:58.920
and that's 100,005 years for marked 120,000

48:58.990 --> 49:03.068
miles and seven years for unmarked. Almost 50% of

49:03.074 --> 49:07.804
our vehicles are over. I was at the gas pumps before

49:07.842 --> 49:11.896
I went to DC. And there was a young female officer,

49:12.008 --> 49:15.356
and I had to apologize to her, and she drove up in that car

49:15.378 --> 49:18.816
to put gas in there. I know we're doing the best that

49:18.838 --> 49:21.650
we can do, but we have to do better.

49:22.100 --> 49:25.984
As far as a real time crime center, we do

49:26.022 --> 49:29.524
have through the Tag Center,

49:29.722 --> 49:33.204
they have pledged to fund some of the

49:33.322 --> 49:36.468
additions we need to make it a true

49:36.634 --> 49:40.708
real time crime center. We're still waiting

49:40.884 --> 49:44.296
for that money to come down. Hopefully they'll prove it and

49:44.478 --> 49:46.250
we'll move forward on that.

49:47.100 --> 49:50.010
But I would say, number one,

49:50.460 --> 49:53.996
the need for better vehicles and

49:54.018 --> 49:57.436
newer vehicles, that is a must. We're not in

49:57.458 --> 50:00.828
a city that's very small and you can do

50:00.914 --> 50:04.136
a lot of foot patrol. Even though I would love I love foot patrol.

50:04.168 --> 50:07.804
I love neighborhood policing. But the fact of the matter is,

50:07.922 --> 50:11.696
you move around in vehicles in Houston, and we need to keep up with

50:11.718 --> 50:14.592
these criminals. And the only way we're going to be able to do that is

50:14.726 --> 50:18.196
put money and funds as much as we can into the

50:18.218 --> 50:21.124
fleet and really quickly.

50:21.242 --> 50:25.380
In addition to Vice Mayor pro TEM's request on follow up on

50:25.450 --> 50:29.204
the new camera ordinance, I'd love to get an update from

50:29.242 --> 50:32.804
you all on the ATF partnership. We keep talking about

50:32.842 --> 50:37.048
violent crime, but it's guns. Yes, it is.

50:37.134 --> 50:41.080
We'll get it. Thank you. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

50:41.520 --> 50:45.052
Thank you, Chair. There was about a million for

50:45.186 --> 50:48.856
increase in temporary personnel services in the Chiefs command.

50:48.888 --> 50:52.920
Is that for a specific project or ePROs?

50:53.000 --> 50:56.696
ePROs. That's what the okay,

50:56.738 --> 50:59.776
got it. And then I just want to point out and you noticed you had

50:59.798 --> 51:03.010
it in the adjustments. This was a $2 million over

51:03.620 --> 51:07.236
budgeting of health benefits. That comes back to

51:07.258 --> 51:10.676
the department. Correct. Like last year, there was

51:10.778 --> 51:14.452
no so it was originally anticipated that

51:14.506 --> 51:18.756
there would be more staffing and that

51:18.778 --> 51:22.792
would actually adjust for the health benefits. And so the health

51:22.846 --> 51:26.664
benefits was reduced by the finance. Got it. One more thing. And on

51:26.702 --> 51:30.164
recruiting, I like the changes you made, the Ups

51:30.212 --> 51:33.628
example and all. And also, you guys spent over a million dollars, which is

51:33.634 --> 51:37.128
a really good thing. On tuition reimbursement, that should be another big recruiting

51:37.224 --> 51:41.084
thing. Any kind of incentive. I really

51:41.122 --> 51:43.790
want us to look at that as a team.

51:44.500 --> 51:47.744
It's really important. But even front

51:47.782 --> 51:51.148
end incentives. At the meeting

51:51.164 --> 51:54.640
in DC, you asked about a councilwoman.

51:55.220 --> 51:58.408
That's what I think has been working for other agencies,

51:58.444 --> 52:01.812
and it may work for us, but also to

52:01.946 --> 52:05.350
help with some of the debt. Now, the challenge is

52:05.720 --> 52:09.424
when individuals come in and we give them front end incentives

52:09.552 --> 52:13.544
and they leave, and we can say, well, hey, we require you to

52:13.582 --> 52:17.176
stay three years or five years, but when they leave, who's collecting the

52:17.198 --> 52:20.696
money? So then that's the challenge that some of the

52:20.718 --> 52:24.270
other chiefs had as well. So just want to bring that up

52:26.640 --> 52:30.588
so we have no other council members in queue. I'll ask the last questions.

52:30.674 --> 52:34.072
It really upsets me when I turn on the media and I hear comments

52:34.136 --> 52:38.380
like the murder capital of the world, and then your comment about homicides

52:38.460 --> 52:42.236
moving from 70% to 70. I had some visitors in town

52:42.348 --> 52:45.456
from my hometown of New Orleans, and they were talking about

52:45.638 --> 52:49.568
crime, murder rates, things like that. And my explanation

52:49.664 --> 52:54.944
was we have a significant problem with domestic

52:54.992 --> 52:58.564
violence. The other day I read a report where a

52:58.602 --> 53:01.796
lady approached a man with a gun. Man took it from her and shot

53:01.828 --> 53:05.656
her. I don't know anyone in the world who

53:05.678 --> 53:09.204
can stop something like that. Whether you have a police force

53:09.252 --> 53:12.890
with 2 million people or a police force with one,

53:13.200 --> 53:16.456
it seems to me like domestic violence shootings,

53:16.568 --> 53:20.172
and I'll call them homicides, are happening each and every day.

53:20.226 --> 53:23.788
So I think I understand your statistics on 70 to seven,

53:23.874 --> 53:27.528
because every time I look at the TV, the murders

53:27.544 --> 53:30.796
are related to domestic violence. So can you

53:30.818 --> 53:34.584
lend a little color to that? As far as the homicide rate? Domestic violence

53:34.632 --> 53:38.016
has ever anything we can domestic violence

53:38.128 --> 53:41.524
is one category that's driving our homicide up.

53:41.642 --> 53:45.430
But there has to be education. There has to be intervention and

53:46.200 --> 53:49.444
intervention into it. And what I mean

53:49.482 --> 53:53.224
by that, we have to make sure with our Dart program

53:53.342 --> 53:56.504
and I'm so proud of that when we have an

53:56.542 --> 53:59.636
advocate in the car with the police officer,

53:59.748 --> 54:03.484
once you go to that scene and somebody is assaulted, they still

54:03.522 --> 54:07.352
alive. It's a vicious cycle that's going to get worse.

54:07.496 --> 54:11.704
If we can lend in what we do, those resources

54:11.752 --> 54:15.328
to that victim or that complainant right away,

54:15.414 --> 54:18.050
get them out of that situation,

54:19.140 --> 54:22.272
that's the way that we save

54:22.326 --> 54:25.804
lives. But it is frustrating to police officers when we're

54:25.852 --> 54:29.216
judged. I don't know how you can prevent

54:29.248 --> 54:33.348
it when it's behind walls, but we

54:33.354 --> 54:37.204
can't forget about them. We have to do everything we can as a society to

54:37.242 --> 54:40.404
make sure that we're addressing it. And we are, but it is frustrating.

54:40.452 --> 54:44.170
It's also frustrating when people

54:44.620 --> 54:47.668
turn and they push their own narrative.

54:47.844 --> 54:51.432
What's the narrative now? How many people you talk and you hear

54:51.486 --> 54:55.484
talking about the dramatic drop in

54:55.522 --> 54:59.148
homicide rate? Okay, now we know summer is here

54:59.314 --> 55:02.636
and we know what to expect during the summer. But we're rolling up

55:02.658 --> 55:06.088
and we're going to meet the challenge. And I don't take all the credit for

55:06.114 --> 55:09.484
homicides. I said we have some good investigators and good police

55:09.532 --> 55:13.520
work, but it is truly something that this community

55:13.670 --> 55:17.548
and everybody has to partner up with us to make the city safer.

55:17.724 --> 55:21.172
But we're on the right track. And I thank you all again for all your

55:21.226 --> 55:23.620
support. Thank you. Council member Abby Cayman,

55:25.080 --> 55:28.804
I appreciate that you brought up domestic violence in chief. I'm going to assume that

55:28.842 --> 55:32.840
the over $4 million in ARPA funds that are going towards

55:32.990 --> 55:35.924
Dart, dart forensic nurses is helping.

55:35.972 --> 55:39.844
And again, hats off to Dart. Some of the most dangerous

55:39.892 --> 55:43.404
situations that they're responding to. But mayor pro TEM to your

55:43.442 --> 55:46.924
point in terms of preventative action, again,

55:46.962 --> 55:50.588
the majority of domestic violence homicides are with a firearm and

55:50.674 --> 55:54.124
we have no red flag laws the courts aren't able even to

55:54.162 --> 55:58.544
enforce right now. So if there's a record of someone perpetrating or

55:58.582 --> 56:01.996
is a domestic abuser, I'm assuming,

56:02.028 --> 56:04.690
chief, you all can't remove those firearms from that situation.

56:05.700 --> 56:09.284
Yeah, we still can move when

56:09.322 --> 56:12.800
there's evidence of violence, you can temporarily move those firearms

56:12.960 --> 56:16.532
and we do do it, but I don't dab into

56:16.586 --> 56:21.604
the politics too much. But I do want to say this lawmakers,

56:21.732 --> 56:24.948
and we talked about this in DC. Around the nation, I don't

56:24.964 --> 56:28.360
care if you're local, you state or you're federal,

56:28.780 --> 56:32.184
everybody needs to be real careful as we move through

56:32.222 --> 56:35.944
the pandemic and violent crimes. Be careful what you vote

56:35.992 --> 56:39.576
for, be careful what you write in law, okay? When there's

56:39.608 --> 56:43.388
a backlog, we need to do the best that we

56:43.394 --> 56:47.056
can do and not point fingers at reducing the

56:47.078 --> 56:51.756
guns on the street, especially in the wrong hands of individuals

56:51.788 --> 56:55.676
who commit violence after violence. Now everybody's smart

56:55.708 --> 56:59.590
in here and we read through the lines, but everybody needs to do their part.

57:00.600 --> 57:04.420
I just encourage friends and family

57:04.490 --> 57:08.416
and anybody. We need to do our part and be smart about gun

57:08.448 --> 57:10.250
violence. We really do.

57:11.820 --> 57:14.488
Council member Tiffany Thomas. Thank you.

57:14.574 --> 57:17.860
Mayor Pro tim raised a really good point about the domestic violence,

57:18.020 --> 57:22.888
but I can't help to think about active shooter issues

57:22.974 --> 57:26.684
happening, and I know there was some in north Harris County. Buffalo is the

57:26.722 --> 57:30.136
latest one. And so the investment in domestic

57:30.168 --> 57:33.772
violence is significant. But when we're talking about active shooter and making

57:33.826 --> 57:37.676
sure your division is ready because I have to have conversations with my father

57:37.708 --> 57:40.764
about going to grocery stores right, and transitioning

57:40.812 --> 57:44.256
that because of what could possibly be. We're a huge city and

57:44.278 --> 57:47.836
I don't see that in terms of your division around active

57:47.868 --> 57:51.396
shooter and that training. But do you need additional resources for your

57:51.418 --> 57:54.900
men and women in order to always use additional resources?

57:55.400 --> 57:58.936
Sure. Active shooting, anything else? But Councilwoman, you bring up

57:58.958 --> 58:02.248
a valid point. We do need the world that

58:02.254 --> 58:05.800
we're living in today. We all need to be ready for

58:05.870 --> 58:09.096
whatever comes. And an active shooting is a problem,

58:09.278 --> 58:12.184
and I hope I'm wrong,

58:12.302 --> 58:15.576
but I think it's going to get worse before it gets better. And we

58:15.598 --> 58:19.496
all have to look out for one another to the public. Be aware

58:19.528 --> 58:22.796
of your surroundings. I want us to keep going where we're going and take care

58:22.818 --> 58:25.532
of one another, but be aware of your surroundings.

58:25.676 --> 58:29.404
We'll continue with our active shooting training that Steven

58:29.452 --> 58:32.812
Daniels does and some other individuals,

58:32.876 --> 58:36.764
and we need to increase that because you have to be in a mindset

58:36.812 --> 58:39.510
and if you don't think about it before it happens,

58:40.120 --> 58:43.424
you're going to freeze. So we got to get in the mindset

58:43.472 --> 58:46.976
and we have to train our officers to respond quickly and effectively.

58:47.088 --> 58:49.930
But also citizens need to know what to do.

58:50.620 --> 58:53.704
The first few seconds of

58:53.742 --> 58:56.584
an active shooter, the first few minutes,

58:56.782 --> 59:00.984
if you can survive that, if you can do the right thing and

59:01.022 --> 59:03.928
wait for the police arrive, once we arrive,

59:04.104 --> 59:07.484
we handle it pretty quickly. So we all need to, as a community,

59:07.602 --> 59:10.350
be aware of it and train up.

59:12.720 --> 59:16.496
Vice mayor pro TEM martha kestex tatum. Thank you,

59:16.518 --> 59:20.384
chair. I really wanted to just amplify some of

59:20.422 --> 59:24.416
the performance measures that

59:24.518 --> 59:28.260
you have in your book and the

59:28.330 --> 59:32.260
external citizen complaints with the

59:32.330 --> 59:35.808
expected performance measures of a reduction

59:35.904 --> 59:39.172
of 2%. I like the

59:39.226 --> 59:43.292
trend in that specific category,

59:43.456 --> 59:47.288
especially because now we have more ways for people to report

59:47.454 --> 59:51.840
their complaints. And the fact that we have opened

59:51.860 --> 59:55.916
that up with the addition of Ms. Okafor's office

59:56.098 --> 59:59.180
and the other opportunities that people have to

59:59.250 --> 1:00:03.048
actually express their concerns and that we're trending downward,

1:00:03.144 --> 1:00:06.560
I think it speaks volumes for our city and for

1:00:06.630 --> 1:00:11.484
our police department. And then on the accomplishments

1:00:11.612 --> 1:00:15.488
that we completed, 78 of 104

1:00:15.654 --> 1:00:19.712
of the mayor's task Force on Policing Reform recommendations.

1:00:19.856 --> 1:00:23.636
I don't think we tout that enough. When that was happening,

1:00:23.818 --> 1:00:27.444
we had residents in the city of Houston asking for

1:00:27.482 --> 1:00:30.968
these items and we completed 78 of

1:00:31.054 --> 1:00:34.664
104 of those recommendations. And as

1:00:34.702 --> 1:00:38.404
a city and a police department, I think this speaks

1:00:38.452 --> 1:00:42.072
volumes for our residents to know that we hear them

1:00:42.206 --> 1:00:45.756
and we want to make sure that we are serving them to the best of

1:00:45.778 --> 1:00:49.436
our capabilities. And so I wanted to say thank you to all of

1:00:49.458 --> 1:00:52.648
our HPD officers and everyone that served on that task

1:00:52.664 --> 1:00:56.256
force, to the council members and to the entire city of

1:00:56.278 --> 1:00:59.872
Houston, because public safety is one of the most important things

1:00:59.926 --> 1:01:03.456
that will take place in our city. And I think we are

1:01:03.558 --> 1:01:07.296
leading the nation, hence your visit to the

1:01:07.318 --> 1:01:10.724
White House and setting a real standard as we

1:01:10.762 --> 1:01:14.084
deal with tough issues in this country. Thank you so much

1:01:14.122 --> 1:01:17.668
for bringing that up. That was in the talking points and I was trying to

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:21.096
save time, but I'm so proud of that and we are

1:01:21.118 --> 1:01:24.328
all proud of that. I want to say this too,

1:01:24.414 --> 1:01:27.656
right quick, if I can. When I was up

1:01:27.678 --> 1:01:31.268
in DC. President Biden's

1:01:31.284 --> 1:01:34.684
administration. Several members spoke of our one

1:01:34.722 --> 1:01:38.236
Safe Houston plan. They said that it was one of the best that they

1:01:38.258 --> 1:01:41.980
have seen because we're actually bringing people together and fighting crime,

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:46.156
violence, disruption programs, dealing with mental

1:01:46.188 --> 1:01:49.724
illness, more funding for that, working with domestic violence.

1:01:49.772 --> 1:01:52.864
But they were very excited about the way that we

1:01:52.902 --> 1:01:56.050
are bringing people together, building trust,

1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:00.784
working on issues that are symptoms

1:02:00.912 --> 1:02:04.772
of violent crime. I'm really proud and

1:02:04.826 --> 1:02:08.500
excited about it. And it's not a police thing, it's a community thing.

1:02:08.650 --> 1:02:12.188
And that's huge here. And it starts with council,

1:02:12.224 --> 1:02:15.976
it starts with our great mayor. And I

1:02:15.998 --> 1:02:19.256
was very proud and I am proud about it. Thanks for allowing me to

1:02:19.278 --> 1:02:22.772
say that. Thank you, Chief. And we have a number of public speakers

1:02:22.836 --> 1:02:25.852
that are going to come before us in a minute. But before we

1:02:25.986 --> 1:02:27.900
let you go back to the streets,

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:33.704
I applaud your decision. I'm not sure if who made it on the administrative

1:02:33.752 --> 1:02:37.240
team, but to go from six cadet classes to five, but to

1:02:37.250 --> 1:02:40.544
staff them with more individuals, to get them on the streets more

1:02:40.582 --> 1:02:44.210
rapidly, I think that was a brilliant move and I'm glad to support it.

1:02:44.580 --> 1:02:47.984
In the day of defunding police, I'm proud to say that

1:02:48.022 --> 1:02:51.556
we add money to your budget, but we can reallocate the amount of money in

1:02:51.578 --> 1:02:55.184
there to certain departments, like you mentioned, with the mental health component.

1:02:55.312 --> 1:02:58.832
So a lot of those things that we're doing today are very creative

1:02:58.896 --> 1:03:01.992
and I applaud you and your staff for doing those types of things.

1:03:02.126 --> 1:03:05.956
The one thing that always bothers me, and this is my 9th

1:03:06.068 --> 1:03:09.512
Police Department budget process, I always ask

1:03:09.566 --> 1:03:13.450
this question, how many of your police officers are

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:17.816
retirement eligible today? Percentage wise?

1:03:17.928 --> 1:03:20.684
Just a guess. About 27%?

1:03:20.802 --> 1:03:24.716
27%. I look behind you and I see some great individuals and

1:03:24.738 --> 1:03:28.128
I walk the streets every day. And you all

1:03:28.134 --> 1:03:31.952
do a phenomenal job. I know I couldn't do it, so God

1:03:32.006 --> 1:03:35.468
bless. Thank you for what you do. Stay safe.

1:03:35.644 --> 1:03:39.072
And as I always say, whenever I say I'm the last guy,

1:03:39.126 --> 1:03:42.276
it comes back to somebody else. So council member Robert Guy egos. I'll give you

1:03:42.298 --> 1:03:45.476
the last word. Thank you, Mayor Protein. Thank you,

1:03:45.498 --> 1:03:49.360
Chief, for the presentation. In regards to the budget,

1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:53.208
in regards to recruiting, does HPD reach out to

1:03:53.214 --> 1:03:57.032
the High School of Law Enforcement working some kind of

1:03:57.166 --> 1:04:00.740
I know, like you stated, that right now you're required some college degree

1:04:00.820 --> 1:04:04.344
or some college credits. Yes, and what have you.

1:04:04.542 --> 1:04:08.204
So are you all partnering with the High School of Law Enforcement? Not only that

1:04:08.242 --> 1:04:12.136
high school, other high schools. With our youth programs. I forgot

1:04:12.168 --> 1:04:15.408
to mention that I'm glad you brought up youth programs and

1:04:15.494 --> 1:04:19.612
I'm stepping outside, but it's very important youth

1:04:19.676 --> 1:04:23.516
and going into this summer, please, whatever we do with Parks

1:04:23.548 --> 1:04:27.852
and Rec, get those pools open, hire more lifeguards

1:04:27.916 --> 1:04:31.364
and get some basketball goes up. So we have to do that.

1:04:31.402 --> 1:04:34.820
To answer your question, absolutely. And that's a part of our

1:04:34.890 --> 1:04:38.724
recruiting. With our Explorer program, we start working with those young

1:04:38.762 --> 1:04:41.912
men and young women at a young age,

1:04:42.046 --> 1:04:45.912
as early as the 9th grade, getting them acclimated and

1:04:45.966 --> 1:04:48.650
hoping that they join our agency later.

1:04:49.020 --> 1:04:52.460
Well, that's good to know. And I appreciate

1:04:53.600 --> 1:04:57.900
also you mentioning regarding keeping

1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:03.676
or us being aware of what's out there in regards to I

1:05:03.698 --> 1:05:07.056
know what happened this past weekend in Buffalo and what happened in El

1:05:07.078 --> 1:05:09.410
Paso a couple of years ago.

1:05:10.820 --> 1:05:13.756
I know that we received calls from constituents.

1:05:13.788 --> 1:05:18.124
A couple of weeks ago, there was a neo Nazi group that was putting baggies

1:05:18.172 --> 1:05:21.884
out in people's driveways promoting

1:05:21.932 --> 1:05:25.652
neo Nazism. And of course, we asked them to call

1:05:25.706 --> 1:05:28.964
HPD. So I don't know if that's are you

1:05:29.002 --> 1:05:32.120
getting other calls throughout the city as well?

1:05:32.270 --> 1:05:35.576
We take those hate crimes and crimes of

1:05:35.598 --> 1:05:39.540
bias really seriously. I hadn't seen the uptick,

1:05:39.700 --> 1:05:43.448
but I'll get you some stats just to make sure. But it's

1:05:43.464 --> 1:05:46.844
a call to our entire community to look after one another, and we really need

1:05:46.882 --> 1:05:50.444
to stamp out that hate at the

1:05:50.562 --> 1:05:53.768
earliest moment. We can just stop it

1:05:53.794 --> 1:05:57.440
and stamp it out. And there's some responsibility to close

1:05:57.510 --> 1:06:00.608
friends and family members as well. When you see it,

1:06:00.774 --> 1:06:02.610
get your loved ones some help.

1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:07.488
Great. Thank you. Once again,

1:06:07.574 --> 1:06:11.124
thank you for what you do each and every day. Thank you

1:06:11.162 --> 1:06:14.564
to my friends in HPOU and as I heard two weeks

1:06:14.602 --> 1:06:17.924
ago, officers dismissed. We'll now go to

1:06:17.962 --> 1:06:21.492
public speakers. Mayor Pro. Tim, before we leave,

1:06:21.546 --> 1:06:24.968
I wanted to just reiterate that for the gun buyback program,

1:06:25.054 --> 1:06:28.520
it's actually starting July 30, so I think that one was

1:06:28.590 --> 1:06:31.912
just determined this morning. So I wanted to. Okay, so it doesn't start

1:06:31.966 --> 1:06:35.500
until July. July. July. Got it. Thanks.

1:06:35.650 --> 1:06:39.852
God bless. First public

1:06:39.906 --> 1:06:43.180
speaker is Fabiola Jimenez.

1:06:49.360 --> 1:06:53.260
Fabiola Jimenez. Going once, going twice.

1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:55.180
Mr. Jason. Oliver.

1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:01.856
Thank have handouts

1:07:01.888 --> 1:07:02.470
today.

1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:22.476
Sorry, I wasn't trying to put you to work, Councilmember Jackson. I wasn't expecting

1:07:22.508 --> 1:07:24.800
everybody to run out during public comment.

1:07:26.580 --> 1:07:30.416
And we're going to hold everybody to 1 minute, as instructions stated,

1:07:30.448 --> 1:07:33.268
because we have a meeting that starts in just a little while and we have

1:07:33.274 --> 1:07:36.564
to transition. All right, I'll go quick. So this

1:07:36.602 --> 1:07:40.288
handout shows items that are consistently higher in general fund spending

1:07:40.304 --> 1:07:43.924
than actuals and therefore good candidates free allocation to a department

1:07:43.972 --> 1:07:47.592
like housing. I know council member Catholic Tatum is gone, but she mentioned

1:07:47.646 --> 1:07:51.064
the complaint process. If you go on HPD's website right now,

1:07:51.182 --> 1:07:54.552
please tell me if you see an easier process for filing a complaint.

1:07:54.616 --> 1:07:58.412
It hasn't changed on their website. It still asks for your Social Security number

1:07:58.466 --> 1:08:02.204
in a city like Houston. According to HPD stats and public

1:08:02.242 --> 1:08:05.696
safety presentations, violent crime and crime overall was down year

1:08:05.718 --> 1:08:09.424
to date before one Safe Houston was announced. I'm concerned that the public is being

1:08:09.462 --> 1:08:12.096
misled about things like that. Also,

1:08:12.198 --> 1:08:15.904
according to the Texas Sandra Bland Act racial profiling data

1:08:15.942 --> 1:08:19.136
for 2021, HPD is a state leader in violent

1:08:19.168 --> 1:08:22.896
traffic stops. We have only 3% of stops

1:08:22.928 --> 1:08:26.528
in Texas, but 44% of violent stops statewide.

1:08:26.624 --> 1:08:30.136
That averages out to five violent stops per day, with three of them

1:08:30.158 --> 1:08:33.796
targeting black people each day. With these terrible statistics

1:08:33.828 --> 1:08:37.716
and the clear danger posed both to officers and residents

1:08:37.828 --> 1:08:41.192
by these hundreds of thousands of stops, how much are we paying

1:08:41.246 --> 1:08:43.948
for this traffic enforcement? Thank you.

1:08:44.034 --> 1:08:47.452
And I'm assuming this is referring to what I would call a

1:08:47.506 --> 1:08:51.180
sort of a surplus. Look ahead. Exactly. Okay. Every year,

1:08:51.250 --> 1:08:54.536
you'll notice within the Mo for monthly

1:08:54.568 --> 1:08:58.144
financial reports, when we get to the end of the year, we have a

1:08:58.182 --> 1:09:02.156
large differential between what we gave departments and what they've

1:09:02.188 --> 1:09:06.144
actually spent. All that money rolls into our fund balance. That's why we

1:09:06.182 --> 1:09:09.600
maintain a healthy fund balance. This year, it's projected to be 13

1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:13.364
five based on exactly this information that you gave us.

1:09:13.402 --> 1:09:16.896
So when the departments don't spend the money that's

1:09:16.928 --> 1:09:21.976
been allocated by council, it rolls into fund balance, and we're at 13.5%,

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:25.512
and the obligated fund balance is 7.5%.

1:09:25.566 --> 1:09:28.868
So we're doubling that for the rainy day. But we want departments

1:09:28.884 --> 1:09:31.944
to spend that money. Right. So if we reallocate these

1:09:31.982 --> 1:09:35.496
overages, right? Correct. We get hundreds of thousands, but millions

1:09:35.528 --> 1:09:39.484
of dollars. Right. Then we get to use those monies for buyback programs or

1:09:39.522 --> 1:09:42.988
forensic we heard the problem with forensic science lab. Maybe we use some

1:09:42.994 --> 1:09:46.832
of that for parks or

1:09:46.886 --> 1:09:50.416
parks, whatever. You're exactly right. Right. So I just want to say

1:09:50.438 --> 1:09:53.872
that these are clear candidates for hundreds of thousands of dollars

1:09:53.926 --> 1:09:58.036
of potential reallocation from years of consistent over budgeting for

1:09:58.058 --> 1:10:01.876
these items. Council. Member Alcorn, some of the drainage improvements that

1:10:01.898 --> 1:10:05.830
we talked about in District B. Absolutely. District e.

1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:11.236
Stop. A blanding. Thank you. Question comes

1:10:11.258 --> 1:10:14.488
from a robin. Sorry, I'm back in. Okay. I just wanted to point out,

1:10:14.574 --> 1:10:18.356
I did ask I did notice that $1.4 million increase in temporary personnel

1:10:18.388 --> 1:10:22.264
services, that is for hiring the retired officers. So that

1:10:22.302 --> 1:10:26.188
looks like your biggest item on there. I think these are adjustments from

1:10:26.354 --> 1:10:29.724
where we end up and where we're budgeting next year, correct? Yes,

1:10:29.762 --> 1:10:33.656
sir. Ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Oliver saba

1:10:33.688 --> 1:10:36.460
blandy did bring your daughter today.

1:10:36.610 --> 1:10:39.792
Listener I know she had tar testing. How many people

1:10:39.846 --> 1:10:43.308
with a documented history of mental health challenges did HPD arrest

1:10:43.324 --> 1:10:46.812
in 2000 and 22,021? How many calls received by emergency

1:10:46.876 --> 1:10:50.508
dispatch regarding a mental health crisis were responded to with armed police officers

1:10:50.524 --> 1:10:54.356
in 2000 and 22,021? How many of those were part of a Cert team?

1:10:54.458 --> 1:10:57.728
How many of those were individual officers without the support of a trained mental

1:10:57.744 --> 1:11:01.056
health professional? How many calls received by emergency dispatch

1:11:01.088 --> 1:11:04.788
regarding a mental health crises were responded to with an unarmed

1:11:04.884 --> 1:11:08.104
response through MCOT in 2000 and 22,021? I heard

1:11:08.142 --> 1:11:11.748
it would only cost 23 million to expand Heart Holistic Assistance Response

1:11:11.764 --> 1:11:15.176
Team to cover all of Harris County. Harris county currently has invested

1:11:15.208 --> 1:11:19.016
1.2 million for a pilot program. How would it relieve HPD officers

1:11:19.048 --> 1:11:22.540
to have such a program expanded into Houston? Would the city of Houston consider

1:11:22.610 --> 1:11:26.328
expanding the Heart pilot into Houston? To quote precinct to

1:11:26.354 --> 1:11:30.256
Commissioner Adrian Garcia, heart is a historic investment in

1:11:30.278 --> 1:11:33.648
public safety, and I'm excited to see this cutting edge program be launched soon.

1:11:33.734 --> 1:11:37.484
As a longtime member of law enforcement who has seen firsthand what's

1:11:37.532 --> 1:11:40.836
happening in some communities, I know that having the right people respond to

1:11:40.858 --> 1:11:44.180
a scene can make all the difference between a positive or tragic outcome. Okay,

1:11:44.250 --> 1:11:47.540
thank you for your comments. What I would do is I would send that exact

1:11:47.610 --> 1:11:51.256
list and give it to your council member, and let's make sure that we

1:11:51.278 --> 1:11:54.836
have that answered, and we'll post that on SharePoint for every council member.

1:11:54.948 --> 1:11:58.932
So thank you for your interest. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

1:11:58.996 --> 1:12:02.472
Thank you, Chair. And thank you to the public speakers. I think this is hard.

1:12:02.526 --> 1:12:05.868
You've sat through a long meeting, and you're really trying to spit it all out.

1:12:05.954 --> 1:12:08.956
I will have a form up on my website, hopefully by the end of the

1:12:08.978 --> 1:12:12.780
day. I send it out via email where you can submit questions

1:12:12.930 --> 1:12:16.352
easily. We want to make sure we track all that too fast to write down.

1:12:16.406 --> 1:12:20.252
But thank you very much for your participation, and we do respect

1:12:20.316 --> 1:12:23.856
the fact that you have questions that you want answered. Thank you.

1:12:23.958 --> 1:12:28.176
And thank you for that notice. And also have council

1:12:28.208 --> 1:12:32.288
members questions that were asked during this session and other sessions posted

1:12:32.304 --> 1:12:35.716
to SharePoint as well. And we'll make sure that we get those included for the

1:12:35.738 --> 1:12:40.020
public mr. Christopher Rivera.

1:12:54.950 --> 1:12:58.510
Hello, Nick. I'm glad

1:12:58.670 --> 1:13:02.478
some council members mentioned the performance measures measurements.

1:13:02.574 --> 1:13:06.706
My question is, why should the police department receive an additional $32 million when

1:13:06.728 --> 1:13:10.254
they continue to fail and in some instances barely meet the department's

1:13:10.302 --> 1:13:14.146
2022 performance measurement goals? For example, the police

1:13:14.178 --> 1:13:17.346
set a response time goal of 75%. The police estimate

1:13:17.378 --> 1:13:21.654
they will only reach that goal by 55% this year,

1:13:21.852 --> 1:13:25.078
failing to meet that goal by 20% next year, the police

1:13:25.094 --> 1:13:29.206
will be lowering that goal to 65% to accommodate the police slow response.

1:13:29.318 --> 1:13:32.662
Here's an instance when police barely reached their goal. The police department

1:13:32.726 --> 1:13:36.286
priority was to have an average response time of four to six minutes.

1:13:36.388 --> 1:13:40.410
The police estimate that the average response time is five minutes and 54 seconds.

1:13:40.490 --> 1:13:44.126
The previous year's response time was slightly faster. Why should

1:13:44.148 --> 1:13:47.474
we continue invest in systems that fail us when there is so much need for

1:13:47.512 --> 1:13:51.234
housing, parks and services that benefit the community and

1:13:51.272 --> 1:13:54.610
doesn't criminalize us? I would like a response.

1:13:55.930 --> 1:13:59.606
Thank you, Mr. Rivera. No response. There are

1:13:59.628 --> 1:14:01.190
no council members in queue.

1:14:02.330 --> 1:14:03.750
Lauren Johnson,

1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:11.630
am I closing us out today?

1:14:12.500 --> 1:14:15.330
So just to be fair,

1:14:15.700 --> 1:14:19.328
I heard you saying that we should submit our questions to the

1:14:19.334 --> 1:14:23.536
council, and we'll do that, but also we

1:14:23.558 --> 1:14:26.784
couldn't have done that before because the presentations hadn't been made.

1:14:26.822 --> 1:14:30.052
I know the slides were available, but also the process has been different

1:14:30.106 --> 1:14:32.310
in previous days, so that wasn't possible.

1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.860
I was interested in hearing about the site and release program.

1:14:35.930 --> 1:14:39.556
I'd like to know a little more about how many times that has been

1:14:39.578 --> 1:14:41.080
used in 2000 and 22,021,

1:14:41.150 --> 1:14:44.756
and also if there are plans

1:14:44.788 --> 1:14:48.772
to expand it and find out where the problems exist

1:14:48.836 --> 1:14:52.184
in that program. Because I think it should be

1:14:52.222 --> 1:14:55.592
being used more and we haven't been seeing it live up to its full potential.

1:14:55.656 --> 1:14:59.116
So I think it's important to identify what's going on with that and how

1:14:59.138 --> 1:15:02.364
we can improve that program. That's it.

1:15:02.482 --> 1:15:06.300
Thank you, Ms. Johnson. Thanks, Mr Peter Stout.

1:15:13.250 --> 1:15:16.900
Good afternoon, you all. Dr. Peter Stout, head nerd of the crime lab.

1:15:17.990 --> 1:15:21.458
I mostly showed up just to answer any questions. I figured

1:15:21.474 --> 1:15:25.814
there probably would be some questions with HPD as we

1:15:25.852 --> 1:15:30.040
are inextricably linked to what HPD does. They depend on

1:15:30.410 --> 1:15:34.102
our results for their investigative investigations.

1:15:34.246 --> 1:15:37.130
The courts depend on our results for prosecutions.

1:15:38.190 --> 1:15:42.074
And if there are questions I can answer for you now about where

1:15:42.112 --> 1:15:45.374
we're at, I know there was one question, I forget who asked

1:15:45.412 --> 1:15:50.014
it, about pages 456 and 457

1:15:50.132 --> 1:15:53.642
are fund 20 213. That was the transitionary

1:15:53.706 --> 1:15:57.134
fund for the LGC when we started as the LGC. So right now

1:15:57.172 --> 1:16:00.686
it's got three employees left in it. That's why

1:16:00.708 --> 1:16:04.014
that is only about 300,000. If you look for the rest of what our budget

1:16:04.062 --> 1:16:07.986
is, is on page 233. There's one note in there of the 28

1:16:08.008 --> 1:16:11.986
and a half million, and that is really the discussion of the difference between that

1:16:12.008 --> 1:16:15.526
and what my board passed and the differences of what

1:16:15.548 --> 1:16:18.086
that will mean for us, of what we can do in the coming couple of

1:16:18.108 --> 1:16:21.670
years. But if there are questions, I'm happy. Yes. Council member. Leticia plummer.

1:16:22.090 --> 1:16:24.806
Thank you so much. And thank you, Dr. Staff, for everything that you do with

1:16:24.828 --> 1:16:28.282
your whole entire team. Can you explain a little bit? I know there's a

1:16:28.416 --> 1:16:32.266
tell me exactly how much you're looking to need

1:16:32.288 --> 1:16:35.626
in terms of increase of your budget and then just a very quick synopsis of

1:16:35.648 --> 1:16:39.406
what those those are going to be used for. Certainly what my board passed was

1:16:39.508 --> 1:16:41.440
34.4 million.

1:16:42.850 --> 1:16:47.054
That includes 2.6 million for wage adjustments.

1:16:47.102 --> 1:16:50.450
We are getting our heads handed to us in retention and recruiting.

1:16:51.030 --> 1:16:54.606
There's about a million in there to expand the crime scene

1:16:54.638 --> 1:16:58.498
unit. There is about

1:16:58.664 --> 1:17:02.326
500,000 in there. And we basically walk down the

1:17:02.348 --> 1:17:07.062
places that we are the most concerned. Crime scene firearms next.

1:17:07.116 --> 1:17:10.466
After that is toxicology Layton prints.

1:17:10.578 --> 1:17:14.766
And the balance of that, this is about a $5.9 million

1:17:14.818 --> 1:17:18.026
difference from this year's budget into next year.

1:17:18.128 --> 1:17:21.446
So it's between staffing and then trying to stabilize

1:17:21.478 --> 1:17:23.340
the growth of the backlogs that we're seeing.

1:17:25.870 --> 1:17:29.198
Another question, and if you receive that money, do you believe that

1:17:29.204 --> 1:17:33.066
we could decrease the backlog that we have currently? I don't

1:17:33.098 --> 1:17:36.720
think so. Okay. And this is part of the concern that I have.

1:17:37.250 --> 1:17:40.970
We have had backlogs grow somewhere between twice

1:17:41.050 --> 1:17:44.926
to about five fold, depending on which discipline you're looking at. The difficulty

1:17:44.958 --> 1:17:48.402
for us is we are disproportionately affected by homicide in particular,

1:17:48.536 --> 1:17:52.134
creates a lot of evidence. The evidence that it creates goes to our most

1:17:52.172 --> 1:17:55.906
expensive disciplines. So it's really disproportionate in the impact

1:17:55.938 --> 1:17:57.510
that it has on the laboratory.

1:17:59.210 --> 1:18:03.930
It is very long arc for us, training examiners

1:18:04.990 --> 1:18:08.378
finding equipment. So really, if I were to try

1:18:08.384 --> 1:18:11.926
and eliminate the backlog, that would probably take something more in the neighborhood

1:18:11.958 --> 1:18:15.494
of 45 million. Even if that number were realistic,

1:18:15.542 --> 1:18:19.278
I couldn't spend it. I can't find the people, I can't find the equipment in

1:18:19.284 --> 1:18:23.246
this next year. So the 34 is designed to work with

1:18:23.268 --> 1:18:27.070
what we've got and try and stabilize the growth of the backlogs.

1:18:28.930 --> 1:18:31.474
We have 200 amazing people.

1:18:31.672 --> 1:18:35.182
I have full confidence they will probably exceed expectations.

1:18:35.326 --> 1:18:38.962
But so that you have an understanding of the expectations of what that's designed for,

1:18:39.016 --> 1:18:42.340
it is to stabilize backlogs, not reduce anything.

1:18:44.230 --> 1:18:46.760
Council member Abbey Cayman. Thank you,

1:18:47.450 --> 1:18:52.158
Dr Stout. Just so we're clear, when we talk about evidence backlogs,

1:18:52.194 --> 1:18:54.854
that's distinct from the current court backlog.

1:18:54.902 --> 1:18:58.570
Correct. Do you want to expand upon that a little bit? Oh, boy.

1:18:58.640 --> 1:19:02.662
Yeah. So a crime laboratory gets to be sandwiched

1:19:02.726 --> 1:19:06.654
between law enforcement doing investigations and

1:19:06.692 --> 1:19:10.314
we do evidence processing as part of investigations.

1:19:10.362 --> 1:19:14.234
And as law enforcement builds a case, then law enforcement

1:19:14.282 --> 1:19:18.850
hands that case over to prosecutors to develop

1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:22.206
the case for prosecution. At that point, there is a whole nother

1:19:22.238 --> 1:19:25.570
suite of requests we often get that come from prosecution.

1:19:25.990 --> 1:19:30.206
So for us, we've got the increase in particularly

1:19:30.238 --> 1:19:34.118
homicide over the last couple of years that sandwiched us from that side

1:19:34.284 --> 1:19:37.618
now with the absolutely mind boggling backlog

1:19:37.634 --> 1:19:41.794
in the courts as that is picking back up the pressure

1:19:41.842 --> 1:19:45.034
from that to support past results that we've done in

1:19:45.072 --> 1:19:49.018
court goes up. And the request from prosecutors who are now starting to

1:19:49.104 --> 1:19:52.954
deal with cases goes up. So right now my folks are testifying on

1:19:52.992 --> 1:19:57.434
violent crime cases typically from about 2017, 2018 as

1:19:57.472 --> 1:20:00.702
the courts catch up to where we're at. This is part of my concern is

1:20:00.756 --> 1:20:04.570
somewhere in about the next six to twelve months we start to become the backlog

1:20:04.650 --> 1:20:08.574
and the bottleneck because the courts are then going to start waiting on us for

1:20:08.612 --> 1:20:12.786
results on cases when they get there. Right now we're not just

1:20:12.808 --> 1:20:16.526
to be clear as it stands today, and I appreciate it always helps

1:20:16.558 --> 1:20:19.938
right when we have people saying, hey, in about six months or a year we're

1:20:19.954 --> 1:20:22.422
going to have a challenge and we need to be looking at that now.

1:20:22.476 --> 1:20:26.120
So I appreciate that very much. And right now

1:20:27.050 --> 1:20:31.646
the court backlog is not hinging

1:20:31.698 --> 1:20:35.114
on the incredible work that the Forensic Science Center is

1:20:35.152 --> 1:20:38.380
doing. The DA's office is not hinged on

1:20:40.110 --> 1:20:43.146
that either. No, that's not where at right now.

1:20:43.328 --> 1:20:46.742
You can see the arc of this. I joke

1:20:46.806 --> 1:20:50.206
explaining our work is a little bit more like explaining orbital dynamics than it

1:20:50.228 --> 1:20:53.786
is like driving a car. Because what we do now for us impacts

1:20:53.818 --> 1:20:57.726
where we're at in about two years. And my concern is even if

1:20:57.748 --> 1:21:00.866
you back the truckload of money over on me in two years,

1:21:01.048 --> 1:21:04.414
I can't do much with it for another two years. Understood,

1:21:04.462 --> 1:21:07.140
but I really appreciate the clarification. Thank you.

1:21:07.590 --> 1:21:11.554
So a follow up. So your backlog is related

1:21:11.602 --> 1:21:15.800
to people and equipment. Correct. Okay. So you have a homicide today

1:21:16.490 --> 1:21:20.040
looking at a presentation that you had given ways back.

1:21:20.730 --> 1:21:24.026
We won't get to the evidence because of the backlog that we

1:21:24.048 --> 1:21:27.354
have for three years. And if

1:21:27.392 --> 1:21:31.238
that employee who's doing the evidence collection and the data leaves,

1:21:31.334 --> 1:21:35.082
the clock starts over again. So that employee goes back to day

1:21:35.136 --> 1:21:37.654
one and that three years was wasted.

1:21:37.782 --> 1:21:41.614
Yeah. This is a consistent problem for us and really for every

1:21:41.652 --> 1:21:44.910
laboratory in the state as we have employees that leave and

1:21:44.980 --> 1:21:48.622
this is part of the cost to me for employees, we figure.

1:21:48.756 --> 1:21:53.006
And I was just at the meeting of American Society Crime Laboratory directors

1:21:53.118 --> 1:21:56.914
a couple of weeks ago. Most labs, it's somewhere between 300,000

1:21:56.952 --> 1:22:00.770
and $500,000 to train a new analyst just

1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:04.134
out of the box, somewhere between about a year to three years before

1:22:04.172 --> 1:22:08.566
they're productive in the laboratory. If they leave in

1:22:08.588 --> 1:22:11.942
the court, unless we can get that person to come back

1:22:11.996 --> 1:22:15.802
and testify about that, the evidence becomes hearsay. So most

1:22:15.936 --> 1:22:19.190
prosecutors will want and pressure us to rework

1:22:19.270 --> 1:22:23.306
the case with somebody that's actually currently employed. So you can almost take when

1:22:23.328 --> 1:22:26.414
an employee leaves, you can take the work that they've done for about the last

1:22:26.452 --> 1:22:29.360
three to five years and throw it out the way backlog. Absolutely.

1:22:29.810 --> 1:22:33.102
So what's the solution? We have to stay

1:22:33.156 --> 1:22:36.462
ahead of the curve. And this is why,

1:22:36.596 --> 1:22:39.954
to Council Member Cayman's point right now, we're not the

1:22:39.992 --> 1:22:44.082
problem. I am desperately trying to not be the problem about

1:22:44.136 --> 1:22:48.206
two years from now, because we have to try and stay ahead of the arc

1:22:48.238 --> 1:22:51.782
of this, knowing all of these challenges that we have to get equipment in

1:22:51.836 --> 1:22:55.782
to validate things to train employees so

1:22:55.836 --> 1:22:59.430
that two years from now, we aren't the headline.

1:22:59.930 --> 1:23:03.414
So I would invite Chair Cayman to

1:23:03.452 --> 1:23:07.046
bring this up in one of your public safety. Because when I started reviewing

1:23:07.078 --> 1:23:10.554
the material for today's presentation, I went back and looked at

1:23:10.752 --> 1:23:13.866
the position that if somebody leaves, then you start the clock all

1:23:13.888 --> 1:23:17.286
over again, and you just wasted three years. And that person sits in jail for

1:23:17.328 --> 1:23:21.066
six years instead of three until the trial comes. So I'd

1:23:21.098 --> 1:23:24.160
love to dig into this a little bit more when we have more time.

1:23:24.690 --> 1:23:28.606
Those conversations and the planning for that we're speaking,

1:23:28.788 --> 1:23:32.002
those are conversations that we're currently having right now. Okay, great.

1:23:32.056 --> 1:23:35.218
Thank you. No other council members in queue. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you

1:23:35.224 --> 1:23:39.620
very much. I appreciate your support. Yes. Thanks, Dr. Sal. Appreciate what you do.

1:23:40.490 --> 1:23:44.098
Joe Grochell followed

1:23:44.114 --> 1:23:46.630
by Melissa Martinez and Aris Brown.

1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:56.060
So we are spending $8 million on community affairs.

1:23:56.220 --> 1:24:00.624
This seems like a very expensive duplication of city services,

1:24:00.822 --> 1:24:04.064
especially neighborhoods, which could be

1:24:04.102 --> 1:24:07.750
beneficial for all the other departments we've been hearing from.

1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:12.500
Would council members consider and support consolidation?

1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:20.204
And then my other question is in

1:24:20.242 --> 1:24:23.696
what the police said in his objectives is how

1:24:23.718 --> 1:24:25.680
do you measure reduce fear?

1:24:27.700 --> 1:24:31.232
I would like him to like you all to figure that out. How do you

1:24:31.286 --> 1:24:34.944
measure reduce fear? If you

1:24:34.982 --> 1:24:38.164
write those questions I'm sure you have in your notes, submit it to your

1:24:38.202 --> 1:24:41.844
council member. We will enter that and we will get the answers within 48 hours.

1:24:41.962 --> 1:24:46.020
Thank you, and thanks again for coming. You're welcome. Melissa Martinez.

1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.356
Hi. I have a couple

1:24:59.378 --> 1:25:02.924
of questions, such as how many unhoused students and how

1:25:02.962 --> 1:25:06.412
many the in house and students have been

1:25:06.546 --> 1:25:09.904
arrested by HPD in 2000 and 22,021?

1:25:10.102 --> 1:25:13.964
Because I know that a lot of council members have previously discussed

1:25:14.012 --> 1:25:17.696
about all these cases of domestic abuse

1:25:17.728 --> 1:25:21.700
and all these other abusive, very violent

1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:25.796
situations. And I wanted to follow up with another question,

1:25:25.898 --> 1:25:29.690
because after listening to other departments that were brought up here today

1:25:30.380 --> 1:25:33.208
on how some, even you yourself,

1:25:33.294 --> 1:25:37.320
praise how much they could do while being underfunded

1:25:37.900 --> 1:25:41.672
within their own limited, low budgets. And I wanted to ask

1:25:41.726 --> 1:25:45.404
if there could be a possibility with all these issues of

1:25:45.442 --> 1:25:48.684
being at the intersections and facing these violences that

1:25:48.722 --> 1:25:52.204
they do need to be funded, such as housing in

1:25:52.242 --> 1:25:55.680
public libraries, the public recreations.

1:25:56.100 --> 1:25:57.170
As myself,

1:26:00.580 --> 1:26:04.544
I am a survivor of domestic abuse. And those are those things yes,

1:26:04.582 --> 1:26:08.630
ma'am. That helped me. Yes, ma'am. So it comes down to

1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.592
it's an easy equation. It's revenue versus

1:26:12.656 --> 1:26:15.780
expenses. Revenue is capped.

1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:20.408
We receive revenue from basically two sources property

1:26:20.494 --> 1:26:23.912
taxes and sales taxes. Our sales tax

1:26:23.966 --> 1:26:27.112
projections look pretty good. Unfortunately, with inflation taking

1:26:27.166 --> 1:26:30.392
place, the cost of goods are going up. Thus our sales tax

1:26:30.446 --> 1:26:34.268
revenue has gone up. This will be the 8th year out of

1:26:34.274 --> 1:26:38.270
the past nine years that we've had a tax rate

1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:42.872
decrease. And the tax rate is a function well,

1:26:42.946 --> 1:26:46.208
your taxes on your homestead is a

1:26:46.214 --> 1:26:49.744
function of two variables. The tax rate that we

1:26:49.782 --> 1:26:54.124
have times your value of your home. That's the revenue

1:26:54.172 --> 1:26:57.270
we receive on the property tax.

1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:02.308
So we're capped by the state of Texas so that every year

1:27:02.474 --> 1:27:05.636
we have to reduce our tax rate, which means we

1:27:05.658 --> 1:27:09.224
don't get the ability to spend the money that

1:27:09.262 --> 1:27:13.300
is coming in via property taxes because it is capped,

1:27:13.380 --> 1:27:16.852
as is every major city in the state of Texas.

1:27:16.996 --> 1:27:20.392
However, the cap we're under is different

1:27:20.446 --> 1:27:23.884
than the cap. Dallas is under, san Antonio is

1:27:23.922 --> 1:27:28.044
under, and Austin is under because they're on a lesser cap.

1:27:28.242 --> 1:27:31.724
So when you look at property taxes, the tax rate

1:27:31.762 --> 1:27:34.976
has gone down eight of the last nine years. When you look

1:27:34.998 --> 1:27:38.796
at sales tax revenue, we've had some tough times during COVID

1:27:38.828 --> 1:27:42.080
but the projections look better. At the same time,

1:27:42.230 --> 1:27:46.948
our personnel costs are increasing. Police 4%

1:27:47.034 --> 1:27:51.396
salary increase come July 1 fire 6%

1:27:51.498 --> 1:27:55.056
salary increase come July 1 city Employees

1:27:55.088 --> 1:27:58.912
and municipal Employees 3% July

1:27:58.976 --> 1:28:03.064
1 and you saw in the information we were presented that 65%

1:28:03.102 --> 1:28:07.780
of our overall budget on the expense side is due to personnel.

1:28:07.940 --> 1:28:12.110
So when you have those equations, it's a no win situation

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:16.796
unless you go out and tell people in the city of Houston, do you

1:28:16.818 --> 1:28:18.780
want your taxes to increase?

1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:25.340
Every year I do this and I announce it to fellow council members.

1:28:25.410 --> 1:28:28.604
I look at my tax bill and I share it publicly.

1:28:28.732 --> 1:28:32.476
And in my tax bill this year that I paid in February,

1:28:32.668 --> 1:28:36.228
the amount of dollars that I gave to the city of Houston was

1:28:36.314 --> 1:28:39.270
19% of my overall tax bill.

1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:43.910
My school district taxes are 56%.

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:48.224
We had an election on Saturday for a bond referendum

1:28:48.272 --> 1:28:52.000
that passed overwhelmingly. But yet, every time

1:28:52.090 --> 1:28:55.816
I'm out in public, people look at me and say, your taxes are way

1:28:55.838 --> 1:28:59.512
too high in the city of Houston. And I point back to my school

1:28:59.566 --> 1:29:03.308
district taxes. Yeah, you get what you pay for.

1:29:03.474 --> 1:29:07.116
But I have no children anymore that are in

1:29:07.138 --> 1:29:11.052
the K through twelve education and I look really closely at the dollars

1:29:11.106 --> 1:29:14.316
that are spent in my particular school district. So I've rambled way too

1:29:14.338 --> 1:29:17.648
much. But we have a no win situation in the

1:29:17.654 --> 1:29:21.328
city of Houston because of the property tax cap that we're under

1:29:21.494 --> 1:29:25.584
and the sales tax revenue projections that we see coming at us.

1:29:25.622 --> 1:29:29.412
Because basically, we have those two sources. And if I ask Joe Q

1:29:29.466 --> 1:29:33.524
public if they want their taxes increased by the city, they'll say, not no,

1:29:33.562 --> 1:29:37.044
but heck no. Thank you. I wanted

1:29:37.082 --> 1:29:41.000
to follow up real quick because we got to get out about all these

1:29:41.070 --> 1:29:44.424
caps on the taxes. And I was asking that's why I was

1:29:44.542 --> 1:29:48.484
directing it towards HBD, having all these allocations

1:29:48.532 --> 1:29:52.136
of funds, and that way that other departments

1:29:52.168 --> 1:29:55.692
could be invested through those instead of just

1:29:55.746 --> 1:29:59.240
hiring these tax caps that you were mentioning.

1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:01.550
Yes. Thank you,

1:30:03.220 --> 1:30:06.592
Eris Brown. Last but not least

1:30:06.646 --> 1:30:07.490
for the day.

1:30:13.040 --> 1:30:17.080
Hello, city Council. I just want to say it's particularly heartbreaking

1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:20.476
to sit and a lot of people have come from their

1:30:20.498 --> 1:30:24.012
jobs and are not able to receive income

1:30:24.076 --> 1:30:27.328
because they're here, and not to be able to have their questions answered by the

1:30:27.334 --> 1:30:30.580
folks who make the presentations. And so I did want to mention

1:30:30.650 --> 1:30:34.100
that my first question is research

1:30:34.170 --> 1:30:38.064
has shown strategically and well designed parks

1:30:38.112 --> 1:30:41.936
can reduce gun violence, improve safety, and keep residents healthier

1:30:42.048 --> 1:30:45.624
with the council see a benefit in allocating some of the resources to

1:30:45.662 --> 1:30:48.996
the very clearly underfunded Parks and Recreation Department.

1:30:49.108 --> 1:30:52.916
But what would alleviate the work that needs to be done by HPD officers?

1:30:52.948 --> 1:30:55.588
We've been talking a lot about prevention,

1:30:55.764 --> 1:30:59.416
and a lot of the measures that we've thought about with HPD's presentation

1:30:59.448 --> 1:31:03.196
have been reactive. Adding more, doing this. Are we interested in

1:31:03.218 --> 1:31:07.032
more preventative measures by funding through parks and recreation

1:31:07.096 --> 1:31:10.588
libraries, et cetera? My first question, my second question

1:31:10.674 --> 1:31:14.640
is the PFM report.

1:31:14.710 --> 1:31:17.916
And Chief Finner's comments last year showed that we've had police

1:31:17.948 --> 1:31:21.388
officers doing the work that can and should be done by civilians.

1:31:21.484 --> 1:31:24.324
I wanted to know if there has been a shift in that practice at all.

1:31:24.362 --> 1:31:28.576
If you go to the website, HPD has about 5400 officers

1:31:28.608 --> 1:31:32.100
and 892 civilians. I'm interested

1:31:32.170 --> 1:31:36.010
if we've made any sort of shifts in those past couple of years.

1:31:38.300 --> 1:31:41.400
Thank you for your question. If you look at personnel,

1:31:43.980 --> 1:31:47.160
classified versus civilian,

1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:51.390
classified was 93%, civilian was 7%

1:31:53.200 --> 1:31:57.144
in the 2023 budget. And then the personnel

1:31:57.272 --> 1:32:00.832
on we'll get back with you. There's a number of different

1:32:00.886 --> 1:32:04.384
categories with that. So if you would post your question to

1:32:04.422 --> 1:32:08.240
your council member, we'll make sure that question

1:32:08.310 --> 1:32:11.936
is answered. Council Member Ed Pollard. Thank you, Mayor Pro

1:32:11.958 --> 1:32:15.872
TEM. And thank you to all the speakers who spent time coming in person

1:32:16.006 --> 1:32:19.348
to address your question. One I would like to see the study so I can

1:32:19.354 --> 1:32:21.904
see what you're reading. So if you want to send that to our offices,

1:32:21.952 --> 1:32:25.512
that would be great. I think there's always ways

1:32:25.566 --> 1:32:28.920
in which we can look at preventative measures through either different

1:32:28.990 --> 1:32:32.280
programs, after school programs, parks, libraries,

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:36.364
and it would be great if we could have some additional dollars for those

1:32:36.402 --> 1:32:39.112
programs. I think from parks,

1:32:39.176 --> 1:32:42.012
libraries, airports, police, fire,

1:32:42.066 --> 1:32:45.592
they're all going to say, we need more. There's not one department

1:32:45.656 --> 1:32:49.344
that's going to say we couldn't perform

1:32:49.462 --> 1:32:52.988
better if we had more dollars. And so from our standpoint,

1:32:53.084 --> 1:32:56.876
we have to make reasonable decisions

1:32:56.988 --> 1:33:00.544
regarding where those allocations are. Every single

1:33:00.582 --> 1:33:05.200
night you turn on the news, all you hear is issues with public safety.

1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:08.644
That is the number one email we get. That is the number one call

1:33:08.682 --> 1:33:11.956
we get. Whenever we go to

1:33:11.978 --> 1:33:15.868
homeowners associations, people are talking about crime. They're also talking about trash.

1:33:15.904 --> 1:33:19.284
They're also talking about a couple of other things, but they're always talking about crime.

1:33:19.412 --> 1:33:23.256
So we have to find ways in which to provide

1:33:23.438 --> 1:33:27.036
adequate law enforcement and public safety, but also kind of

1:33:27.058 --> 1:33:29.950
reimagine it that it's not always in the same way.

1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:33.996
So to think about police officers not

1:33:34.018 --> 1:33:37.656
always having to serve in traditional roles, I think Council Member Leticia

1:33:37.688 --> 1:33:41.360
Plummer, she brought forth an amendment last year regarding having

1:33:41.430 --> 1:33:45.104
more clinicians and technicians and medical professionals. And that's something

1:33:45.142 --> 1:33:48.604
that the mayor has put forth in his One Safe Houston

1:33:48.652 --> 1:33:52.576
plan. So we are looking at ways in which to not have the

1:33:52.598 --> 1:33:56.512
same type of traditional police officers do, the same type of traditional

1:33:56.576 --> 1:34:00.356
duties, but it's something that we need to continue to explore to see how we

1:34:00.378 --> 1:34:03.924
can make those additional steps. Right. And thanks

1:34:03.962 --> 1:34:07.476
for Ms. Brown, for your comments. As we talked about in their session,

1:34:07.668 --> 1:34:11.156
we've increased the budget projected to increase the budget in police.

1:34:11.188 --> 1:34:14.632
But the way we allocate those dollars are a lot different this year

1:34:14.686 --> 1:34:18.204
moving forward versus last year piggybacking police with

1:34:18.242 --> 1:34:21.692
mental health problems, the homeless initiative that we have a big

1:34:21.746 --> 1:34:25.484
situation with. So to Council Member Pollard's point,

1:34:25.682 --> 1:34:29.180
using the dollars a little bit differently moving forward

1:34:29.250 --> 1:34:32.672
than we do today, we don't think reimagination. I'm interested

1:34:32.726 --> 1:34:36.272
in how we can imagine these things outside of the methods that haven't worked,

1:34:36.326 --> 1:34:40.064
like the police department and actually putting them in programs that can work

1:34:40.102 --> 1:34:43.436
if we're thinking about reimagination, right? Yes, ma'am. I think that'd

1:34:43.468 --> 1:34:46.864
be a difference of opinion and perspective on what

1:34:46.902 --> 1:34:50.096
may work and what does not work. And I think those are discussions we need

1:34:50.118 --> 1:34:54.072
to continue to have. Absolutely. And I appreciate you making

1:34:54.126 --> 1:34:57.048
those comments. And if you could provide the information on that study, I'd love to

1:34:57.054 --> 1:35:00.344
read it. Absolutely. Thank you. You're welcome. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. There are no other

1:35:00.382 --> 1:35:04.472
public speaking meeting adjourned until tomorrow. We'll pick up budget meetings at

1:35:04.526 --> 1:35:07.050
01:00 with Houston Airport System.
