WEBVTT

00:08.410 --> 00:12.126
The delay, but good afternoon. I am Council Member Edward Pollard and

00:12.148 --> 00:15.850
I serve as Vice Chair of the City of Houston Budget and Fiscal Affairs Committee.

00:15.930 --> 00:19.306
I called this meeting to order and would like to welcome Council Member

00:19.338 --> 00:22.762
Abby Cayman, who is in person. All budget

00:22.826 --> 00:26.262
workshops will be conducted in person. Only public

00:26.316 --> 00:30.214
speakers have the option to comment in person or

00:30.252 --> 00:34.070
virtually. Also would like to welcome staff from District B,

00:34.220 --> 00:37.670
District F, District H, District I,

00:37.820 --> 00:42.714
at large position three, and at large position 448

00:42.752 --> 00:46.230
hours prior to the start of all workshop presentations,

00:46.310 --> 00:49.994
materials are uploaded to SharePoint and hard copies delivered to each

00:50.032 --> 00:53.386
council office. The budget workshop schedule has been posted

00:53.418 --> 00:56.586
to the BFA website. Questions from council

00:56.618 --> 01:00.510
members can be uploaded at any time during the budget workshop process,

01:00.660 --> 01:04.578
the earlier the better, allowing the departments plenty of time to provide

01:04.664 --> 01:08.546
responses. All departments have been directed to provide

01:08.648 --> 01:12.066
written responses within 48 hours of the conclusion of

01:12.088 --> 01:15.534
their presentation. To any question posted by council members

01:15.592 --> 01:19.094
to SharePoint, all public speakers should be

01:19.132 --> 01:22.806
signed in to speak. If you have not signed up,

01:22.908 --> 01:26.406
please sign in now. At the front table, district E

01:26.428 --> 01:30.540
Staff Member Carolina will be monitoring the public speakers list.

01:30.910 --> 01:34.202
Council members, the fiscal year 2023

01:34.256 --> 01:38.438
budget amendment template has also been uploaded to the SharePoint

01:38.534 --> 01:42.094
Budget Workspace. Mayor Turner sent out a memo to

01:42.132 --> 01:45.946
all council members and council offices to ensure productive discussions

01:46.058 --> 01:50.506
on the fiscal year 2023 proposed budget reminder

01:50.618 --> 01:54.206
only operational budget related amendments will be considered.

01:54.318 --> 01:57.986
Policy amendments, as in years past, will be ruled out of

01:58.008 --> 02:01.582
order. Please see the Mayor's memo for additional guidance.

02:01.726 --> 02:05.380
Amendments are due on Wednesday, May 25.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.834
We also have Council member Sally Alcorn in chambers.

02:10.962 --> 02:14.534
In person? This afternoon we will hear from

02:14.652 --> 02:17.694
Legal Department, Planning and Development Department,

02:17.842 --> 02:21.626
administrative Office of City Council, administrative and

02:21.648 --> 02:24.726
Regulatory Affairs Department, as well as the Municipal

02:24.758 --> 02:28.502
courts. As a reminder, the only people attending virtually

02:28.566 --> 02:32.462
are public speakers. We'll get to their questions after

02:32.516 --> 02:35.946
the presentations and questions from council have concluded.

02:36.058 --> 02:39.594
At this time, I would like to welcome City Attorney Arturo Michelle

02:39.642 --> 02:43.710
and Thy Ruiz to provide the legal budget presentation.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.630
The floor is yours.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.770
Um, let's begin with

02:52.840 --> 02:56.406
the second chart. This is the functional.org chart that

02:56.428 --> 03:00.642
we have. This includes the different sections,

03:00.706 --> 03:04.354
the overall and the dollars associated

03:04.402 --> 03:08.202
with them. And this is from all three of the funds that

03:08.256 --> 03:11.558
affect the legal department the General Fund, the Property and Casualty,

03:11.654 --> 03:15.500
and the Workers Comp funds. It excludes any

03:15.950 --> 03:20.102
positions funded by enterprise funds. They're part of other

03:20.176 --> 03:23.310
department budgets, such as public works and airport.

03:24.610 --> 03:28.894
The next slide and

03:28.932 --> 03:32.926
the following one describe what we do some

03:32.948 --> 03:36.382
of the major areas. Of course, everyone here at the table is intimately

03:36.446 --> 03:40.834
familiar with it. I would like to point out that we do

03:41.032 --> 03:44.526
deal perhaps more than other cities in certain areas,

03:44.558 --> 03:47.000
such as planning and development issues.

03:47.770 --> 03:51.174
We don't follow the zoning scheme, the regulatory scheme that many

03:51.212 --> 03:53.910
cities do that presents particular challenges.

03:54.330 --> 03:57.750
We often deal with regulatory or

03:57.900 --> 04:02.134
statutory contract compliance. There are issues where the state challenges us

04:02.172 --> 04:06.026
on preemption issue of water rights and so on. So we have

04:06.048 --> 04:08.938
more activity than I think many cities do in that area.

04:09.104 --> 04:11.898
Also, with our protection of neighborhoods,

04:12.074 --> 04:15.370
again not being zoned deed restrictions,

04:15.530 --> 04:20.090
that brings up particular issues that requires a lot of investigation,

04:20.250 --> 04:24.482
assessment and analysis challenging those

04:24.536 --> 04:28.020
entities or persons who we believe are violating the law.

04:28.470 --> 04:31.826
And then we deal with a huge number of contracts and the

04:31.848 --> 04:35.654
contract issues. And I would like to point out now,

04:35.692 --> 04:38.370
although I could do it later, when I talk about some of the accomplishments,

04:38.450 --> 04:42.658
that in contracts, in government contracting,

04:42.834 --> 04:46.454
what is valued is transparency and

04:46.492 --> 04:50.786
avoiding any fraud or other illegalities that

04:50.828 --> 04:54.694
slows the process down. So we work constantly with strategic procurement

04:54.742 --> 04:58.266
to try to do our best to improve the processes and get the

04:58.288 --> 05:00.380
departments the contracts that they need.

05:01.490 --> 05:04.846
The next page shows some of what

05:04.868 --> 05:09.102
I'm talking about. And also our

05:09.156 --> 05:12.282
labor lawyers, in addition to litigation,

05:12.426 --> 05:16.478
have in fact their largest volume is probably the adverse matters,

05:16.494 --> 05:20.382
the contested case matters that are not litigated before the Civil Service Commission,

05:20.526 --> 05:24.114
issues before Department of labor or

05:24.152 --> 05:26.310
EEOC, things of that nature.

05:27.130 --> 05:30.850
In the following slide, it reflects

05:30.930 --> 05:35.362
in part some of our priorities of the financial or societal impact

05:35.506 --> 05:39.010
of service delivery. Our complete communities initiatives

05:39.090 --> 05:42.730
of the city is one where we provide

05:42.800 --> 05:46.346
support services. We try to do what we can to accelerate the

05:46.368 --> 05:49.706
process, whether it's a transactional or whether it's an assessment and

05:49.728 --> 05:53.114
analysis of what can be done. And then we anticipate

05:53.162 --> 05:56.446
growth in areas that have been growing for

05:56.468 --> 06:00.046
a number of years now. Public works with

06:00.148 --> 06:03.602
our aging infrastructure system and our utility system,

06:03.736 --> 06:07.460
the airport system always has new and

06:08.470 --> 06:12.034
pretty significant issues. Housing is going

06:12.072 --> 06:15.406
to continue to be an issue here in Houston and in most places

06:15.438 --> 06:19.990
in Texas for quite a while. The police department with

06:20.060 --> 06:23.926
the onesafe Houston is something that we have

06:23.948 --> 06:27.506
spent a big focus on, not only an ordinance, but I would

06:27.548 --> 06:30.858
like to point out the Office of

06:31.024 --> 06:34.410
Policing Accountability has

06:34.480 --> 06:37.290
been housed in our OIG department.

06:37.870 --> 06:41.814
It really takes the lead, crystal Lakora for in many of these initiatives,

06:41.862 --> 06:45.722
in explaining what's happening in the community, in taking complaints,

06:45.786 --> 06:49.066
in putting out as much information as we can so the public understands

06:49.098 --> 06:50.880
what the city of Houston is doing.

06:53.190 --> 06:56.466
The next slide gets we start getting into the

06:56.488 --> 07:00.626
numbers here. It's the following slide the

07:00.728 --> 07:04.340
revenue by funds and this is

07:04.790 --> 07:07.926
money that comes in. So I'll get to the expenditures next. But this

07:07.948 --> 07:11.960
is the revenue by funds and as you can see that

07:12.730 --> 07:16.470
there's an increase in both the general fund and property and casualty.

07:16.810 --> 07:20.746
Property and casualty fund revenue is just increased to

07:20.848 --> 07:24.730
reflect the increased expenditures. The general

07:24.800 --> 07:28.586
fund increase is due primarily to vacancies. We've had

07:28.608 --> 07:31.898
an issue in being able to staff our department.

07:32.074 --> 07:35.662
I think that's generally true of many local

07:35.716 --> 07:39.530
government, public sector legal departments.

07:39.610 --> 07:43.918
But here it has become a big issue that

07:44.004 --> 07:47.774
I think we've been able to solve by having market adjustments

07:47.822 --> 07:52.034
to increase. I think the mayor worked with us and he

07:52.072 --> 07:55.874
did, I thought, a remarkable job of being able to fund market increases.

07:55.922 --> 07:59.922
So we are no longer at the bottom of the major cities in Texas

07:59.986 --> 08:03.346
and then other major local government units

08:03.378 --> 08:05.190
such as Metro, Harris County.

08:07.710 --> 08:11.900
And the following slide reflects just what I was saying. Right now,

08:13.150 --> 08:16.506
the revenue highlights. The General Fund shows

08:16.688 --> 08:19.926
the vacancies of savings there and then the property and

08:19.968 --> 08:23.454
casualty revenues to match the expenditures in the funds. Now,

08:23.492 --> 08:27.194
the following slide gets into expenditure

08:27.242 --> 08:31.134
by funds and we

08:31.172 --> 08:34.660
go to the three major funds that I've discussed before.

08:35.270 --> 08:38.690
As you can see, there's a bigger bump in

08:38.760 --> 08:43.438
the Workers Comp Fund, but that's a smaller one. And so it's

08:43.454 --> 08:46.786
probably better to explain that and these others in the following slides where we

08:46.808 --> 08:50.214
can get into the details. But you can see here that the General Fund has

08:50.252 --> 08:53.750
an increase of about 17% and about 6%

08:53.820 --> 08:58.410
for the property and Casualty fund. So the following slide,

09:00.030 --> 09:04.186
if you look at this, you'll see the two dark bars toward the

09:04.208 --> 09:07.978
top. What's in under that first bar

09:08.144 --> 09:12.670
is really the net change to FY 2022.

09:12.820 --> 09:17.680
And then below the second bar is the FY 2023

09:18.210 --> 09:21.760
expenditure. So what you can see here is

09:22.450 --> 09:26.242
we have an operating budget to begin with. Then you

09:26.296 --> 09:28.450
add in the Hope adjustment,

09:30.630 --> 09:34.910
then you have additional staff and pay adjustments.

09:34.990 --> 09:38.214
So that is part of what I was talking about before with the

09:38.252 --> 09:41.394
increase. And then below that you have restricted accounts.

09:41.442 --> 09:44.760
And restricted accounts are it Application Data services.

09:45.450 --> 09:49.180
The law has increasingly become dependent on technology

09:49.550 --> 09:52.586
in order to be able to do the job that you need to do to

09:52.608 --> 09:54.380
provide quality legal work.

09:56.990 --> 10:00.134
Going below the second bar, if you look at the

10:00.272 --> 10:03.840
FY 2023, you can see there

10:04.450 --> 10:07.440
a reflection of some of the remarks I've made to date.

10:08.770 --> 10:12.442
The program adjustments are in the department market

10:12.516 --> 10:15.906
salary increase, the additional staff and

10:15.928 --> 10:19.742
pay adjustments, and then the parenthetical,

10:19.806 --> 10:23.570
the 216. The negative just reflects a personnel transfer

10:23.640 --> 10:27.858
from one fund to another. Then there are contractual

10:28.034 --> 10:30.760
or mandated adjustments. That includes Hope,

10:31.370 --> 10:35.334
again, restricted accounts and then health benefits make

10:35.372 --> 10:39.002
up that last number, 44. And so

10:39.056 --> 10:43.126
if you look at the difference between the two budgets, that yields

10:43.158 --> 10:45.740
a 17% change.

10:49.710 --> 10:52.790
This was set up to set questions for last. But if you

10:52.800 --> 10:56.234
have questions at any point, please ask me. I don't want to overlook a slide

10:56.282 --> 11:00.986
where it may be confusing to you. The following

11:01.178 --> 11:04.590
slide slide ten. This is the highlights.

11:04.670 --> 11:07.922
It's an important aspect of the increase is the market

11:07.976 --> 11:11.682
salary increase to bring us up to competitive with the

11:11.736 --> 11:15.426
other entities to which we were

11:15.448 --> 11:18.758
losing attorneys, frankly, in addition to the

11:18.764 --> 11:22.358
private sector. And then the funding that is required to

11:22.364 --> 11:26.194
be made for health benefits, for hope and so on. And then the funding

11:26.242 --> 11:29.946
for our outside counsel, litigation support, claims and

11:29.968 --> 11:30.730
judgments.

11:33.150 --> 11:37.514
The following slide number eleven is

11:37.632 --> 11:41.100
this. Now I begin a series of charts to show

11:42.190 --> 11:45.902
where the money is going within a fund. So this is the general fund.

11:46.036 --> 11:49.246
If you look at the left, you'll see that

11:49.348 --> 11:53.214
personnel makes up 92% of the costs. And that's very typical for

11:53.252 --> 11:56.414
any legal department, law firm anywhere.

11:56.462 --> 11:59.650
That's generally where you have a huge bulk of your cost.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.946
Non personnel is 8%. The pie chart to

12:02.968 --> 12:07.282
the right, where the arrow is pointing, breaks down the non personnel.

12:07.426 --> 12:11.030
So you have the restricted accounts that make up about

12:11.100 --> 12:14.850
half. And those restricted accounts are the It applications,

12:14.930 --> 12:18.470
data Services, voice Services, insurance Fees,

12:18.550 --> 12:22.234
GIS, HR, client Services, things of that

12:22.272 --> 12:25.898
nature. Then you have other services that make up 18%.

12:25.984 --> 12:29.318
And this is Annex. Parking software, maintenance,

12:29.414 --> 12:32.250
mail services, code of ordinance printing,

12:33.390 --> 12:38.074
CLE bar dues. Travel supplies

12:38.122 --> 12:41.520
are office and computer supplies. That's another 12%.

12:42.050 --> 12:45.506
General Office Services. Those are in the nature of

12:45.528 --> 12:48.962
Westlaw title data. And then paying

12:49.016 --> 12:52.786
the Harris County Department of Ed for archived services, and then

12:52.808 --> 12:56.618
the legal services. The 9% is outside counsel

12:56.734 --> 13:00.562
that we use for immigration visas, artificial intelligence,

13:00.626 --> 13:04.662
things of that nature. And then supplies are your standard office

13:04.716 --> 13:06.230
and computer supplies.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.968
The next slide, twelve shows the property

13:14.054 --> 13:18.048
and casualty fund. And there you see the numbers

13:18.134 --> 13:21.456
are reversed because this

13:21.478 --> 13:24.576
is from which we pay our claims. So personnel makes

13:24.598 --> 13:28.900
up only 35%, whereas non personnel makes up 65%.

13:29.050 --> 13:33.044
And then looking at the pie chart to the right, you can see that the

13:33.082 --> 13:36.952
bulk of the expenditures there are

13:37.006 --> 13:40.440
anticipated for claims, settlements, judgments, attorneys fees,

13:41.340 --> 13:44.840
legal services are outside counsel fees,

13:45.820 --> 13:49.144
litigation support. Those are expert witnesses,

13:49.192 --> 13:52.696
court reporters, medical services, document reading,

13:52.728 --> 13:56.350
things of that nature. Then we have supplies and

13:56.800 --> 14:00.396
restricted accounts, and then other services which were the

14:00.578 --> 14:04.480
professional and membership fees, west law, travel, things of that nature.

14:08.570 --> 14:12.200
Then the next slide shows the workers comp.

14:13.130 --> 14:16.218
And as you can see, personnel makes up the bulk of

14:16.224 --> 14:20.090
that, about three, four, and then non personnel

14:21.150 --> 14:24.746
is about a fourth. And if you look at to the

14:24.768 --> 14:27.870
right, you'll see that the restricted accounts, again, the It

14:27.940 --> 14:31.326
Application Data Services, et cetera, make up the bulk of

14:31.348 --> 14:34.766
that supplies, a small amount. And then the other services,

14:34.868 --> 14:38.958
the parking, the software, and so on.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.494
So that's how the workers fund compensation fund breaks

14:42.542 --> 14:45.586
down. So at this point,

14:45.768 --> 14:49.874
I'm opening up to questions, and all I really have left after that is

14:49.912 --> 14:53.174
just a glossary, our chart, and then some

14:53.212 --> 14:57.430
demographic data and the department accomplishments.

14:58.970 --> 15:02.150
Thank you, Arturo, for your presentation.

15:02.570 --> 15:06.106
A couple of questions. Try to explain to

15:06.128 --> 15:10.442
the public. The main differences between your

15:10.496 --> 15:13.578
public law practice and a private law practice? Are there things within

15:13.664 --> 15:18.766
your department that we are significantly lacking as

15:18.788 --> 15:22.654
opposed to a private law firm? Whether it's with software or any other

15:22.692 --> 15:23.710
applications,

15:26.370 --> 15:30.420
certain law firms can afford the newest and the best technology

15:32.230 --> 15:34.946
we have been able to manage. Obviously,

15:35.128 --> 15:38.786
with more funds you can purchase more

15:38.888 --> 15:42.186
also more of the technology so it's spread out among fewer

15:42.238 --> 15:45.080
people when you do that. We have, for example,

15:46.810 --> 15:50.322
body camera footage that has to be reviewed,

15:50.386 --> 15:53.814
that has to be edited to pinpoint, to be able to present

15:54.012 --> 15:58.390
in any litigation or any other matter. So you do have that constraint,

15:58.470 --> 16:02.170
but we have been able to find

16:02.240 --> 16:05.914
funds to get the software and the technology we need,

16:05.952 --> 16:09.406
we think, to be able to do as good a job as can be

16:09.428 --> 16:13.230
expected. Are there any outside of the general

16:13.300 --> 16:16.778
fund opportunities for additional dollars or funds

16:16.794 --> 16:21.150
that come into your department outside

16:21.300 --> 16:24.420
of property casualty or general fund?

16:25.990 --> 16:28.866
We sometimes recover funds. I mean, we did it,

16:28.968 --> 16:32.294
we recovered funds for the city a significant amount when

16:32.332 --> 16:35.874
we were sent defective masks during the pandemic.

16:35.922 --> 16:39.426
For example, we recently settled

16:39.458 --> 16:43.206
the Allens Creek Reservoir matter that

16:43.388 --> 16:47.190
we took issue with state legislation we were able to prevail

16:47.350 --> 16:51.098
and we received, even if it's not in direct dollars

16:51.184 --> 16:55.180
over time, what I think will be substantial savings to the city.

16:55.630 --> 16:59.386
I think you had mentioned in your presentation that the

16:59.408 --> 17:02.846
city of Houston at one point in time was towards the bottom when it

17:02.868 --> 17:05.514
came to is that major cities of competitive salary?

17:05.642 --> 17:08.350
Yes, that's right. That would be San Antonio,

17:08.770 --> 17:12.846
Dallas, Fort Worth. And also comparing locally here to Harris

17:12.878 --> 17:14.900
County and Metro. Where are we now?

17:17.990 --> 17:21.380
We're at the median. We're right there.

17:21.830 --> 17:24.754
We think where we should be for the time being. And what are our efforts

17:24.802 --> 17:28.514
for recruitment at the different law firms of the law schools

17:28.562 --> 17:30.950
to try to attain the best talent?

17:33.610 --> 17:37.194
Frankly, I think we need to probably take

17:37.232 --> 17:40.746
a more direct approach to working with the local law schools, working with

17:40.768 --> 17:43.610
the deans. I've had a couple of conversations.

17:44.030 --> 17:48.122
We do get a lot of interest from

17:48.176 --> 17:51.454
lawyers and we have been able to, I think,

17:51.492 --> 17:55.146
hire some talented young lawyers from the local law schools

17:55.178 --> 17:59.038
or who coming out of practice here. We do sometimes have a

17:59.044 --> 18:02.238
bit difficulty trying to hire in some of the more specialty areas,

18:02.334 --> 18:05.380
for example water rights or It technology.

18:06.550 --> 18:10.610
Thank you. Next, we'll have questions by council member Abby Cayman.

18:12.150 --> 18:15.880
Thank you. Vice Chair city Attorney. Michelle, first off,

18:16.250 --> 18:20.022
just a huge thank you and moment

18:20.076 --> 18:23.880
of gratitude to you and the entire team. I know that you break down

18:25.450 --> 18:28.666
all the different specialties that your office takes care of,

18:28.688 --> 18:32.406
but I don't think it's really hard to grasp

18:32.598 --> 18:36.234
how much you all actually do day in and day

18:36.272 --> 18:39.280
out, all of the different matters that you all have eyes on.

18:40.210 --> 18:42.990
Remind me how many people are in your department,

18:43.810 --> 18:47.726
roughly? I think we have about 170.

18:47.828 --> 18:51.810
I know that's not precise, but that's okay. But again,

18:51.880 --> 18:55.934
thank you, because I know we often see items

18:55.982 --> 18:59.860
come up where we're seeking outside counsel, but that doesn't take away from

19:00.310 --> 19:03.782
the extensive amount of work that you all do. And thank you for always

19:03.836 --> 19:07.302
being so responsive to my office on things.

19:07.436 --> 19:11.106
Really quickly, the court

19:11.138 --> 19:14.918
backlogs and delays that we've seen that the county

19:14.934 --> 19:18.682
is facing, how has that had an impact, if any, on city

19:18.736 --> 19:22.758
related litigation? I think it's primarily

19:22.854 --> 19:26.042
affected it in two ways.

19:26.096 --> 19:30.526
One, I think our municipal courts, now that in

19:30.548 --> 19:34.746
person hearings and trials are occurring,

19:34.938 --> 19:38.750
you have a rush now because of the backlog, although it wasn't quite

19:38.900 --> 19:42.386
what it was in the civil courts. What I think we

19:42.408 --> 19:46.174
see in the civil courts in an area that we've had some concern

19:46.222 --> 19:50.222
because we've been trying to staff, is really in the tort cases.

19:50.366 --> 19:54.382
And so now that the courts are backlogged, we're seeing

19:54.456 --> 19:58.342
more and more, and particularly when we need lawyers and also

19:58.396 --> 20:02.326
paralegals, it's been difficult to find paralegals. It's difficult to compete with the

20:02.348 --> 20:08.074
private sector, too. So I think that has just really added to the

20:08.112 --> 20:12.154
constraints that we have as a public entity law firm during

20:12.192 --> 20:15.274
the pandemic. I know, for example, when lots of people

20:15.312 --> 20:19.134
are home, we got at least the district offices, a lot more

20:19.172 --> 20:22.638
calls, right, of issues and things like that. Did your office see

20:22.724 --> 20:26.894
a higher influx or

20:26.932 --> 20:29.850
cases and issues remaining steady?

20:30.010 --> 20:33.674
Yeah, I think that there were particular

20:33.812 --> 20:36.782
challenges and different types of issues that had to be raised,

20:36.846 --> 20:40.594
that we had to address. And I think much of that happened before I

20:40.632 --> 20:43.974
arrived. And I think Deirdre Penny and Randy Zamora and the team did

20:44.012 --> 20:46.760
an excellent job. Absolutely. And finally,

20:47.290 --> 20:50.742
what are the needs, given the financial constraints that the city

20:50.796 --> 20:54.662
continues to face, the revenue cap, et cetera? What are the needs

20:54.716 --> 20:58.326
of the foreseeable future that we should be aware of that aren't

20:58.518 --> 21:01.420
addressed in this in your budget this year?

21:02.350 --> 21:05.910
I think if you had a wish list, you would probably try to expand

21:05.990 --> 21:09.562
more in support services within the department,

21:09.706 --> 21:13.326
paralegals the ability to

21:13.348 --> 21:17.194
investigate claims, particularly in the neighborhood. For example, if you look at neighborhood

21:17.242 --> 21:21.006
services, they filed eleven Chapter

21:21.038 --> 21:25.278
125 lawsuits. They've been successful in challenging Sobs

21:25.374 --> 21:28.820
bars Spiveys on Blodgett Street, for example.

21:29.430 --> 21:33.614
But those take time and those take efforts in addition to what HPD

21:33.662 --> 21:36.760
provides. Thank you. And if it would be possible,

21:37.290 --> 21:40.550
Vice Chair, to put me back in queue, I'd appreciate it.

21:40.620 --> 21:44.146
Sure. I also want to welcome Council Member Amy Peck,

21:44.258 --> 21:47.994
council Member Mary NAN Huffman, and Council Member David Robinson to

21:48.032 --> 21:51.414
the chambers. Next, we'll have questions and staff

21:51.462 --> 21:55.206
from District K and District D council member Sally

21:55.238 --> 21:58.010
Alcorn. Thank you, Chair.

21:58.670 --> 22:02.078
And shout out to Randy Zamora for all the good work he did on

22:02.084 --> 22:06.510
the noise ordinance sitting there behind you on paper reduction.

22:06.930 --> 22:09.934
Legal is a lot of paper. And are you all doing,

22:09.972 --> 22:13.826
DocuSigns? Are you all trying to cut down on contract papers going back and

22:13.848 --> 22:16.500
forth? Can you describe a little bit of your efforts there?

22:16.870 --> 22:20.946
Yeah, I think we pay money to Harris County Department of

22:20.968 --> 22:24.898
Ed to archive, and we need to go as paperless

22:24.994 --> 22:29.506
as possible. That can't be done in all instances depending

22:29.538 --> 22:32.630
on what a particular court you're in and what's being required.

22:32.970 --> 22:36.378
We have that, but I think everyone in

22:36.384 --> 22:40.090
the department is conscious of the need to use less paper.

22:40.240 --> 22:44.054
It affects our bottom line, and frankly, it makes it more efficient

22:44.102 --> 22:47.834
in being able to identify and find something after

22:47.872 --> 22:51.962
the fact. So there's not really an orchestrated effort.

22:52.026 --> 22:55.838
It's just kind of, let's try to do better, or is there anything kind

22:55.844 --> 22:59.642
of in place to there is specific reduction efforts.

22:59.786 --> 23:03.460
There is not a plan.

23:05.670 --> 23:08.434
I'm going to take that under advisement and look at it and see what other

23:08.472 --> 23:12.146
departments are doing in order to do that. I do know that

23:12.328 --> 23:15.990
it just makes us more efficient when we do that. And I think every lawyer,

23:18.170 --> 23:21.494
our lawyers are frankly overwhelmed in what they have to do,

23:21.532 --> 23:24.726
and they will always find ways to make it more efficient. But you bring up

23:24.748 --> 23:26.540
a good point. Thank you.

23:28.590 --> 23:31.818
That is a good point. I know that my law firm, we try to

23:31.824 --> 23:35.658
be efficient with going paperless, but you kind of

23:35.824 --> 23:39.482
are also very accustomed to having those

23:39.536 --> 23:42.794
paper files in front of you and you like to grab them and write notes

23:42.842 --> 23:46.682
and you know where they are. And sometimes going paperless

23:46.746 --> 23:49.994
at a law firm, it sounds like it could be more efficient,

23:50.042 --> 23:53.662
but sometimes it could be a little frustrating

23:53.726 --> 23:57.202
as well. So I know that that balance is something that you all will continue

23:57.256 --> 23:59.700
to consider and find a way to make it work.

24:00.630 --> 24:03.800
Council member amy Abby Cayman. Sorry,

24:06.890 --> 24:08.360
it was a close one.

24:10.890 --> 24:14.054
City Attorney as it relates to

24:14.252 --> 24:17.466
numbers and metrics, it's hard, right? Some departments can

24:17.488 --> 24:20.102
have easy metrics. Your department,

24:20.166 --> 24:23.274
what someone may think is a win in court is

24:23.312 --> 24:26.886
actually a better win because we have a settlement, less court costs,

24:26.918 --> 24:30.446
et cetera. Do you track

24:30.628 --> 24:34.526
numbers and things like that? How much dollars are

24:34.548 --> 24:37.520
generated from settlements, things of that nature that would be available?

24:39.430 --> 24:43.314
Yeah, we do. Much of our

24:43.352 --> 24:46.946
litigation is defensive, so you also would

24:46.968 --> 24:52.110
have to look at the amount sought realistically,

24:52.190 --> 24:55.454
what we felt a judge or jury could award,

24:55.502 --> 24:58.390
and if we were able to settle for less things of that nature.

24:58.970 --> 25:02.806
We do have litigation where we're the plaintiff that we can

25:02.828 --> 25:06.522
look at that. But yeah, we do have that data. Okay, again,

25:06.576 --> 25:10.870
just wondering. I think you all do a phenomenal job, as council

25:11.370 --> 25:14.250
members mentioned, randy, with the sound ordinance,

25:14.830 --> 25:18.654
the didras as I like to say on multiple things. But again,

25:18.692 --> 25:22.126
the entire team just really appreciate all

25:22.148 --> 25:24.320
of y'all's work. Thank you.

25:26.770 --> 25:30.906
Well, again, we want to thank you for your presentation, City Attorney

25:30.938 --> 25:34.574
Michelle, and to you and your entire staff for all the contributions.

25:34.622 --> 25:37.986
We know you all do a lot with a little, and you all do a

25:38.008 --> 25:41.730
great job of collaborating and engaging with our offices. So continue

25:41.800 --> 25:45.314
the good work and thank you again, and you may be dismissed.

25:45.362 --> 25:48.694
Thank you. We will now begin

25:48.732 --> 25:52.550
the public comment period. We will start with our virtual public

25:52.620 --> 25:56.394
speakers. Please press star six to unmute. When you hear

25:56.432 --> 26:00.060
your name, the first speaker will be

26:00.910 --> 26:04.390
Saba Blanding. Please press hi. Good afternoon.

26:04.470 --> 26:07.654
Can you all hear me okay? Yes, ma'am. Okay,

26:07.712 --> 26:11.502
wonderful. I had a few questions on slide 20.

26:11.556 --> 26:15.118
It says that the legal department negotiated police and

26:15.204 --> 26:18.506
municipal employee union contracts. I was wondering

26:18.538 --> 26:22.126
if there's a plan to make this process public like in other cities,

26:22.238 --> 26:25.506
and if not, why? I was also curious when

26:25.528 --> 26:29.202
and how the Office of Policing Reform and Accountability is

26:29.256 --> 26:32.562
planning to implement community led recommendations

26:32.626 --> 26:36.326
around policing beyond the mayor's appointees. I was

26:36.348 --> 26:39.602
also curious council Member came and addressed this in an earlier department

26:39.666 --> 26:42.914
presentation. But what are plans to extend

26:42.962 --> 26:46.730
the prenatal parental and infant wellness leave ordinance?

26:47.150 --> 26:50.522
And finally, I was personally curious about

26:50.576 --> 26:54.650
what percentage of funding, for one, Safe Houston is outside of HPD.

26:54.990 --> 26:58.366
Particularly curious about violence interruption and prevention measures and

26:58.388 --> 27:02.174
youth outreach. It makes sense how it's set up on the website by

27:02.372 --> 27:05.594
an issue. But just in terms of budgeting, I'm curious

27:05.642 --> 27:08.030
how the breakout is with departments.

27:09.010 --> 27:12.306
Ms. Blanding, I'm going to give you some additional time because I know you were

27:12.328 --> 27:15.506
kind of running through those questions so that we

27:15.528 --> 27:19.170
could ensure that we got it all in the allotted time. But can you please

27:19.240 --> 27:23.154
repeat question one and speak a little slower

27:23.202 --> 27:25.720
for us? Yeah,

27:28.890 --> 27:31.880
sorry. You know, I'm trying to get in, like, 23 questions.

27:33.050 --> 27:36.646
My first question was that on slide 20, it says that the

27:36.668 --> 27:40.614
legal department is the one that negotiates the police and municipal

27:40.662 --> 27:44.314
Employees union contracts. And I was curious if there's a

27:44.352 --> 27:47.594
plan to make this process public like in other cities, including in

27:47.632 --> 27:51.226
Texas. And if not, why not? That was my

27:51.248 --> 27:54.814
first question. So on that first question, you are right.

27:54.852 --> 27:58.938
The city legal department does negotiate

27:58.954 --> 28:02.370
with the Houston Police Officers Union. I think when it comes

28:02.440 --> 28:06.366
to plans moving forward, that is something that will be discussed

28:06.398 --> 28:10.210
between the mayor and the city attorney

28:10.710 --> 28:14.006
each particular year on their vision and their perspective on what

28:14.028 --> 28:17.666
may be beneficial for the city of Houston as it pertains to the negotiation

28:17.698 --> 28:22.294
process. We are aware that other cities do have what

28:22.332 --> 28:25.800
may be considered a more open process,

28:26.250 --> 28:29.302
but those considerations lie solely with the mayor,

28:29.366 --> 28:32.170
his vision, and working with the city attorney.

28:35.390 --> 28:38.458
Did you need me to repeat my other questions. I know I was trying to

28:38.464 --> 28:42.158
get them really quick. Yes, please. Okay.

28:42.324 --> 28:46.190
I was getting a little winded too. So my second question

28:46.340 --> 28:49.834
was when and how is the Office of Policing Reform

28:49.882 --> 28:53.790
and Accountability planning to implement community led recommendations

28:53.870 --> 28:57.890
around policing? So just beyond the appointees, some more community led input?

28:59.270 --> 29:02.386
Yeah, I think that's a great question, and I would like to see that as

29:02.408 --> 29:06.242
well. I would request that

29:06.296 --> 29:09.766
the chair of the Public Safety Committee kind of look into that somewhat to

29:09.788 --> 29:13.286
see if that's something we can get on the schedule as a way in

29:13.308 --> 29:16.746
which we can take questions from the public to be

29:16.768 --> 29:20.154
able to submit to that

29:20.192 --> 29:23.994
oversight office and then be able to provide some

29:24.032 --> 29:27.210
type of feedback. Or you can always reach out directly to

29:27.280 --> 29:31.354
your specific district Council member on advocating

29:31.402 --> 29:35.022
for that as well. For the District J office,

29:35.076 --> 29:38.526
I can say that I would lean towards trying to find a way to

29:38.548 --> 29:42.274
collaborate with Ms. O'core to do

29:42.312 --> 29:45.586
maybe a virtual town hall where

29:45.608 --> 29:49.522
we can submit some questions from the public and then be able to provide

29:49.576 --> 29:50.690
those answers.

29:54.490 --> 29:58.554
Okay. And to repeat my third question, and this is more to

29:58.592 --> 30:02.358
Council Member Cayman, perhaps you addressed

30:02.374 --> 30:05.834
this in an earlier department presentation, but I was curious about any

30:05.872 --> 30:09.034
plans to extend the prenatal Parental and Infant Wellness

30:09.082 --> 30:14.378
Leave Ordinance saba

30:14.394 --> 30:17.914
as it relates to expansion of the paid parental

30:17.962 --> 30:21.314
leave program. All City

30:21.352 --> 30:24.770
of Houston employees are currently covered.

30:25.350 --> 30:28.866
The mayor has asked and we as council members are

30:28.888 --> 30:32.914
encouraging affiliated arms of

30:32.952 --> 30:36.358
the city that may not be within council's direct control, for example,

30:36.444 --> 30:39.830
Metro, Houston, first, et cetera, to begin

30:39.900 --> 30:43.494
looking at that for their employees as

30:43.532 --> 30:45.646
well as for contractors,

30:45.778 --> 30:49.434
subcontractors, et cetera. I do know that other work

30:49.472 --> 30:53.020
is being done by the Women's Commission, but I cannot speak to that.

30:54.510 --> 30:58.060
Okay, I appreciate that clarification about the process.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.914
And then my final question was what percentage of funding

31:01.962 --> 31:05.322
for one Safe Houston is outside of HPD?

31:05.466 --> 31:09.626
And I was particularly curious about the violence interruption and prevention measures

31:09.658 --> 31:13.746
and the youth outreach. So right now on the website, it's broken down by

31:13.848 --> 31:17.394
domestic violence, which makes sense. But as

31:17.432 --> 31:21.070
this is budget hearings and we're looking at particular department budgets,

31:21.150 --> 31:24.142
I was curious to see those numbers by department.

31:24.286 --> 31:27.746
So that was my final question, and I appreciate the time to kind of repeat

31:27.778 --> 31:31.302
in a non rushed manner. Great question. We will

31:31.436 --> 31:34.678
get that final answer for you to make sure that

31:34.684 --> 31:37.866
we have the specific line items and broken down for you in

31:37.888 --> 31:42.010
an itemized fashion. So please ensure that you send that specific

31:42.080 --> 31:46.234
question over to the District E at houstontx Gov and

31:46.272 --> 31:48.250
then we will respond promptly.

31:51.330 --> 31:55.790
Thank you. Our next public speaker is Mr. Jason Oliver.

32:00.300 --> 32:03.540
Oh, perfect. Okay, good afternoon,

32:03.620 --> 32:07.290
everyone. So, first, let's see.

32:08.780 --> 32:12.464
Okay, so I'm curious about the municipal,

32:12.532 --> 32:15.692
the employee contracts as well and I also

32:15.746 --> 32:19.244
know that the municipal contracts are a lot more transparent

32:19.292 --> 32:23.484
than, say, the police union. And we haven't had fire negotiations

32:23.532 --> 32:27.216
in a long time. But I'm curious about how much in

32:27.238 --> 32:31.036
raises have been authorized for each of the three major employee groups.

32:31.068 --> 32:34.324
I know that's a little bit detailed, so I'll make sure to send

32:34.362 --> 32:38.404
that one in second. This is going along with

32:38.522 --> 32:42.044
Council Member Pollard. I know you brought the transparency

32:42.112 --> 32:45.320
dashboard project comport. I'm curious about

32:45.390 --> 32:49.960
how many complaints have been received through that dashboard and

32:50.030 --> 32:53.576
how can we bring because it doesn't actually publish the

32:53.598 --> 32:57.004
complaints like Project Comport does. I'm hoping that we can bring that

32:57.042 --> 33:00.536
back into the scope of this new dashboard that's

33:00.568 --> 33:03.070
been put together. And then finally,

33:03.680 --> 33:07.756
neighborhood support for deed restriction has

33:07.778 --> 33:11.488
been a big need that I've heard from community members. I'm curious about

33:11.574 --> 33:15.356
if it's possible to expand the types of legal

33:15.388 --> 33:18.764
support that the department can offer to communities

33:18.812 --> 33:23.030
and, like, civic clubs that are looking for deed restriction support.

33:24.680 --> 33:28.900
All right, great question. I believe on the employee

33:29.400 --> 33:33.092
contracts fire, they receive

33:33.156 --> 33:36.970
6% increase over the next three years.

33:39.420 --> 33:43.530
Police receive 4%, and municipal employees 3%.

33:44.240 --> 33:48.220
As it pertains to the Police Transparency Dashboard,

33:49.360 --> 33:53.016
those numbers are consistently being reevaluated.

33:53.128 --> 33:56.990
And as you have a question to that,

33:58.480 --> 34:02.272
wanting to know more about how many inquiries are coming into that

34:02.406 --> 34:05.632
portal, so do I. And so I will be reaching out to Mr.

34:05.686 --> 34:09.136
Core for those answers as well. And I

34:09.158 --> 34:13.364
think we need to do a better job as a city in really highlighting the

34:13.402 --> 34:16.576
Police Transparency Dashboard. That's something that I'm proud

34:16.608 --> 34:20.432
of, but not enough people kind of understand the functionality

34:20.496 --> 34:23.816
of it, as well as kind of how to navigate it and use

34:23.838 --> 34:27.080
it to their benefit. So I'm going to put that on my shoulders

34:27.820 --> 34:31.848
to get more engagement from the public and awareness on

34:31.934 --> 34:35.816
how to utilize that. And my

34:35.838 --> 34:38.332
office will reach out to you directly. I'm going to make a note of that

34:38.386 --> 34:42.350
so that we can collaborate on getting some engagement. And then

34:43.520 --> 34:47.148
your third question was the

34:47.314 --> 34:50.656
increased deed restriction enforcement support.

34:50.838 --> 34:54.764
So, of course, as you heard in the presentation earlier, our legal department

34:54.812 --> 35:00.604
is spread pretty thin as it is with all of the different practice

35:00.652 --> 35:04.416
areas that they cover. So to add on to that with civic

35:04.448 --> 35:07.060
clubs or HOAs when it comes to D restrictions,

35:07.880 --> 35:11.536
I think would be challenging. So we have to be creative in our approach

35:11.568 --> 35:15.096
in working with Lone Star Legal Aid and others to be able to bring

35:15.118 --> 35:18.664
forth those services to the public. I know in District J, we have

35:18.702 --> 35:22.932
several entities like the India House and Catholic

35:22.996 --> 35:26.732
Charities who provide weekend legal services for

35:26.786 --> 35:31.036
residents at no cost. And so we need to do a

35:31.058 --> 35:34.952
better job in maybe getting that information out to our constituents.

35:35.016 --> 35:38.872
And so I would request that everyone please sign up for your

35:38.946 --> 35:42.448
district council. Members newsletters because they put a

35:42.454 --> 35:45.712
lot of good information out there regarding those issues.

35:45.766 --> 35:49.410
And I know with the district J. Pollard Press, we try to provide

35:50.100 --> 35:53.744
information on free legal services each month for

35:53.782 --> 35:55.170
our residents as well.

35:58.260 --> 36:00.910
That concludes the public speakers list.
