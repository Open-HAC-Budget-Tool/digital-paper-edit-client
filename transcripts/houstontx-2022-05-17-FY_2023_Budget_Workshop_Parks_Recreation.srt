1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,786
And council staff like to welcome Council Member

2
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:06,750
Amy Peck.

I can't even see that because the Claire so

4
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:04,516
at this time I'd like to welcome Director Kenneth Allen and Miss

00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:19,208
to go right there. All right, well, good morning.

9
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:23,256
Thank you pro Tim and City Council for

10
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:26,956
just allowing us to present and your continuous support of

11
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:30,396
the Houston Parks and Recreation Department. Certainly over

12
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:34,364
the last three years, we've had to adjust and pivot and

13
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:37,676
make things work the best that we can.

14
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:41,208
Partnering with other directors, other partners,

15
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:45,404
has certainly been a challenge to deliver just regular parks and recreation

16
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:48,844
services. But when you think about us being as Lily

17
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:52,312
Paz, shelter sites, distribution sites,

18
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:56,164
just really doing things to accommodate the needs

19
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:59,716
of the public, I am so proud of the team that I have

20
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:02,630
the honor and pleasure of managing day to day.

21
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,744
And these are guys and women with boots on the ground that

22
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:10,628
are actually delittering our parks, actually mowing,

23
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:14,228
actually repairing roofs, plumbing,

24
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:17,380
and the staff that work with our children day to day.

25
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,452
I am so very proud of them because they go beyond and

26
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:25,084
above the call of duty. They work with the resources that

27
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:28,348
we have, sometime limited. But guess what?

28
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:32,732
They've made a way out of no way. And we do have some gaps,

29
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:36,528
but we are striving to continue to provide

30
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:40,336
services the best we can with what we have. So I want to honor them

31
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:43,924
and I want to thank them for their day to day effort. It takes a

32
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:47,904
huge coordination effort with my executive

33
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:51,968
team working hand in hand with their direct reports.

34
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:55,972
And I have them with me today. I like to introduce have many of them

pretty holistic, and it's to enhance the quality of

75
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:24,336
urban life by providing safe, well maintained parks

76
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:28,010
and offering affordable programming for our community.

77
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,348
We provide fitness, sports opportunities,

00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:49,532
operate by a standard of care, which is a mandatory

83
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:53,420
requirement for our after school and summer enrichment programs.

84
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,330
And then we provide free mills throughout the city for use

85
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,224
summer and fall. Through a federal grant

86
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:06,164
administered by the Texas Department of Agriculture. We have

87
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:09,924

00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:13,300

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,096
for other facilities throughout our system.

90
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:21,530
Next slide, please. We manage park land

91
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,252
expansions, constructions, renovations,

92
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:29,172

93
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:32,616
compliance with all part building codes, fire codes,

94
00:06:32,648 --> 00:06:36,412

95
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:39,740
when you guys think about it, our entire inventory,

96
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,736
we have maintenance, and we maintain over 39,000 acres of

97
00:06:44,758 --> 00:06:48,604
land of parkland. This includes over 380

98
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:53,220

99
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,264

101
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:04,260
as well as multi service centers. Next slide,

102
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,180
please. That's a huge inventory, and it takes teamwork

103
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,330
and working together and working with council and partners to

104
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,896
adequately serve the public. We're short in some areas

105
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:22,044
and we'll identify those, but I want to go to our revenues by

106
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:26,520
fund. If you look at our proposed budget revenues

107
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,320
by Fund for FY 23, we have our general

108
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,410
fund budget, we're proposing 793,000.

109
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,250
We have Fund 2100, which is our revenue fund.

110
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,576
Our proposed budget is 3 million, and that's

111
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:47,984
actually for events, birthday parties,

112
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:52,432
park facilities, team registrations, tree violation,

113
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:56,376
fines, lake Houston rentals, and the

114
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:59,544
rentals for tennis centers in terms of revenue. And then we have

115
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:02,490
Fund 21 four, our golf revenue fund,

116
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,804
we're anticipating or expecting 7.8 million in

117
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:11,560
revenue for Fund 21 five, our maintenance,

118
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,860
renewal and replacement, we're proposing 2.6

119
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,892
million. And then Fund 21 six, which is our bio

120
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:24,496
greenways, 2021.4 million.

121
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:28,124
Next slide, please. Terms of FY

122
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:31,200
23 revenue and some of the highlights.

123
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,044
This is our proposed FY 23 budget. Compared to

124
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:38,356
our FY 22 estimate. You look at our

125
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:40,150
general fund 1000,

126
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,390
we're saying 1000 less.

127
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,650
So I know that's not significant, but the fact that it's it's less

128
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,080
wanted that to be known. Look at Fund 2100 special

129
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:01,468
revenue, we're proposing to make 468,000

130
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:05,384
more. And this is budget revenue that's projected

131
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:08,956
because of pre pandemic trends.

132
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:12,972
Also contributions from the Astros Golf Foundation

133
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:16,192
for playground initiatives. So if you look at 21

134
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:19,836
four in terms of golf revenue, in terms of highlights,

135
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:23,970
we're proposing 565,000.

136
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,204
We're hosting the Houston Open once again, and we're projected to

137
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:33,110
increase some streams of revenue for golf as a result of

138
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,536
the tournament and some of the things that we're doing with the Open.

139
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:39,652
We look at Fund 21 Five, maintenance,

140
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:43,252
renewal, and replacement. We're projecting

141
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:46,508
300,000 contributions again, from the

142
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:49,992
Astros Golf Foundation. For neighborhood park

143
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,164
projects, we're looking at Fund 21 six,

144
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:57,532
bio greenways, we're projecting 270K

145
00:09:57,586 --> 00:10:00,690
for that. Next slide, please.

146
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,076
Expenditures by fund. This is FY 20 three's

147
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:08,850
budget compared to FY 22.

148
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,588
Look at Fund and I'll go in more detail with this slide as we move,

149
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:17,476
as we progress through the presentation. But if you look at Fund

150
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:21,076

00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,692
Next slide, please. For our

175
00:11:56,746 --> 00:12:00,500
maintenance, renewal and replacement, fund 21 Five,

176
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,824
personnel is 35% of the budget at 1.1

177
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:08,712
million. And then we have non personnel at 65% of the budget at

178
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:12,084
2.1 million. Next slide,

179
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,792
please. So,

180
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:17,932
Valo Greenways 2020, fund 21 six,

181
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:21,932
we have personnel at 83% of the budget at 1 million,

182
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:26,030
and we have non personnel at 17% of the budget at

183
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,524
212,000. Next slide,

184
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:34,032
please. So this slide actually

185
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,644
is it compares

186
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:41,152
FY 22s budget to FY 23 proposed budget,

187
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:45,456
and it describes the changes between the budgets.

188
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:49,524
Next slide, please. If you look at when we

189
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:52,500
focus on 22, as was an adopted budget,

190
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,104
the operating budget was 58 million.

191
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,840
And then the restricted budget,

192
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,744
we looked at 9.5. And with

193
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,216
a total budget for FY 22, which was

194
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:09,116
adopted at 67.2 million.

195
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:13,740
And then moving from FY 22 adopted budget to the FY 22

196
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,116
current change, we had the following adjustments made.

197
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:21,504
We had an restricted account and adjustments for 58

198
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:25,712
million. And then we had hope adjustments that went to 726,000.

199
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:29,244
And then healthcare

200
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:32,516
benefits. As far as active civilians, there was a

201
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:34,950
reduction actually of 103,000,

202
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,936
council surplus,

203
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:41,552
98,000. And then the zoo contract

204
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:45,348
in terms of annual payment, 10.5 million.

205
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:49,272
So after combining those adjustments, there was 11.3

206
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:52,584
million. And we got to our FY 22 current

207
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:55,370
budget of 78.6 million.

208
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,230
Next slide, please.

209
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,504
Moving from FY 22, our current budget

210
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:07,048
to FY 23, we made the following budget adjustments.

211
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:11,148
You look at health care benefits for civilians and long term disability,

212
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:15,900
310,000. FY 22 Hope Allowances,

213
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,464
we look at 251,023.

214
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:21,620
Hope allowance.

215
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,984
960,000. Minimum wage adjustments,

216
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:30,000
149,000. Municipal pension,

217
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,200
224. As far as a reduction,

218
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,324
so that was good news. You look at restricted accounts

219
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:42,180
at 221,000, and then the Zoo CIP

220
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:50,636
increase at 520,000.

221
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:54,444
All right, we have new facility allowance. This is the A leaf, bringing that

222
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:55,980
on at 588,000.

223
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,740
And then I love our park initiatives

224
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,116
that's been so beneficial to neighborhoods,

225
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:06,732
about 5 million. So we get to the FY

226
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:11,010
23 proposed budget of 86.6 million,

227
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,172
which is a 10.3% increase for the current

228
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:17,750
budget. Next slide, please.

229
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,756
We look at expenditures from 23. In terms of expenditure

230
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:27,128
highlights, we had some variances between

231
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:31,320
FY 23 and FY 22 budget.

232
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,696
All of the increases were due to Hope allowances,

233
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:38,700
minimum wage adjustments, and related benefits.

234
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,780
So explaining this by fund, you look at 1000,

235
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,748
our General fund. There's an $8 million difference.

236
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:50,112
This increase is in restricted accounts and

237
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,632
funding for the Mayor's Love Our Parks Initiative Fund,

238
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,312
2100. Special revenue is 274,000.

239
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:00,840
And this is a purchase

240
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,560
of sports fill vehicles to maintain our fields

241
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,100
and our inventory for Fields fund 21

242
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:14,040
four. As far as golf revenue, it's 894,000

243
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,336
for increased maintenance costs and upgrades to

244
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:20,584
the course. To ensure that we meet

245
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:24,040
the PGA standard to deliver the tournament

246
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,430
here in Houston, we have our maintenance renewal and replacement of 343,000.

247
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,904
This is due to an increase in maintenance and park maintenance and repair

248
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,830
cost. You look at fund 21 six,

249
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,728
greenway, greenways, 2020 of 34,000.

250
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:47,280
This is mainly the purchase of new vehicles and equipment.

251
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,044
This actually concludes our budget presentation. I went

252
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:56,724
through it pretty quick. You guys may have questions. We also have

253
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:00,436
some department demographics and accomplishments in the

254
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:04,244
appendix in the back. I like to open this

255
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:08,072
up for questions. I want to thank my team for certainly joining me.

256
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:11,530
That's behind me. Thank you.

257
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,016
Thank you. We have a couple of council members in queue. We'll start off with

258
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:16,700
council member Abby Cayman.

259
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,830
Thank you so much, Director. And the entire team.

260
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,184
Really quickly, on page 16, the health benefit adjustment,

261
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:31,296
the 103. Can you just explain a

262
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,610
little bit more on that?

263
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,414
Health benefits for active civilians in terms of the reduction

264
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:44,494
of 203 I'm sorry,

265
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:46,240
$103,000.

266
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,360
Could you elaborate on that for me, please? Yeah, it's mostly due to

267
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,230
when we look at the health benefits for the active civilians,

268
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,526
when people retire, your employees retire and we bring on new employees,

269
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:07,042
we budget them at the lowest health

270
00:18:07,096 --> 00:18:10,722
benefit rate in hopes that they're going to come in.

271
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:14,662
And so we budget for just lower than

272
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:18,162
if somebody retire after being there 32, 35 years somewhere.

273
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:21,514
Okay, understood. I wasn't sure if that was a COVID correlation or

274
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:24,620
what. It just stood out to me. Thank you.

275
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,690
While we never wanted a pandemic,

276
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,586
still wish we weren't dealing with some of it. But one of the things that

277
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:38,702
came out of it was the greater appreciation I think we have for being outside

278
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:42,734
and the services that you all provide day in and day out for

279
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:46,426
our park system and not just the enjoyment of the outdoors, but Director,

280
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,494
to your point, the support we provide for our youth through the Parks

281
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,986
program I know you talked about the Meals program. Every year I

282
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,074
bring up one of my favorite programs we do at the city is the after

283
00:18:57,112 --> 00:19:00,758
school programs, not only giving kids

284
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:04,246
a safe place to be while their parents may

285
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,134
still be at work, but the folks that work in your

286
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:11,954
department are providing tutoring crafts.

287
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:15,974
I remember one night I was at a civic club meeting at Cherryhurst,

288
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:19,242
and it had to be 1030 at night, and there was still

289
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:22,746
an employee there teaching one

290
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:25,902
of the kids how to play chess so that he could be on the school

291
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,246
team. And that dedication just

292
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:32,320
changes lives. So thank you for that really quickly.

293
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,086
Given the financial constraints that we continue to face at

294
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:40,734
the city, what are some of the needs that currently are not being

295
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:44,114
met, and is there anything you want to flag for council that may be coming

296
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:47,778
up in the future that we need to be aware of as a need that

297
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:53,526
is not sustainable right now. Based on this budget in

298
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:57,302
terms of facility renovations and

299
00:19:57,356 --> 00:20:00,486
park maintenance and reducing our

300
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:04,026
moore's cycles, we're currently on

301
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:07,962
basically a 21 day cycle for

302
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:11,574
much of the park land throughout the city. We do have some partnerships,

303
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:15,114
and we're engaged with some community groups that help us take care of

304
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:19,262
parks, but that's one of the major things. We want our parks in great

305
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:22,826
condition, but currently, because of staffing levels

306
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:26,662
and budget, we would love to reduce our mooring cycles.

307
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,100
That's number one.

308
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,420
And then two, in terms of delivering services,

309
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,162
we're limited to the amount of staff that we have at each location.

310
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:43,266
And so sometimes we're relocated to partnerships and opening

311
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:47,346
and closing doors, with our primary programming

312
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:52,118
being our after school program and then some specialty classes where we invite

313
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:55,580
other groups to come in. So we have to do a lot of that,

314
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,754
but mainly our Mourn cycles and then

315
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:03,930
support for our youth in terms of programming,

316
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,446
oh, I can't forget, and he'll kill me if I walk out of here

317
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:12,542
without saying it. Our facilities in terms

318
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:16,254
of upkeep and maintenance, we have some

319
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:19,938
aging facilities. We need a lot, but we take care

320
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:22,900
of them as best we can. Thank you.

321
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,974
Like to welcome council member Sally Alcorn and Council member Carolyn

322
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:30,180
Evan Chabaz to the horseshoe. Council Member Amy Pick.

323
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,834
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. And thank you, Director for the presentation director.

324
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:38,118
Has there ever been a study to see if

325
00:21:38,284 --> 00:21:41,894
for the Mowing of the Esplanades and the libraries and multi service centers,

326
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:45,222
if working with Public Works to leverage funds

327
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:48,780
or contracts, that kind of thing, would save any money?

328
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,650
We certainly encourage collaborations

329
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,670
and working together with other city departments,

330
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,582
the Esplanades are very

331
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:04,974
intense. We get to them like

332
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:08,690
a third priority after we mow the parks

333
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,686
and after we take care of other business. But that's

334
00:22:14,718 --> 00:22:18,100
a critical area because we want them to look as nice as everything else.

335
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,320
As far as collaborating with Public Works,

336
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,894
I think they're just as limited as we are. We do

337
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:29,734
collaborate with neighborhood groups that want to maintain. That's been our

338
00:22:29,772 --> 00:22:33,494
best way to kind of dig into the inventory

339
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:38,122
of espionage, but without partnering and us

340
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:41,834
being a solo on it. 22 to 24

341
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:45,726
days is what we are now based on resources. So we

342
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:49,114
welcome collaboration with any department or neighborhood

343
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:51,840
group to help us eat into that. Thank you.

344
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,622
Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you.

345
00:22:56,676 --> 00:23:00,286
Along those same lines, on the performance measures in the budget

346
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:03,966
book, you have actually a target of 27 days on the mowing

347
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:07,314
cycle. And just back a couple of years ago, it was 21.

348
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:11,006
And those six days make a heck of a lot of difference. So I'm

349
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,526
also interested in, and I'm trying to find in

350
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:18,806
the raw data, where can I find the

351
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:21,990
mowing dollars? I mean, you have a landscape and

352
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,674
gardening. Do you remember the name of how you

353
00:23:25,712 --> 00:23:28,646
classify mowing? It's not listed as mowing.

354
00:23:28,838 --> 00:23:32,138
Okay, you can get that to me later. We can get that

355
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:35,822
specific. And on the health benefits question that Council member Cayman asked,

356
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:40,126
I mean, I see consistently across all departments a

357
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:43,930
big savings in health benefits. It's consistently

358
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,774
over the years. And this is a 400 million plus expense

359
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:49,060
we do every year.

360
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,718
I know we want to have enough money for health benefits always, but we're overdoing

361
00:23:56,734 --> 00:24:00,434
it by quite a bit, and then those savings are passed back to

362
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,826
the department. So that $103,000 is just because we're

363
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:07,686
overstating what we think we're going to need on health benefits. And I've seen that

364
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:10,870
kind of across the board on that. Okay?

365
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,030
That's all I have. If you could just get the exact mowing costs,

366
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,954
I'd like to see that. And are they broken out by parks and

367
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:22,234
libraries and Esplanades, or is it just

368
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,882
kind of one? It's actually

369
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:29,166
in one. So green space management. So if you look at

370
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:32,430
the green space management budget, that's where you have it.

371
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,710
So we don't have really anything broken down. Now, some of them have

372
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,106
individual call centers, but not all parks have. Okay, so just

373
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:42,926
in the green space management. And one thing I know we've talked to the city's

374
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:47,230
naturalist about, and thanks to Barbara Quattro,

375
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,458
in a leaf, she has brought up the linear forests,

376
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:55,286
putting more trees in the Esplanades so the grass isn't growing so high.

377
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:59,554
Also using more, we've had a big meeting with the natural

378
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:03,146
plantings in the esplanades, which don't require as

379
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,142
much mowing. So what is the department doing to further

380
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:10,742
those initiatives? One thing, in terms of partnerships

381
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:14,134
with neighborhoods and community groups, we have several

382
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:17,458
of our Espanas that are maintained by neighborhoods.

383
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:20,526
So that definitely help. They have to do it

384
00:25:20,548 --> 00:25:24,426
by park standard, of course, in terms of what you're planning and how you're

385
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:27,522
maintaining. But that's been great over the years,

386
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:31,154
and we hope to enhance that effort. Thank you,

387
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:34,546
Council Member Robert Gallegos. Thank you,

388
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:37,730
Chair. Talking about the esplanades as well.

389
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,106
First of all, I think you all do a pretty good job with the number

390
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:44,022
of esplanades you have in the city of Houston to try to keep all them

391
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:48,066
maintained. But there are two or three esplanades

392
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:51,574
over there by Gulf Gate. I know that the Pecan Park Civic Club

393
00:25:51,622 --> 00:25:55,434
has complained, and I believe it's because

394
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:59,402
the esplanades are all concrete, but the cracks have

395
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:02,170
grass that's growing that's like 2ft tall.

396
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,118
So the civic club,

397
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:09,886
PECOM Park has complained about that. So I'm hoping that

398
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:13,722
can be addressed where they can go out. And again, I know they don't

399
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:17,390
go out there regularly due to the fact that they're concreted over.

400
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,522
It's not dirty and grass or what have you, but in between

401
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:25,234
the cracks, the grass does grow and the grass kid you not.

402
00:26:25,272 --> 00:26:28,606
It's like 2ft tall. So if that can be addressed,

403
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:32,198
it'd be great. Also, in regards to the golf special

404
00:26:32,284 --> 00:26:35,350
revenue fund or the golf expenses,

405
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,914
I know that the Houston Golf Association

406
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:42,520
took over Gus Worthham golf Course. It's still a city golf course,

407
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:47,450
and this course was done back under the previous administration.

408
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,226
And what I thought it was like a trial basis to see if

409
00:26:51,248 --> 00:26:55,310
they would be successful, and I think they've proven that they are successful.

410
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,642
Is there still discussion of maybe the Houston Golf Association

411
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:03,486
of taking over other city golf courses, even though it

412
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:06,754
will be city land, city property, but they would

413
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,954
just maintain it and manage it and what have you?

414
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:13,682
No current discussion as far as golf association taking

415
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:17,106
over golf courses with our involvement with

416
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:21,186
the Astros Golf Foundation and the Astros

417
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:25,554
primarily at Memorial Golf is doing great right now in terms of revenue.

418
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:30,114
A lot of people are planning. We're able to maintain the courses appropriately,

419
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:33,882
and then we do have Herman that's coming up pretty

420
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:38,394
soon in terms of consideration of operating in

421
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:41,706
November. So that may

422
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:45,386
be on the table soon. Okay, you put me back in. We'll put

423
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:48,986
you back. Include in queue council member Tasha Jackson.

424
00:27:49,178 --> 00:27:52,286
Thank you. And thank you, Director Allen, for your presentation and

425
00:27:52,308 --> 00:27:56,014
just all your work that you've been doing and working with my office on

426
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:59,294
trying to get our parks. Just understand where

427
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:02,658
we're going with the parks and the need. And I know we've done a lot

428
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:06,686
of tours over the past two months, the parks in my district.

429
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,614
And just talking to your staff, one of the things is we needed more staff.

430
00:28:09,662 --> 00:28:14,066
You need more staff to cover some of the maintenance that's

431
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:17,734
needed within the parks. And so I'm just curious. I see that there's an

432
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:21,094
increase of 10.3%. We have the

433
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,662
love our parks initiative. So is the extra staff and the 5 million

434
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:28,406
that's in the Love Our Parks, or have you included additional staff?

435
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:31,434
I know our conversation was I know we need money, so we need to ask

436
00:28:31,472 --> 00:28:35,730
for what we need. I just want to make sure that we're

437
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,034
aligned. And so is the additional staff in this budget.

438
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:42,810
No additional staff, but just resources

439
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,638
and material to get that type of work done and then

440
00:28:46,804 --> 00:28:50,386
outsourcing as we need to, especially with the Love Our

441
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:53,726
Parks initiative. As we complete those projects.

442
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:56,994
We have five more parks we're going to this fiscal year.

443
00:28:57,032 --> 00:29:01,266
We did five last year. But contracting

444
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:04,866
out has been a way to complete some of the projects

445
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:08,086
and then just the raw material that's needed for the

446
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:11,366
upgrades, purchasing that. So one of the

447
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:14,902
ways I operate is I do, like, a pento budget and

448
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:18,666
like a Bentley budget. Like, what is your Bentley budget? Because I'm sure this is

449
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:22,326
a pento budget. What is it that you actually need? I know my colleague

450
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:26,138
asks those questions. What do you need to actually give the community

451
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:29,838
what they need? And that's parks that's functionable that they can use.

452
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:32,926
And so, of course, we've seen the parks in my district, and I know my

453
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:36,898
other colleagues have visited the parks. And so what is it that you actually need

454
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:40,580
to do your job? That's a load of questions for me.

455
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,878
With Houston being the fourth largest city in a nation,

456
00:29:45,054 --> 00:29:49,346
we cover a lot of territory for

457
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:53,506
us to get to 14 days or seven day mourning

458
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:56,966
cycle. It's going to take a tremendous amount of money for

459
00:29:56,988 --> 00:30:00,470
us to get there. And then facility upgrades. When you think about

460
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,598
we have agent facilities, agent pools, it's immense.

461
00:30:04,774 --> 00:30:08,140
I'll have to do a study or some type of

462
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,154
document that would assess all of our

463
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:15,786
facilities and then our programs, as well as things that

464
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,278
we need to upgrade. But I'll need a little time to

465
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:23,038
get that together for you. I don't want to just throw out a number,

466
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:26,366
and it's not nearly what

467
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:30,106
I need to tell you, but it's extensive. I will say that. Okay. And I'm

468
00:30:30,138 --> 00:30:32,706
still waiting on my list from the parks that we tour so I can get

469
00:30:32,728 --> 00:30:36,498
that dollar amount based upon what the community said that they

470
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:38,674
would like to see in the park. And that way we can know what we

471
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,520
need, and then we can advocate for those resources. And thank you. You're welcome.

472
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,930
Council Member David Robinson. Thank you, chair and director.

473
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,438
Thanks for everything you do with the limited budget I think some of

474
00:30:50,444 --> 00:30:55,066
the comments we're hearing from around the horseshoe just really underline how

475
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:58,906
you do so much with so little. And while we're talking about

476
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:03,146
things related to the request my council colleague just made,

477
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:07,280
time and money and personnel would solve a lot of problems.

478
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,342
So recognizing all that, I think you're coming

479
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:14,862
here with your presentation on the heels of the discussion with the General

480
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:18,562
Services Department. And some of what we spoke about already today

481
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:21,890
was deferred maintenance. And as an observation,

482
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,542
when one doesn't mow the esplanade,

483
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:29,300
that deferred maintenance becomes very obvious.

484
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,414
Witness my colleague, council Member Gallegos, with the problems down

485
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:36,822
by Gulf Gate and hear the things that we're saying around

486
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:40,626
town. So you hear from us all the time. In recognizing

487
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:44,742
that, I want to appreciate what you're doing with limited

488
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:48,410
dollars and all those special revenue funds and special

489
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,234
projects that are piled one on top of the other.

490
00:31:52,352 --> 00:31:56,046
With our fast and wonderfully positive changing City

491
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:59,630
Mayor Turner's Parks initiative,

492
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:04,046
what we've done recently with celebrating the Zoo, some of

493
00:32:04,068 --> 00:32:07,422
our Bayou Greenways initiatives, of course, and with

494
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:11,074
the golf program, to name a few. I want to focus on

495
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:14,350
some of what we've described already today as master

496
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,794
planning initiatives, whether that's the parks master plan,

497
00:32:17,912 --> 00:32:21,486
whether that's a master plan for tennis, which I appreciate.

498
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:25,526
You've got a section in the appendix about other accomplishments where

499
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:29,478
you talk about as you know, what we've been working on with the tennis program,

500
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:33,526
and I just wondered if you can give a little narrative

501
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:36,954
overtone of how you see things

502
00:32:37,152 --> 00:32:40,714
in that master planning category of

503
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:44,614
our parks facilities. Because those, famously, as the Adage

504
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:48,954
goes, a master plan tends to get on a shelf and collect dust.

505
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:52,302
But what can we do to help you push forward?

506
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:55,806
Specifically, in my case, curious about tennis, but what can

507
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:58,260
we do as a council to support your good work?

508
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,274
That's a great question, because when you think about the history of our

509
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:05,710
park system, we've been through several different master

510
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,634
plans and initiatives moving forward.

511
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:12,838
I think collectively, if we look at all the directors in

512
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:16,870
the other departments, one in Planning, of course, one with GSD

513
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,726
Public Works, we're currently working together for the Love Our

514
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:24,134
Parks initiative in several different areas.

515
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:28,246
So from a citywide perspective, we look internally

516
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:31,754
what we can do together for improvements. And then from

517
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:35,358
a more broad perspective, we look at

518
00:33:35,364 --> 00:33:38,478
our partners, partners like Houston Parks Board,

519
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:42,286
partners like the Buffalo Bayo Partnership, all of

520
00:33:42,308 --> 00:33:46,090
our partners, and then we look I think we have to look extensively

521
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,210
past and beyond what we could do internally. And then

522
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,110
from a study standpoint, we do our needs assessment,

523
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,266
evaluate that, and then we just come together and figure out

524
00:33:57,288 --> 00:34:01,240
where the gaps are, and we redevelop the Parks master plan.

525
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,454
I think our last plan was 2016,

526
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:07,894
and we're currently trying to get to the point

527
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:11,900
where we update that by 2024

528
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,382
for our accreditation through NRPA.

529
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:20,154
We need a solid master plan to

530
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:23,626
present to receive our accreditation. So we'll be working on

531
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:27,646
that aggressively in the next year. And the tennis program will

532
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:31,200
be part of that, sir? Absolutely. Tennis has taken

533
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,094
a unique, I would say, position right

534
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:40,330
now because we invited prose consultant

535
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,746
a few years ago to come in and do kind of a study on where

536
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:47,166
we are and where we need to go. We have a draft document that we're

537
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:50,478
tweaking now that we'll unleash with the help of zena

538
00:34:50,494 --> 00:34:53,890
Garrison who we hired as our tennis manager.

539
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:57,506
There it is. Can you say that again out loud? There's the first time I've

540
00:34:57,538 --> 00:35:01,026
heard that. Zena Garrison we hired as our outreach

541
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:04,406
and our manager for tennis. So she's

542
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:07,686
coordinating with our new deputy assistant director,

543
00:35:07,718 --> 00:35:11,514
tom Angelos, who is in the room. We're going to work together

544
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:14,300
on that plan and finalize it,

545
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,558
which will also encompensate our master plan that we have to

546
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:22,362
produce and submit

547
00:35:22,426 --> 00:35:25,342
to receive our accreditation by 24, I believe.

548
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:29,486
Is that the right date? Yeah. Amazing. Well, you said Zena Garrison.

549
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:32,786
I'm excited about that. Thank you for mentioning it. The other two words to say

550
00:35:32,808 --> 00:35:36,610
I think I just heard council member alcorn say it. Pickleball.

551
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,860
Yeah.

552
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,750
I'm going to challenge you all to try pickleball.

553
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:51,030
We're planning on using the sport of pickleball.

554
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,930
It's similar to tennis, and we're going to actually

555
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,834
provide an opportunity for the public to play. We hope

556
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,874
to establish about 30 courts throughout Houston combined

557
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:06,750
with tennis. It's a unique sport.

558
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,470
It's fast paced. There are several different division.

559
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,374
Tom Angelos are newly hired. Well, he's been on for

560
00:36:15,412 --> 00:36:19,214
almost a year now. He's a pickleball advocate.

561
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:23,842
And we're promoting not only developing courts with

562
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:27,074
tennis, but also programming along the way.

563
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:30,962
We're hosting the national pickleball tournament in

564
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:34,626
October at memorial park. So when we get closer

565
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:36,566
to that date, I would love for you guys to come out and take a

566
00:36:36,588 --> 00:36:40,706
look at it. Absolutely. Thanks again, director, you vice

567
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:43,274
mayor pro TEM Martha castex Tatum. Thank you,

568
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:47,430
chair director Allen, thank you so much for your presentation.

569
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:52,330
I heard you say that esplanades were the third priority

570
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,914
after the parks and some other services and then our esplanades.

571
00:36:56,982 --> 00:37:00,538
I was driving home on yesterday along Kirby.

572
00:37:00,714 --> 00:37:04,266
I usually go on 59, but I went down Kirby because the freeway is closed

573
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:08,082
at 610 and I saw a group of contractors putting

574
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:11,394
down turf in the esplanade, and I thought

575
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:15,010
that was a genius idea. So my question is,

576
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,006
what's your thoughts on turf in the esplanades?

577
00:37:19,118 --> 00:37:23,314
And I noticed that along that Kirby street

578
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:26,994
headed towards holcomb, there are lots of trees, so the grass

579
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:30,674
doesn't grow there. So I know they were putting that artificial

580
00:37:30,722 --> 00:37:34,502
turf down because they can't get the grass to grow there. But it looked

581
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:37,866
amazing. I said I was going to go back down that way today to

582
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:41,338
see what the. Finished product looked like, but there was a whole crew there,

583
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:45,566
and they were putting down turf in the esplanade. I'm interested

584
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:49,120
to know your thoughts on that, because if that's a thing,

585
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,706
I'd be interested in having some artificial turf

586
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,920
and some espionage in District A.

587
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,354
That's a pretty amazing idea. We have some wonderful partnerships with

588
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:04,034
neighborhoods in terms of taking care of their

589
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:07,646
espinates. It's called the adopt Espinate

590
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:11,122
program. And so there's some great ideas. Turf is very

591
00:38:11,176 --> 00:38:14,594
expensive to put down up front, but you don't have to maintain

592
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:17,686
it. So I like to explore that idea even more.

593
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:20,966
I'll go by there today and take a picture of the finished product and send

594
00:38:20,988 --> 00:38:24,522
it to you, and we can explore that a little more. I'll appreciate it.

595
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:27,770
All right. Council Member Carolyn Evans Shabaz.

596
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,234
Thank you, Mayor Pro. Tim. Thank you so much. Director Allen.

597
00:38:34,282 --> 00:38:38,026
We've had a lot of engagement about our park

598
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:41,038
rich, District D. I wanted to ask,

599
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:44,480
how often are the esplanades cut?

600
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:48,366
I just got a call, and they're saying that they think they need

601
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:52,242
to be cut every two weeks. I don't know what kind of cycle they are

602
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,650
on, and maybe it depends on where they're located.

603
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,146
We're actually on a 28 day cycle for espionage, but I

604
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:03,710
think every two weeks is a little much to be

605
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,882
able to maintain for a full city. So I was just curious.

606
00:39:06,946 --> 00:39:10,278
So it's a 28 day cycle, at least 28 days. But many of

607
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:14,182
our espionage are adopted by civic clubs and neighborhood

608
00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:17,894
groups, and so that's been great. In some areas.

609
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,898
It's kind of like having a garden and having volunteers kind

610
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:25,514
of maintain it. We do have standards, and there's a process for

611
00:39:25,552 --> 00:39:29,134
adopting an espinate. I encourage communities to get

612
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:32,746
involved with that. It's certainly a way to keep neighborhoods

613
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:36,350
beautified. In terms of volunteerism,

614
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,058
my last question, how do the sectors factor in to

615
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:44,546
money? Because I know that we have a lot of parks, but we

616
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:47,490
don't get as much money in regards to the sectors.

617
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,066
The park sectors are specific to the development

618
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:56,006
that's happening in those sectors, and monies are allotted to

619
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:59,282
that specific sector. I've had recent conversations

620
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:03,414
with legal about how we can possibly

621
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:07,258
even the playing field in terms of

622
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:11,066
money and development throughout this city. We are looking at

623
00:40:11,088 --> 00:40:14,618
some potential options that we could get into in

624
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:17,742
terms of sharing in the future. But I don't have a document for you guys

625
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:21,166
just yet, but we're looking into that. Okay, thank you very much.

626
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:24,350
Thank you. Council Member Mary NAN Huffman.

627
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,894
Thank you, Director, for everything that you do. How many escalades are adopted,

628
00:40:28,942 --> 00:40:29,860
do you know?

629
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,290
Mr. Gonzalez?

630
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,922
About 1000 acres. Okay. And you've talked about the program,

631
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,880
the Adopt an Esplanade program,

632
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,894
but I don't see a lot of advertising for it. What do we do to

633
00:40:47,932 --> 00:40:52,054
encourage civic associations and homeowners associations to engage

634
00:40:52,102 --> 00:40:56,250
in that program? Oh, definitely, if you guys have newsletters,

635
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,660
put them in your newsletters online,

636
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,654
and we can develop a campaign to actually assist

637
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:07,498
with that from our communications office. But I think it's

638
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:10,574
a great idea to get more exposure toward that program.

639
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:14,778
And then also, if one esplanade is adopted,

640
00:41:14,954 --> 00:41:17,906
what does that equal in savings for the city?

641
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:20,340
Or is it by acre? Oh,

642
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,682
our expense per acre is about mr.

643
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:34,198
Gonzalez 2828

644
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:37,458
$2800 per acre.

645
00:41:37,554 --> 00:41:40,898
Thank you. Council Member Robert

646
00:41:40,914 --> 00:41:44,486
Gallegos. Thank you, Mayor, for Tim.

647
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:48,346
Director, in regards to I know there's a y'all are in

648
00:41:48,368 --> 00:41:52,086
need of lifeguards. I am so glad you brought

649
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:55,966
that up. Are we we

650
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:59,822
have 37 pools throughout this city, and I would love

651
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:04,080
to open all of them. You guys know last year we only opened ten.

652
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,042
This year, we're scheduled to do just about

653
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:12,546
that. Again, there's just a shortage. We don't have

654
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:15,922
the same amount

655
00:42:15,976 --> 00:42:19,670
of young men and women coming out to lifeguard.

656
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,470
They're choosing other things. Our workforce used to be about

657
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,310
50% return, but after we closed pools,

658
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:32,346
we lost that workforce, and we're aggressively trying to

659
00:42:32,368 --> 00:42:36,954
regain it. But for a young

660
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:39,050
adult starting at 16,

661
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,314
we have opportunities anywhere from a pool supervisor to

662
00:42:44,352 --> 00:42:48,154
a head lifeguard and a lifeguard. And we take this profession

663
00:42:48,282 --> 00:42:51,934
very seriously because you're responsible for lives in that

664
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:55,326
pool. We want to operate safely, and we want to make

665
00:42:55,348 --> 00:42:58,866
sure we have everything we need at each location. So if

666
00:42:58,888 --> 00:43:02,466
we were to open a day, it would be about ten or

667
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:06,210
eleven pools. We're aggressively recruiting and asking

668
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,130
for help so that we can open more.

669
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,734
And we'll do that from a strategic standpoint. In terms

670
00:43:13,772 --> 00:43:17,522
of attendance in the past, we may go to a rotating

671
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:21,106
schedule. Two pools open on this side of town

672
00:43:21,138 --> 00:43:24,166
or in this district, and then maybe Tuesday,

673
00:43:24,278 --> 00:43:28,054
Thursday, and then two on another side, maybe Wednesday,

674
00:43:28,102 --> 00:43:31,466
Friday. But we have to get creative in providing these services

675
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:35,254
across the city with what we have in terms of staffing resources.

676
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:38,926
But we're aggressively recruiting right now, and I'm hoping you reach

677
00:43:38,948 --> 00:43:42,126
out to the District council members so that way we can have input as to

678
00:43:42,148 --> 00:43:45,466
what pools we think should be opened. I know Clinton Park

679
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:49,534
has already reached out to me, and there's no other pool in the area,

680
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:53,186
so I think Clinton Park would be a great pool to open in

681
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:56,420
District I. And my last question here,

682
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:01,798
looking at the demographic breakdown again,

683
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:06,742
with nearly half the population being Hispanic, only 29% are

684
00:44:06,796 --> 00:44:09,970
employed by the Parks Department are Hispanic.

685
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,322
So I'm hoping that there can be some improvement on that.

686
00:44:13,456 --> 00:44:16,682
And if you could also please provide me with a breakdown of the

687
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:20,954
demographic breakdown for the management of

688
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,506
the Parks Department, I would appreciate it. Thank you.

689
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,486
Certainly. Council member Abby Cayman. Thank you,

690
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:31,006
Mayor. Pro TEM. Really quickly, director, one thing that's been

691
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:34,862
on my mind here in Houston we talk a lot about flooding, as we should,

692
00:44:34,996 --> 00:44:38,850
but we also have cyclical droughts.

693
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,814
87% of the state right now, and I think over half of Houston

694
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:47,090
itself is actually in a drought. Are those

695
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,046
costs calculated in, or how much more

696
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:55,320
cost is it when we're dealing with a drought? So having to water more?

697
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,830
Again, 2011 cost millions of dollars

698
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,626
in Memorial Park alone from the loss of trees. So if

699
00:45:03,648 --> 00:45:07,370
you could just speak to that really quickly in terms of that cost calculation.

700
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:11,786
As far as the cost breakdown, I don't have any history

701
00:45:11,968 --> 00:45:15,790
from previous droughts. I just know we had to recover.

702
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,434
We had to do specific things in terms of soil,

703
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:22,122
in terms of plants, in terms of placement,

704
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:26,014
but I don't have any data that could

705
00:45:26,052 --> 00:45:29,986
support it at this point. I could certainly do a

706
00:45:30,008 --> 00:45:33,714
little bit of research with our green space team and get you

707
00:45:33,752 --> 00:45:36,930
something specific, no problem. And then lastly,

708
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,094
council member Robinson, I think me and director Allen could

709
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:44,598
definitely take you and council member Alcorn on in a

710
00:45:44,604 --> 00:45:47,814
doubles with pickleball. So let us know whenever you want.

711
00:45:47,932 --> 00:45:50,840
We'll be there. What time is session over with?

712
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,410
Thank you. Anytime you guys would like to, just let me know.

713
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,786
We have five public speakers. Before that, I'd like to go to

714
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:03,766
slide eight that's on the list. And it's about Memorial Park Golf

715
00:46:03,798 --> 00:46:07,706
Course. I had the opportunity to play Saturday. I went there for

716
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:10,926
the beginning of the first tea event they had over there. And I just

717
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:15,502
wanted to highlight we get 1.1 million $333,000

718
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:18,766
as a gift from the Astros Foundation. I love the fact

719
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:22,594
that you all aerated and put some sand all over the course. And we

720
00:46:22,632 --> 00:46:26,542
really need to have that course, as you know, in great shape in November

721
00:46:26,606 --> 00:46:29,906
for the tournament, because if you remember last year,

722
00:46:29,928 --> 00:46:33,158
it wasn't in good shape. And there was a quote in a Sunday paper

723
00:46:33,244 --> 00:46:36,502
that when we all picked it up and reread it, we were embarrassed by it,

724
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:40,534
and that was the winner of the tournament. Jason Cocrot was quoted as

725
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:44,418
saying, I would have shot seven shots better if I

726
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:48,486
wasn't hitting off of mud all day. So as Memorial Park

727
00:46:48,518 --> 00:46:52,586
golf Course, so goes the rest of the golf courses in the city because we

728
00:46:52,608 --> 00:46:56,634
use the proceeds and we fund a lot of our operations with that. So I

729
00:46:56,672 --> 00:47:00,042
see a lot of good work out there. So thank you for that. Director.

730
00:47:00,186 --> 00:47:03,360
One thing that I did talk to Ms. Julie Blum about is

731
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,562
summer jobs program. Texas A and M has a great golf turf

732
00:47:07,626 --> 00:47:11,026
management school. Have we reached out to them, or does

733
00:47:11,048 --> 00:47:14,274
it make sense that we do reach out to them and try and get

734
00:47:14,312 --> 00:47:17,934
some of those young kids that are studying turf

735
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:21,910
grass science and come to Memorial and spend a summer?

736
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:26,562
It look good on their resume that they worked on a PGA tournament

737
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:30,870
golf course. And I think we have hard time attracting

738
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,726
employees out there right now because we just don't,

739
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:38,586
quite frankly, pay enough. And they get other opportunities at

740
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:42,166
other golf courses all around the city. So we're disadvantaged

741
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:45,646
right there. But using some of those Texas A and M kids, I think

742
00:47:45,668 --> 00:47:49,886
would make a good sense to get that course ready, because the

743
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:53,406
growing season is upon us, and if we don't have

744
00:47:53,428 --> 00:47:56,830
it ready in November, the Houston Open

745
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,558
will not be at Memorial Park. Again, my opinion

746
00:48:00,654 --> 00:48:04,226
and many other people's opinions. So we're doing a great job of trying to get

747
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:08,146
it there, but I want to raise that warning flag and say we

748
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:11,906
have to nail it in November. If we do nail

749
00:48:11,938 --> 00:48:15,094
it, we get an opportunity, a golden opportunity, to move

750
00:48:15,132 --> 00:48:17,970
it to April. And what happens in April,

751
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,986
we don't compete against football. We don't compete against basketball,

752
00:48:22,098 --> 00:48:25,738
and we don't compete against baseball. And our attendance numbers

753
00:48:25,824 --> 00:48:29,274
will zoom, and the higher they go, the more money we will

754
00:48:29,312 --> 00:48:33,242
receive from the Astros Golf Foundation. So any

755
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:36,958
comments on that? Last year was

756
00:48:37,044 --> 00:48:40,922
unfortunate in terms of some of the results of maintenance

757
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:44,654
of the course, I believe we made those adjustments to

758
00:48:44,692 --> 00:48:48,094
move forward. We're currently looking for a senior

759
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:52,030
superintendent that we're working with, the Astros Golf

760
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:55,794
Foundation as well as a PGA. I think

761
00:48:55,832 --> 00:49:00,146
we have qualified and great staff there. Now in

762
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:03,766
terms of maintenance of the course, we won't have the issues that

763
00:49:03,788 --> 00:49:07,190
we had last year with the Greens and their approach shots.

764
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,886
Major focus. If you see the Agronomy plan that

765
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:14,514
we're working on now, you can already see improvements.

766
00:49:14,642 --> 00:49:17,898
So I'm confident that we will meet the standard that we need to

767
00:49:17,904 --> 00:49:20,982
meet this year because we're making adjustments

768
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:24,486
accordingly, and I know you will. So thank you for that. Council Member Carolyn

769
00:49:24,518 --> 00:49:28,126
Evan Shabaz. Thank you, Mayor. For.

770
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:31,086
Tim and I did want to take this time to tell you thank you as

771
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:34,494
well. We had our first Te graduation on this

772
00:49:34,532 --> 00:49:38,386
past Saturday. It was great. We had 16 students

773
00:49:38,488 --> 00:49:41,666
that participated in a program for a few weeks,

774
00:49:41,768 --> 00:49:45,458
and you were the impetus for that idea, you and

775
00:49:45,544 --> 00:49:49,362
Steven, my constituents director. The young people

776
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:52,642
really enjoyed it, and more importantly, they have opportunities

777
00:49:52,786 --> 00:49:56,226
to maintain the game and perhaps get scholarships.

778
00:49:56,338 --> 00:50:00,038
And so that's so very important. So I wanted to make sure that I did

779
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:03,800
thank you for that. Thank you. We have

780
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,878
five public speakers. Same rules apply for this session as last. First we'll

781
00:50:07,894 --> 00:50:11,814
have Miss Saba blinding Director.

782
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,680
Thank you for your comments, and I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

783
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:22,206
Hello. Good morning. First. Before I forget, I wanted to

784
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:26,042
follow on Council member Alcorn and Council member Cayman's comments

785
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:29,646
about drought. And I love the idea of putting some more native grasses

786
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:33,780
and native plants in our esplanades, in our cross just to

787
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,474
help. And also,

788
00:50:37,592 --> 00:50:40,754
I wanted to speak on behalf of my ten year old, who could not be

789
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:44,166
here this morning due to testing. She would love to

790
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:47,494
see more skate parks in the city of Houston. She is a great

791
00:50:47,532 --> 00:50:50,726
fan of the Lee and Joe Jamel skate park as well as the

792
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:54,630
lessons you offer through them. And she also shared a desire for more gardens

793
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,726
like the McGovern Centennial Gardens. She also asked about sidebalks

794
00:50:58,758 --> 00:51:01,050
and I told her that was a whole nother bag.

795
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:06,174
And just as a mom, I cannot say enough

796
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:10,970
good things about the Parks Department. I frequently have conversations with other parents

797
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:14,798
discussing both of our love for Houston parks programming and

798
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:18,160
a desire for more as they quickly fill up once open to the public.

799
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:23,102
Just a quick anecdote. A friend of mine once shared the long list of incredible

800
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,514
Houston camps his sons attended and that of

801
00:51:26,552 --> 00:51:29,854
all of them, the Cherryhurst camp through the Parks Department was their favorite.

802
00:51:29,902 --> 00:51:32,422
And they liked it so much that the next summer it was the only program

803
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:35,894
they signed up for. And I could say more and more about

804
00:51:35,932 --> 00:51:39,622
what parents talk about. Thank you, Ms. Blanding. Thank you. We're running

805
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:42,778
behind already. Could I just a quick question.

806
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:46,746
5 seconds. Okay, thinking citywide. What would it look like to

807
00:51:46,768 --> 00:51:50,266
expand and grow current programming equitably across the

808
00:51:50,288 --> 00:51:54,186
city? So thank you for the question and we

809
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:57,646
are directing director Allen and Ms. Johnson that we

810
00:51:57,668 --> 00:52:01,278
will field all the questions. So we will go ahead and take that.

811
00:52:01,364 --> 00:52:04,698
If anybody has any answers to Ms.

812
00:52:04,714 --> 00:52:07,742
Blanding's question on council, please feel

813
00:52:07,796 --> 00:52:11,346
free to chime in. But as a good teacher would

814
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:14,866
say, you're dismissed. I just want to know what it

815
00:52:14,888 --> 00:52:18,174
would be look like. I mean, I can't say enough good things about the programming

816
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:22,338
and so what would it look like to expand it more equitably

817
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:26,200
across the city of Houston? Getting tongue tied today.

818
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,374
I mean, funds are limited. I'll give you an example. We have no city run

819
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:33,926
parks in Kingwood, and we have one city run park in Clear Lake.

820
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:36,986
So I have one. And we

821
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:40,870
have Lake Houston Wilderness Park, which is the most underappreciated

822
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,930
park in the city, maybe in the south,

823
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:47,534
but I think that a lot of it comes

824
00:52:47,572 --> 00:52:49,120
from you all. South in the US.

825
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,838
I think a lot of it comes from you all based on the dynamics and

826
00:52:53,844 --> 00:52:56,926
the circumstances of each district, understanding what

827
00:52:56,948 --> 00:52:59,666
the needs are of each neighborhood and what you would like to see from a

828
00:52:59,688 --> 00:53:02,850
programming standpoint as well as a recreational standpoint.

829
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:07,266
And so we lean on you all to let us know as your

830
00:53:07,288 --> 00:53:10,398
council members on what you would like to see within your own footprint.

831
00:53:10,494 --> 00:53:14,102
And then we will work within ourselves, either through our council district service

832
00:53:14,156 --> 00:53:18,214
funds or directly with the Parks Department on trying to find ways

833
00:53:18,252 --> 00:53:22,006
to improve parks with those specialty needs. Yes, and if you

834
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:25,094
have any ideas, please send them to us. We will make sure that we pass

835
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:28,074
them along and then we will give them to your appropriate council member as well.

836
00:53:28,112 --> 00:53:31,642
Because as we keep talking about, we do have council district service

837
00:53:31,696 --> 00:53:34,970
funds that we can use for some of our parks

838
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:38,474
activities. I know we use some at our Sylvan Rodriguez

839
00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:41,726
Park down south. I appreciate the invitation. Yes,

840
00:53:41,748 --> 00:53:43,680
ma'am. Mr.

841
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,640
Council Member Robert Gallegos. I'm sorry.

842
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:52,530
First of all, thank you for being here. Appreciate you being here.

843
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,210
I know that Mayor Turner has the

844
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,066
50 50 parks. He's reaching out to corporations to

845
00:54:00,088 --> 00:54:03,730
hopefully put some monies in parks that have been neglected

846
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:07,474
in many of our districts. I know that at Hartman

847
00:54:07,522 --> 00:54:11,206
Park there in Manchester, we were able to get valero. That was the

848
00:54:11,228 --> 00:54:14,322
first 50 50 park. They were able to put monies for

849
00:54:14,396 --> 00:54:17,526
new play equipment because I kid you not, some of their play, the play equipment

850
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:20,906
was rusting. And a

851
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:24,170
lot of people are surprised on the cost of play equipment.

852
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,714
It was about $660,000 for

853
00:54:28,752 --> 00:54:32,378
new play equipment at at Hartman Park. So that that's what we're

854
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:35,390
running into is that the cost is just so expensive.

855
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:40,018
And I've got a request at Fondi Park last week at my

856
00:54:40,104 --> 00:54:43,806
redistricting that they're just looking for new swings.

857
00:54:43,918 --> 00:54:46,946
I asked them, do you need the whole play equipment? They said, no, we just

858
00:54:46,968 --> 00:54:50,882
need new swings. So I'm going to put in the cost to the

859
00:54:50,936 --> 00:54:54,498
parks department to see just how much do swings cost. And I'm

860
00:54:54,514 --> 00:54:58,018
afraid to hear the price tag just for swings, but I'm

861
00:54:58,034 --> 00:55:01,640
going to try to do that at Fondue Park as well.

862
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,590
Thank you, Mr. Landing. Thank you, Mr. Jason Oliver.

863
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:06,460
Thank you.

864
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,316
So I just got here late during the last presentation, but I wanted to

865
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:27,160
ask, why is council fielding our questions

866
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,344
instead of the because every committee I let it get away.

867
00:55:30,382 --> 00:55:33,576
That was my fault. I let it get away from us yesterday. That's why we

868
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:37,192
ran overtime. We're going to limit people to 1 minute like we gave instructions

869
00:55:37,256 --> 00:55:40,780
on. And in every committee meeting we have in the city of Houston,

870
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,256
questions come to council members, not to department directors.

871
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:48,844
So we're going to keep with that as elected officials.

872
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:52,480
That's on us. It's our budget process as well.

873
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,096
So we're going to go back to what I should have done yesterday and

874
00:55:56,118 --> 00:55:59,856
that was my fault. So we

875
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:03,072
won't be able to likely get the answers to our questions

876
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:06,916
or at least clear answers in time for the well, hopefully you all

877
00:56:06,938 --> 00:56:10,756
can get answers back quickly. Yes. I mean, our path is within 48 hours,

878
00:56:10,858 --> 00:56:14,296
we get the questions posted, we get the answers. And I

879
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:17,576
would invite you to talk to your respective council member and

880
00:56:17,598 --> 00:56:21,176
make sure you get those answers to those questions directed back to

881
00:56:21,198 --> 00:56:24,484
you. Okay. In the past, the parks

882
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:27,956
department has said that they can easily double you soccer participation

883
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:31,372
with just a few more staff to administer the program. Your general

884
00:56:31,426 --> 00:56:35,004
fund spend is about 200,000. Basically the same as five years ago.

885
00:56:35,122 --> 00:56:38,670
Is there an opportunity to still reach an additional 50,000 students

886
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,424
through that programming? And I also want to know how competitive lifeguard pay is.

887
00:56:43,622 --> 00:56:47,136
So I'll take our lifeguard pay. That's why

888
00:56:47,158 --> 00:56:49,852
we're having trouble right now. Is it's not competitive,

889
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:53,876
especially with some of the different swim clubs that we have around

890
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:58,084
that pay a little bit more than we do. So you

891
00:56:58,122 --> 00:57:02,004
answer your question. It's not competitive enough to answer

892
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:05,556
your question. I think it was about soccer. Yeah, a lot of the soccer

893
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:09,530
fields in the city of what's that? $11 an hour?

894
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,410
A lot of the soccer fields I'm a soccer dad. All three of my kids,

895
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,850
13 to 16, is the official answer.

896
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,684
Director Allen competitive? Correct me if I'm wrong. Your question

897
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:30,096
is about soccer fields. A lot of our soccer fields are leased to a lot

898
00:57:30,118 --> 00:57:33,772
of these soccer organizations, and we monitor the activity

899
00:57:33,836 --> 00:57:37,564
on them. So if they're leased, they actually control the soccer fields

900
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:41,496
like the Houston Golf Association controls

901
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:45,152
Gus Worthham Park. So it's up to those folks to decide.

902
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:49,220
Oh, no, my question was because the soccer program

903
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:53,030
is grant funded, and in the past they've said that

904
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,440
they could double the participation with more General Fund dollars

905
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,832
for administration. The the limitation is, is General Fund

906
00:58:01,886 --> 00:58:05,524
spend on administration, not for. So that could easily

907
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:08,764
ramp up. I'm trying to figure out if that's still the case, if we

908
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:13,260
still are kind of leaving students out when we could allocate another

909
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:17,492
quick 200,000 to really ramp up our soccer

910
00:58:17,656 --> 00:58:21,344
participation for children in Houston. Right. And thank you.

911
00:58:21,462 --> 00:58:24,640
We will post that question and get that question answered.

912
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,220
Lauren Johnson.

913
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,784
Hi. So the after school enrichment

914
00:58:42,832 --> 00:58:46,740
program currently operates at 51 community centers locations

915
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,152
throughout the Houston area, and they service about 2500

916
00:58:50,206 --> 00:58:53,370
youth with a ratio of 1.25.

917
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,736
So where is that in terms of adequate or optimal

918
00:58:57,768 --> 00:59:01,180
staffing? And how could we strategically fund that

919
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,260
expansion in the short term?

920
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,990
Anyone want to take this one on?

921
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:15,056
Okay, we will get that answer posted. And I would invite you

922
00:59:15,078 --> 00:59:19,056
to get in touch with your council member for the answer to

923
00:59:19,078 --> 00:59:22,704
that question. Once again, public speakers

924
00:59:22,752 --> 00:59:26,036
should submit their questions in writing, and then we will

925
00:59:26,058 --> 00:59:31,444
get in writing a written response back to you within 48 hours to

926
00:59:31,482 --> 00:59:34,330
your particular district council member or at large.

927
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:48,734
Joe Grochell so

928
00:59:48,772 --> 00:59:52,226
my question is, the Parks Department seems to be on par with the

929
00:59:52,248 --> 00:59:56,110
libraries in its significant community reach and impact.

930
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:59,794
And how many Houstonians do you think you are able to

931
00:59:59,832 --> 01:00:01,570
serve with every dollar?

932
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:08,646
Apparently not enough parks are I

933
01:00:08,668 --> 01:00:12,166
told you about my experience. We have no Houston parks in the area that

934
01:00:12,188 --> 01:00:16,070
I live in. We have one Houston park in the area that is Clear

935
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,446
Lake, and there's a great deal of demand.

936
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:23,354
Fortunately, we have good county parks in both of those areas that we

937
01:00:23,392 --> 01:00:27,494
partner with in many, many ways county has done a fantastic

938
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:30,894
job. My opinion of building parks in

939
01:00:30,932 --> 01:00:34,510
and around the city of Houston, in the ETJ areas,

940
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,606
the city of Houston, we struggle a little bit because of the

941
01:00:38,628 --> 01:00:42,366
lack of funds that we have available, but we do the best job that

942
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:45,954
we can given the fact that the funds are not as

943
01:00:45,992 --> 01:00:49,474
plentiful as they should be. And if anyone wants to make

944
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:53,506
a foundation donation, I would contact the great number of foundations we

945
01:00:53,528 --> 01:00:56,806
have in and around the city that are very philanthropic with

946
01:00:56,828 --> 01:01:00,662
their efforts, and contact them and adopt a neighborhood program to

947
01:01:00,716 --> 01:01:04,534
adopt a neighborhood park. We've done that in the area that I live

948
01:01:04,572 --> 01:01:07,922
in. We're responsible for the mowing of the grass,

949
01:01:08,066 --> 01:01:11,338
the new soccer equipment, and we even had a fundraiser for the

950
01:01:11,344 --> 01:01:15,034
lights that we put up. Now, not every community has

951
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:17,482
the ability to do that. I get it.

952
01:01:17,616 --> 01:01:21,510
But I think philanthropic areas of

953
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,054
funding, we have a great number of folks in and around

954
01:01:25,092 --> 01:01:28,442
this Houston area. I'll throw out the Brown

955
01:01:28,506 --> 01:01:31,630
Foundation. That has been very good to us in many regards.

956
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:38,610
Thank you. Melissa Martinez.

957
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,252
Hello. Hi. So I have a couple

958
01:01:55,306 --> 01:01:58,912
of questions. My questions about accessibility,

959
01:01:59,056 --> 01:02:02,904
such as how have the needs have changed for youth and

960
01:02:02,942 --> 01:02:06,088
elders programming during the Pandemic and also

961
01:02:06,174 --> 01:02:09,492
for our disability communities?

962
01:02:09,556 --> 01:02:13,656
And how do staff and support needed to support these equitable access to

963
01:02:13,678 --> 01:02:18,252
these programs? And also mentioned

964
01:02:18,306 --> 01:02:21,708
in slide 27 in the budget, I noticed that there was

965
01:02:21,714 --> 01:02:25,144
an investment of 14 million and improved 18 neighborhoods,

966
01:02:25,192 --> 01:02:29,016
parks, and community centers. What would the impacts be if budgets

967
01:02:29,048 --> 01:02:33,052
were to be doubled, say, like 28 million to help with these accessibility?

968
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:36,396
I think the Mayor's 50 50 initiative is right on target

969
01:02:36,428 --> 01:02:40,416
with exactly what you're doing, especially in complete communities. That's been our

970
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:44,192
emphasis. Community is only as good as the parks

971
01:02:44,256 --> 01:02:47,892
around it, and giving young people the opportunity to

972
01:02:47,946 --> 01:02:51,572
participate with funding of nice parks is

973
01:02:51,626 --> 01:02:55,288
one of the initiatives that we're front and center with what we're trying to

974
01:02:55,294 --> 01:02:58,536
do. Council Member David Robinson. Thank you. I just wanted to mention to Ms.

975
01:02:58,558 --> 01:03:02,324
Martinez that our Director of the Mayor's Office for Persons with Disabilities,

976
01:03:02,372 --> 01:03:05,656
Gabe Cassidas, recently presented to the TTI

977
01:03:05,688 --> 01:03:09,784
committee that we chair. And that presentation did talk about accessibility

978
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:13,416
generally, but also within the context

979
01:03:13,448 --> 01:03:16,812
of parks access. So you may find that posted on the city

980
01:03:16,866 --> 01:03:20,140
website under the TTI committee heading,

981
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,360
and I think you might find that helpful considering your question.

982
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:26,864
Okay. I know Director Allen. We made a lot of adjustments during

983
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:30,576
the Pandemic. We took the basketball goals down. We did

984
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,972
a lot of things. If I made the statement that we're pretty

985
01:03:34,026 --> 01:03:37,200
close to where we were pre Pandemic, is that accurate?

986
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,676
Yes. Okay. So I think you'll see more and

987
01:03:40,698 --> 01:03:44,088
more of that where, especially when the summer rolls through, hopefully we can get the

988
01:03:44,094 --> 01:03:46,520
lifeguards out. It's going to be a hot summer.

989
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:50,676
It's going to be a dry summer. It was funny

990
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:54,840
because many of us went to a Houston prayer breakfast this morning.

991
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:58,152
I know many of our officers did as well. And Mr.

992
01:03:58,206 --> 01:04:02,116
Herzog from one of the TV stations was talking about the drought and the conditions

993
01:04:02,148 --> 01:04:05,096
and how he hates it. And I was the only one that actually love a

994
01:04:05,118 --> 01:04:08,416
drought because love in a drought means we

995
01:04:08,438 --> 01:04:11,644
have no storms coming yet and we need to be prepared

996
01:04:11,692 --> 01:04:15,730
because the area that I live in was pretty devastated, as is

997
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:20,128
council member Jackson's. But Abby came and shaking her head, no, but I

998
01:04:20,134 --> 01:04:23,260
love droughts. Difference of opinion. Thank you. We will now transition.
