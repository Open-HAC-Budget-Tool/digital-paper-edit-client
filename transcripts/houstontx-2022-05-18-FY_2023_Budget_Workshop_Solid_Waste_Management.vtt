WEBVTT

00:00.170 --> 00:03.786
Presentation. And we will now move on to the budget workshop for Solid

00:03.818 --> 00:04.990
Waste Management.

00:30.310 --> 00:31.780
Okay, thank you.

00:36.950 --> 00:40.638
Good afternoon, everyone. Mark Wolffolk, Solid Waste

00:40.734 --> 00:44.202
Department. Six months in. I just wanted to put that cat out there

00:44.256 --> 00:48.186
so you all go easy on me today, all right?

00:48.368 --> 00:51.898
Also want to thank our staff for getting me to this point.

00:52.064 --> 00:55.354
I just mentioned, been here six months, but everybody's been

00:55.392 --> 00:58.638
working together. The Synergy has been great, but I

00:58.644 --> 01:02.522
just want to go ahead and throw another caveat out there on this presentation

01:02.586 --> 01:05.978
today. You're dealing with two rookies, right? So I'm

01:05.994 --> 01:09.630
here. I'm also flanked by our assistant director.

01:09.710 --> 01:12.500
How many months has it been? Two months.

01:13.430 --> 01:16.578
Two months? Yeah. Assistant director, wealthy, white.

01:16.664 --> 01:19.460
So congratulations to her.

01:20.550 --> 01:24.418
She's still hanging. Okay, so we'll go ahead and

01:24.504 --> 01:26.530
just get into the budget presentation.

01:27.930 --> 01:31.238
Apologize. I kind of broke the traditional format that

01:31.244 --> 01:34.258
you all follow, but I do want to concentrate on the budget portion.

01:34.354 --> 01:36.390
So if we could go to the next slide.

01:37.450 --> 01:41.370
I just wanted to give you all an overview of our executive leadership team here.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.794
I think the key takeaway from this slide is that we have

01:44.832 --> 01:48.046
about 427 positions in

01:48.068 --> 01:51.406
the department. And the

01:51.428 --> 01:54.926
other key takeaway from this slide is and I mentioned earlier how the team has

01:54.948 --> 01:57.946
been working with Synergy. Our deputy director,

01:57.978 --> 02:00.778
Anthony Booy, that's here today. I like to recognize him.

02:00.884 --> 02:04.834
This will be his last budget presentation. Go around with us. After 42

02:04.872 --> 02:08.306
plus years, he's getting ready to retire. So definitely like

02:08.328 --> 02:11.990
to recognize Mr. Anthony Booy for his contribution.

02:14.090 --> 02:17.734
So we've got some big shoes to fill there. So next

02:17.772 --> 02:21.510
slide, please. The demographic data.

02:21.580 --> 02:24.394
Just wanted to give you just a little quick overview of that. Of course,

02:24.432 --> 02:27.786
77% of that department is African American,

02:27.888 --> 02:29.530
followed by Hispanic,

02:30.750 --> 02:34.074
Latino, and then white and Asian. But to me,

02:34.112 --> 02:37.546
the biggest takeaway of this is the diversity, gender diversity that we

02:37.568 --> 02:41.294
have in the department and the amount of women that we have that are

02:41.332 --> 02:44.558
doing the jobs today in solid waste management. So I

02:44.564 --> 02:48.494
just really wanted to focus on that. That 29% to 30% really

02:48.532 --> 02:51.886
caught my eye when I arrived to the city. And I think there's

02:51.918 --> 02:54.450
just more good works to come. Next slide.

02:56.870 --> 03:01.086
Just why do we have to have solid waste department? For these three reasons.

03:01.118 --> 03:04.414
Right here you have the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965,

03:04.472 --> 03:07.606
as well as the Texas Health and Safety Code, and of course,

03:07.628 --> 03:11.154
the city code and ordinances. And of course, without effective

03:11.202 --> 03:15.002
solid waste management, our neighborhoods would be overrun by all

03:15.136 --> 03:18.966
types of vermin and really have deplorable conditions

03:18.998 --> 03:20.730
in the neighborhood. Next slide.

03:22.670 --> 03:26.982
You're all familiar with the forward facing departments that we have or forward facing

03:27.126 --> 03:30.702
business units that we have. So I won't spend much time there, except for on

03:30.756 --> 03:33.966
the last yellow highlighted area there.

03:34.148 --> 03:37.482
In addition to all of the services that we provide on a weekly,

03:37.626 --> 03:41.682
monthly or bimonthly basis. We also focus hard

03:41.736 --> 03:45.902
on those other support services such as homeless encampment

03:45.966 --> 03:49.218
abatement program, the litter abatement program, as well as

03:49.304 --> 03:53.094
many of the council district service funds and keeping those programs going

03:53.132 --> 03:56.470
as well. Next slide. Okay,

03:56.540 --> 04:00.390
just a functional review of our organizational chart.

04:01.290 --> 04:04.810
You'll see where basically we have three different

04:04.960 --> 04:08.310
sections in the department. It's either going to be north operations,

04:08.390 --> 04:11.894
south Operations, or Administration. And whatever doesn't

04:11.942 --> 04:16.278
fall in there will also fall under our maintenance category.

04:16.374 --> 04:20.206
But as you can see, the estimated total for this FY 23

04:20.228 --> 04:22.880
year will be about $95.6 million.

04:23.810 --> 04:27.086
All right, next slide, please. At this point, I'd like

04:27.108 --> 04:31.060
to turn this point of the presentation over to our CFO, Ms. Wealthy White.

04:33.670 --> 04:36.990
Thank you, Director. The solid waste department

04:37.070 --> 04:40.830
revenues are generated through two funds the general

04:40.920 --> 04:43.640
fund and the recycling revenue fund.

04:44.010 --> 04:47.798
The General Fund revenues includes fees from

04:47.964 --> 04:51.874
our dumpster permits, our extra capacity container

04:51.922 --> 04:55.514
program, our nonresidential garbage and our

04:55.552 --> 04:59.210
container lease fee and some other small accounts.

04:59.710 --> 05:04.390
The Recycling Revenue Fund is generated from the sale of recyclable

05:04.470 --> 05:08.058
materials like glass, scrap metal,

05:08.154 --> 05:11.760
batteries, electronics which are sold by the City.

05:12.530 --> 05:16.094
Also included in this fund are fees from our

05:16.132 --> 05:20.130
tire recycling and our business recycling programs.

05:20.470 --> 05:24.338
On this slide, we see a projected 3%

05:24.424 --> 05:27.854
increase in General Fund revenues due to the annual

05:27.902 --> 05:31.922
CPI and prior year revenue activity

05:31.986 --> 05:35.320
to be realized in fiscal year 2023.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.602
There is no projected increase in the Recycling

05:39.666 --> 05:43.254
Revenue Fund, and with these revenue funds, we have

05:43.292 --> 05:47.340
a total budget revenue budget of $14.8 million.

05:48.350 --> 05:53.046
Next slide, please. Our expenditures

05:53.158 --> 05:56.426
by funds are our department,

05:56.538 --> 06:00.670
our collection programs and other service delivery

06:02.370 --> 06:05.210
components. Includes our garbage collection,

06:05.290 --> 06:08.998
tree waste, heavy trash depositories,

06:09.194 --> 06:13.134
curbside recycling, drive through recycling

06:13.182 --> 06:16.642
facilities, sponsorships. All these

06:16.696 --> 06:20.778
areas are supported by the General Fund. And the fiscal

06:20.894 --> 06:24.854
year 2023 proposed budget is $95.6

06:24.892 --> 06:29.154
million, which represents a 1% increase

06:29.282 --> 06:31.480
from the current fiscal year.

06:32.970 --> 06:37.190
The Recycling Revenue Fund proposed expenditure

06:37.270 --> 06:40.890
supports the City's recycling programs, related services

06:41.040 --> 06:44.630
and recycling education. The proposed budget

06:44.710 --> 06:49.214
for fiscal year 2023 is $4.1 million

06:49.412 --> 06:52.974
and it represents a 5% increase from

06:53.012 --> 06:56.282
fiscal year 2022. Next slide,

06:56.346 --> 06:56.960
please.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.530
Looking at go ahead.

07:04.260 --> 07:07.124
Yeah, they're ahead. You can go ahead and explain if you can back up one

07:07.162 --> 07:10.784
slide to the pie chart. Thank you. The projected

07:10.832 --> 07:15.028
budget by fund for fiscal year 2023 in the General Fund budget,

07:15.124 --> 07:18.760
personnel represents 41% of the total budget.

07:19.180 --> 07:22.936
nonpersonal accounts for 59% of

07:22.958 --> 07:26.604
the proposed budget, and within that 59%

07:26.802 --> 07:30.344
services are 23%. And restricted

07:30.392 --> 07:34.712
accounts, supplies, non, capital transfer and debt

07:34.856 --> 07:37.390
make up the balance of 36%.

07:38.100 --> 07:41.744
In the Recycling Revenue Fund, the percentage for

07:41.782 --> 07:45.692
personnel is ten point 57 and nonpersonal

07:45.756 --> 07:49.292
is 89%. The next slide

07:49.356 --> 07:52.070
shows the net change in the General Fund.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.550
Next slide, please. Thank you.

07:56.520 --> 08:00.052
At the start of fiscal year 2022,

08:00.186 --> 08:03.992
the Solid Waste Management Department began with a budget of $89

08:04.046 --> 08:07.396
million and with adjustments throughout

08:07.428 --> 08:11.384
the year, it increased the budget to 95,

08:11.502 --> 08:15.916
601, 576. Looking forward

08:16.098 --> 08:20.120
to the fiscal year 2023 General Fund budget.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.800
Additional adjustments were made to include contractual

08:23.880 --> 08:27.732
and mandated adjustments resulting in a proposed

08:27.816 --> 08:35.810
budget of $95,610,939,

08:36.340 --> 08:40.376
which is again a net change of approximately

08:40.508 --> 08:43.700
1% from the current year's budget.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.812
Next slide. All right.

08:49.866 --> 08:53.670
Thank you, Ms. White. Now with this FY 23

08:54.440 --> 08:58.516
proposed budget, we do expect some impacts and a lot of those impacts

08:58.548 --> 09:02.376
are going to come just by growth and demand, increasing growth in

09:02.398 --> 09:05.720
demand throughout the city. We also expect

09:05.790 --> 09:09.212
some of those impacts to be attributed to the vacancy rates that we currently

09:09.266 --> 09:12.792
have that we're working on driving down overtime,

09:12.936 --> 09:17.096
as well as temporary services that we'll use to mitigate some of the shortfalls

09:17.128 --> 09:19.330
that we incur throughout the year.

09:20.980 --> 09:24.672
Operational program subsidies will be another area that we think will also

09:24.726 --> 09:28.336
impact. And that's just from observation of being here a little more

09:28.358 --> 09:31.984
than six months. Meaning that we may at times have

09:32.022 --> 09:35.972
some a need to supplement our services by calling in help

09:36.026 --> 09:39.588
from some of our private counterparts in the industry that will be

09:39.594 --> 09:43.352
in the areas of heavy trash collection which we're about to embark upon right now,

09:43.486 --> 09:46.970
as well as curbside recycling. And then

09:47.500 --> 09:51.256
again, we have challenges with addressing some of the neighborhood density projects that

09:51.278 --> 09:55.376
are going on and some of the inflationary contracts

09:55.428 --> 09:58.620
that we're seeing or inflationary impact to contracts that we're seeing today.

09:58.770 --> 09:59.820
Next slide.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.660
Okay, again, FY 22 accomplishments.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.800
There have been several that have been going on prior to my arrival

10:09.960 --> 10:13.680
and then since my arrival, they've continued to

10:13.750 --> 10:17.356
keep the momentum going. I think the biggest takeaway throughout

10:17.388 --> 10:20.764
the year has been the fact that the city has gotten aggressive and they recognize

10:20.812 --> 10:25.152
the fact that we've had a shortage in some of our key or critical

10:25.216 --> 10:29.076
positions, that being the driving positions. And the

10:29.178 --> 10:32.550
$3,000 sign in bonus was great for a while,

10:33.240 --> 10:37.096
but now we're recognizing the fact that everybody else has

10:37.118 --> 10:40.724
gotten hip to the game. So we've got to continuously

10:40.772 --> 10:44.388
think of something new and innovative to recruit and attract more talent.

10:44.484 --> 10:47.916
So Mayor Turner actually, and as well as some of the council members here,

10:47.938 --> 10:51.628
have been instrumental in kind of helping us develop CDL training

10:51.714 --> 10:55.336
programs that we're currently working on right now. And then we're

10:55.368 --> 10:59.048
also actively, still actively recruiting licensed

10:59.064 --> 11:02.784
CDL drivers, but we've also got a pay increase on the way for them

11:02.822 --> 11:06.412
as well. So hopefully that will continue to attract more qualified

11:06.476 --> 11:09.920
talent in this area. Next slide.

11:12.100 --> 11:15.556
Some of the FY 23 goals. Again I think the biggest goal that

11:15.578 --> 11:20.416
we have that you'll hear me constantly say is we want to reduce

11:20.448 --> 11:24.036
our dependency on the general fund. Meaning that we want to become a

11:24.058 --> 11:27.624
more sustainable department in the way that we, we manage our

11:27.662 --> 11:30.984
department, the way that we manage our resources and again become more

11:31.022 --> 11:34.916
solvent in that process. We want to diversify the revenue streams

11:34.948 --> 11:38.424
I know there's a lot of talk about the city of Houston not

11:38.462 --> 11:41.884
having a residential rate and then that is the case too.

11:41.922 --> 11:45.676
We would love to continue working on that and there's some other opportunities as

11:45.698 --> 11:49.656
well to diversify the revenue streams as well

11:49.778 --> 11:53.324
as it involves working in the commercial

11:53.372 --> 11:57.216
sector or offering our services to some of the commercial programs that

11:57.238 --> 12:00.512
may be out there throughout the city. We also

12:00.566 --> 12:04.628
plan to reduce our vacancy rate. We're currently hovering around 17% right now,

12:04.714 --> 12:08.544
department wide, maybe about 15% for our critical vacancies.

12:08.672 --> 12:11.956
Again, working with Mayor Turner, adjusting the

12:11.978 --> 12:15.316
starting salary that should be taking place within the next couple of

12:15.338 --> 12:19.092
days. We noticed that we think we'll be a little bit more competitive

12:19.156 --> 12:22.472
with our counterparts in the private industry and get our starting

12:22.526 --> 12:25.450
rate up closer to $22, $23 an hour.

12:26.220 --> 12:29.672
And then we really want to work on standardizing our routes too.

12:29.726 --> 12:32.444
And a lot of this has to do with the growth. And that's a good

12:32.482 --> 12:35.580
thing. The growth that the city of Houston has incurred over the last

12:35.730 --> 12:39.296
decade. And it's time for the solid waste department to catch up with

12:39.318 --> 12:43.372
that growth right now so that we can continue our quest and accomplish

12:43.436 --> 12:47.068
our goals as far as delivering on time services concerned.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.240
Next slide.

12:50.980 --> 12:54.464
It's just a little graph and some studies that we've been doing again

12:54.502 --> 12:57.876
with the long cities or the department's long range plan that's been out

12:57.898 --> 13:01.172
there. Just a couple of facts over the last ten years.

13:01.226 --> 13:04.984
I believe we see now the population of the city of Houston being about 6.6

13:05.022 --> 13:09.080
million. To us, that represents about 20,000

13:09.150 --> 13:13.176
additional households that we're still servicing with the same level

13:13.278 --> 13:16.890
of organizational support that we had ten years ago.

13:17.900 --> 13:21.676
And again about a 300 or 225 ton increase on

13:21.698 --> 13:25.164
a daily basis that we're still responsible for collecting. So we

13:25.202 --> 13:29.036
definitely feel the strain. Now the bottom, the other arrows may seem a little bit

13:29.058 --> 13:32.876
confusing because we have it pointing down, but it says 2% increase.

13:32.988 --> 13:36.336
The reason I did that is because again, the city has

13:36.358 --> 13:39.756
grown exponentially in those ten years and the department has not kept

13:39.788 --> 13:43.436
up with that growth and that's why we're experiencing such

13:43.478 --> 13:46.548
challenges with service delays, probably a less than a

13:46.554 --> 13:50.128
1% increase and no increase in the size of the fleet.

13:50.304 --> 13:53.596
You'll hear me constantly say we got to invest in our greatest

13:53.648 --> 13:57.304
assets, employees and equipment. Without those two,

13:57.422 --> 14:00.824
we can't deliver that service. Next slide. I'm sorry,

14:00.942 --> 14:04.344
can you hold that slide for a second? The top

14:04.382 --> 14:07.784
of the chart, the line graph, just kind of illustrates

14:07.832 --> 14:11.912
that relationship that you have. Most cities

14:11.976 --> 14:15.496
our size has when it comes down to full time employees,

14:15.528 --> 14:18.976
to number of households served. And you'll see the

14:18.998 --> 14:22.240
blue line, which represents our FTEs,

14:23.540 --> 14:27.456
normally should be above that orange line. As far as

14:27.478 --> 14:30.028
households serve, you want to keep that relationship.

14:30.214 --> 14:33.796
Houston is at the end. You see there's a big disparity there when it

14:33.818 --> 14:37.780
comes down to our counterparts. Next slide.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.548
And that concludes our presentation. Happy to

14:42.554 --> 14:45.592
answer any questions that anyone may have. Thank you, Director. First question

14:45.646 --> 14:49.080
comes from Council member Abby Cayman. Thanks, Chair.

14:49.660 --> 14:51.880
First Director.

14:53.340 --> 14:58.340
Thank you. And please relay our appreciation to everyone

14:58.430 --> 15:01.660
in the department, especially our drivers that are out in the field.

15:01.810 --> 15:05.436
Are they still working six days a week right now?

15:05.538 --> 15:09.180
Yes, we're still at six days a week, hopefully not much longer.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.890
Yeah, and I know I've seen some drivers out there.

15:12.660 --> 15:15.648
We all work late, but not as late as they do. We're not up as

15:15.654 --> 15:19.570
early as they are. So please relay my gratitude to them

15:21.380 --> 15:25.076
really quickly. I wanted to check in because we talked about

15:25.178 --> 15:28.612
the increase in multifamily and looking

15:28.666 --> 15:31.830
at additional needs towards the future.

15:32.920 --> 15:37.300
I had passed, with the support of council last fiscal year, a budget amendment

15:37.460 --> 15:41.864
that was going to direct the department by the end of fiscal year 22 to

15:41.902 --> 15:45.950
start the stakeholder engagement process. So we can be looking at

15:47.040 --> 15:50.956
mandatory multifamily recycling, whether the city takes on that burden or

15:50.978 --> 15:54.732
not, just requires private, but where

15:54.786 --> 15:58.636
are we in that process and has that begun yet? Yes, and that's a

15:58.658 --> 16:03.036
good question. I'm happy to report that process is going, it is ongoing.

16:03.228 --> 16:06.876
I believe the team started that prior to my arrival

16:06.988 --> 16:11.328
and since then, now we are to the point where we are meeting biweekly

16:11.424 --> 16:15.200
and when I say we, I'm talking about members of the Apartment

16:15.280 --> 16:19.460
Association and other industrial

16:19.800 --> 16:23.204
and commercial businesses throughout town that represents those

16:23.242 --> 16:26.488
areas. Perfect, because as we talk about future needs, and I know many of

16:26.494 --> 16:29.384
us around the Horseshoe bring this up as to you,

16:29.502 --> 16:32.824
the life cycle of our landfills and if we do not start

16:32.862 --> 16:36.972
curbing waste now, we're going to be in big trouble. So I

16:37.106 --> 16:41.448
thank you for that update. And in terms of the profitability

16:41.544 --> 16:45.084
of recycling materials right now, are we seeing an improvement in

16:45.122 --> 16:48.396
that? Yes, there's been a slight improvement in there. I think

16:48.418 --> 16:52.556
our CFO can attest to that as well. In fact, I don't

16:52.588 --> 16:56.240
believe we have to pay our processor now. Is that correct? Yeah.

16:56.310 --> 16:59.904
So the way our contract is set up is

16:59.942 --> 17:03.040
that when the materials, the blended value of the materials

17:03.120 --> 17:06.756
reaches a certain threshold that the city doesn't have to pay.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.956
Right. And just one follow up on that and then I'll go back in the

17:09.978 --> 17:14.016
queue. There was an effort to educate

17:14.048 --> 17:17.668
on the contamination of recyclable materials.

17:17.844 --> 17:21.048
Are we seeing an improvement in that? Yes, we are.

17:21.134 --> 17:24.792
And we're currently working with our processor right now to find out what that new

17:24.846 --> 17:28.364
rate is. When I arrived, I believe our contamination rate

17:28.402 --> 17:32.348
was around 39%. We're going to be doing another

17:32.434 --> 17:35.884
evaluation within the next couple of weeks, in the next

17:35.922 --> 17:39.964
week or two, and we expect that rate to be down. Terrific. We're already seeing

17:40.002 --> 17:43.680
indications fantastic. And if I could go back in queue, please make sure

17:43.830 --> 17:47.216
council Member Amy Pick. Thank you, Mayor Pertem. And thank you,

17:47.238 --> 17:50.272
Director. First, I want to thank you for the work that you're doing,

17:50.326 --> 17:54.736
especially in District Day. We've seen a huge improvement in collections

17:54.928 --> 17:58.176
since you've been on board. And when we were meeting

17:58.208 --> 18:01.910
about using our service funds to supplement the work,

18:02.360 --> 18:05.636
your question was you weren't just, of course we'll take

18:05.658 --> 18:09.544
your money. You were really questioning, well, why are we not picking it up on

18:09.582 --> 18:12.712
time? And I really appreciated how you were thinking about that.

18:12.766 --> 18:17.132
So my question is about the business recycling program and

18:17.186 --> 18:20.904
the commercial collections. Have those two programs

18:20.952 --> 18:25.084
been evaluated recently to see if it's beneficial to

18:25.122 --> 18:28.444
continue that financially or if that's something

18:28.482 --> 18:32.300
we should suspend or increase or has that been evaluated?

18:32.460 --> 18:36.080
Yes, and we're currently working with some partners

18:36.420 --> 18:40.160
here. When I say partners, I mean these are big partners, ExxonMobil and

18:40.230 --> 18:44.212
whatnot. So we have the small

18:44.266 --> 18:47.956
scale recycling, commercial recycling program for the small producers and

18:47.978 --> 18:51.956
small businesses. And that seems to be working relatively well right now. We know

18:51.978 --> 18:55.556
that there are some opportunities for improvement, and we're working on addressing

18:55.588 --> 18:59.304
that right now. But perhaps I think the biggest takeaway is

18:59.342 --> 19:02.616
that a lot of the partners that

19:02.638 --> 19:06.296
want to work with us right now, they see the value in that program.

19:06.398 --> 19:09.644
They appreciate the fact that we've gotten started and they're ready to

19:09.682 --> 19:13.004
help us take it to the next level. So abandoning it

19:13.122 --> 19:16.476
would not be the right choice at this time. And as far as

19:16.498 --> 19:20.440
the commercial collections for trash pickup, is that something that has been

19:20.450 --> 19:23.856
evaluated, too, where commercial businesses can

19:23.878 --> 19:27.820
basically contract with the city for a pickup? That's something that I'm evaluating

19:27.900 --> 19:31.524
right now. I still need to spend some time with our revenue and finance team,

19:31.722 --> 19:34.644
but I do see some serious potentials in there.

19:34.682 --> 19:37.510
Okay, thank you. We can't keep giving away the business.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.420
Council Member Sally Alcorn.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.520
Thank you, Chair, and thank you, director,

19:45.260 --> 19:48.580
for your presentation. You're operating

19:48.660 --> 19:52.328
according to the solid waste, long range solid waste plan

19:52.494 --> 19:55.480
at a $20 to $40 million deficit.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.916
Correct. Just walking in the door. $20 to $40 million

20:00.018 --> 20:04.300
down, we're picking up 391,000

20:04.370 --> 20:07.756
homes. Correct. We've got another 50,000

20:07.858 --> 20:11.512
on sponsorship that are paying their own private trash.

20:11.576 --> 20:15.820
Correct. I really appreciated your slide that

20:15.890 --> 20:19.324
had the different cities on there. I would add that

20:19.362 --> 20:22.884
those cities that you have on those

20:22.922 --> 20:26.740
slides, especially Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, all have a fee.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.672
The fee in Dallas

20:30.816 --> 20:33.968
is $34.30.

20:34.064 --> 20:38.468
Weekly garbage and recycling, monthly brush and bulky bulk waste.

20:38.564 --> 20:42.024
Austin has pay as you throw ranges from twenty two

20:42.062 --> 20:46.156
dollars and sixty five cents to forty nine dollars and fifty cents a

20:46.178 --> 20:49.980
month. San Antonio, $14 through

20:50.050 --> 20:53.470
they also have pays. You throw through $26.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.988
It's employees and it's equipment. And I don't

20:58.024 --> 21:02.224
see how you get there with $96 million a year

21:02.342 --> 21:06.210
from the general fund. So I'd like you to

21:06.660 --> 21:10.044
give me your experience in Tampa and any other

21:10.102 --> 21:14.500
experience you have with how a fee was originated

21:15.080 --> 21:18.404
and how you think that might play out here. Absolutely,

21:18.522 --> 21:22.176
sure. In Tampa, as well as other enterprise

21:22.208 --> 21:25.540
fund departments in the solid waste industry,

21:26.120 --> 21:30.196
fee was a little bit higher in Tamps, around $36 per household.

21:30.308 --> 21:33.448
But that fee was also covering the cost

21:33.534 --> 21:37.036
of the service. So employees and

21:37.058 --> 21:40.936
equipment first supplies the other associated

21:40.968 --> 21:44.510
expenses that come along with managing a solid waste program.

21:45.040 --> 21:48.552
People often forget about the true cost of disposal.

21:48.696 --> 21:52.476
Those are real dollars. So when we show up at a disposal

21:52.508 --> 21:57.196
facility at a landfill and we have to drive across someone's scales,

21:57.388 --> 22:01.132
there's no sort of internal fund transfer that satisfies

22:01.196 --> 22:04.896
that transaction. There's a check that they're looking for and that disposal

22:04.928 --> 22:08.596
cost usually cost about a third of the service. And if

22:08.618 --> 22:12.372
I was going to rank it, I would probably rank it somewhere between number

22:12.426 --> 22:15.892
one and three. When it comes down to the assets,

22:15.956 --> 22:19.096
it's going to be right there. Between the cost of employees and the cost of

22:19.118 --> 22:23.588
equipment are the three greatest costs

22:23.604 --> 22:27.416
of that service. So again, that's what your rate is designed to cover.

22:27.598 --> 22:30.940
In Tampa, we also had a different disposal system,

22:31.010 --> 22:34.396
so we had a bond to cover. So our rate was designed to cover the

22:34.418 --> 22:37.790
cost of satisfying the bond each year.

22:38.640 --> 22:42.144
However, once we reached the areas and the bonds matured and we

22:42.182 --> 22:45.500
paid that bond off, we enjoyed a $14 million swing.

22:45.660 --> 22:49.312
Really, it's about a $28 million swing. All of that money

22:49.366 --> 22:53.528
did not stay in the department. We can't show a profit.

22:53.644 --> 22:56.656
We cover our reserves, rainy day funds

22:56.688 --> 22:59.988
and whatnot. The rest of that has to go back to the general fund in

22:59.994 --> 23:03.616
order to support other areas of the city. So whenever

23:03.648 --> 23:06.324
you hear me talk about a rate or bringing on a rate,

23:06.442 --> 23:09.736
it's number one to take care of what we need to take care of in

23:09.758 --> 23:13.416
house so that we can deliver the on time service and have the equipment that

23:13.438 --> 23:16.808
we need so that our men and women can show up and

23:16.894 --> 23:20.184
deliver that and not have to stay out until eight or 09:00

23:20.232 --> 23:23.804
at night or come in on a Sunday. But it's to cover that

23:23.842 --> 23:27.630
first and then support the other areas of the city that need it second.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.164
And when you talk about the city of Houston, we got a lot of work

23:31.202 --> 23:34.880
to do, right. So if we were to embark upon that road,

23:35.030 --> 23:38.176
it's going to be a couple of years before we start seeing the benefits of

23:38.198 --> 23:41.248
that return. But the goal would be, again, as I mentioned earlier,

23:41.344 --> 23:44.804
to reduce our dependency on the general fund and

23:44.842 --> 23:48.704
allow those funds to be used for other areas throughout

23:48.752 --> 23:52.276
the city. I told Council Member Pat I

23:52.298 --> 23:55.896
was offended when she sat across from me and said that she wanted to

23:55.998 --> 23:59.050
run her solid waste programs like, well, what are we?

24:01.980 --> 24:05.576
And I know Houston has gotten away with it, but I think with the

24:05.598 --> 24:08.668
times and conditions and the way things are today,

24:08.834 --> 24:12.268
we've got to find some way to offset that, and I think our residents and

24:12.274 --> 24:16.184
customers deserve better. Council Member

24:16.232 --> 24:19.644
Carolyn Evan Shabbaz. Thank you, Mayor Protem. And thank you,

24:19.682 --> 24:23.584
director. I don't know if you ever settled. I know we talked about living

24:23.622 --> 24:25.810
in district d, but at any rate,

24:26.980 --> 24:30.668
I'm just curious. We talked before about hot teams

24:30.844 --> 24:34.272
and how only some districts have to

24:34.326 --> 24:37.956
employ people for hot teams. In my particular

24:38.058 --> 24:41.188
district, we employ four people and

24:41.274 --> 24:45.432
pay for two trucks. And I think we talked about how that cost could

24:45.486 --> 24:49.048
possibly be absorbed because it

24:49.054 --> 24:52.520
does take out of our districts, whereas there are others

24:52.590 --> 24:56.184
that don't have to pay those costs. So I didn't see anything

24:56.302 --> 24:59.628
in the budget regarding that, and so I'm encouraged that

24:59.714 --> 25:03.468
there's still an opportunity. So maybe you can address

25:03.554 --> 25:07.292
that in terms of making that a little bit more equitable. Thank you.

25:07.346 --> 25:10.864
And to make sure I understand your question, are you talking about being able

25:10.902 --> 25:14.524
to cover the cost of what the hot teams are providing or expenses

25:14.572 --> 25:17.984
associated with all districts? I don't think all

25:18.022 --> 25:21.892
the districts have them. There are those that do, but there are all

25:21.946 --> 25:24.868
districts. Do you have one? A hot team? No.

25:24.954 --> 25:28.612
Okay. No. We're talking about

25:28.666 --> 25:32.308
solid waste right now. So I'm not trying to compare what each person

25:32.394 --> 25:35.784
pays, but my question is we have to hire four.

25:35.822 --> 25:39.624
I have in my case, we are four men or

25:39.662 --> 25:43.620
women, and we pay for two trucks for trash

25:43.700 --> 25:46.936
pickup. And I'm just wondering because you and I

25:46.958 --> 25:49.996
had the conversation not trying to say that others don't pay for

25:50.018 --> 25:54.024
other things, that I may pay for something that you may not, but somewhat

25:54.152 --> 25:58.450
it just doesn't somewhat seem equitable for

25:58.900 --> 26:02.784
some districts to have to pay for hot teams and employ

26:02.902 --> 26:06.112
additional people to pick up that which all

26:06.166 --> 26:09.760
Houstonians expect. Right. And so if you could address

26:09.830 --> 26:13.540
that, I'd appreciate it. Absolutely. And I think what we may be seeing

26:13.610 --> 26:18.916
is it may speak to trying

26:18.938 --> 26:22.900
to find the right way to say this, the difference in neighborhoods

26:23.240 --> 26:26.744
throughout the city of Houston, as large as it is. You have

26:26.782 --> 26:31.044
some neighborhoods where we see development occurring,

26:31.092 --> 26:34.708
and as that development is occurring, we notice the amount of illegal

26:34.724 --> 26:38.044
dumping and the needs for hot teams will

26:38.082 --> 26:41.352
kind of draw down. In other districts.

26:41.416 --> 26:45.384
They may have a few more commercial areas than residential

26:45.432 --> 26:49.056
areas, so their approach may be a little bit different. It may be

26:49.078 --> 26:52.796
a quarterly approach or something of that nature. But what we're

26:52.828 --> 26:55.904
seeing and what I'm observing is that each district has

26:55.942 --> 26:59.904
its own unique features, and one

26:59.942 --> 27:03.396
district may require a hot team. And we appreciate the hot

27:03.418 --> 27:07.236
teams because they kind of fill in the gap right now where

27:07.258 --> 27:10.724
we want to, but we just can't because we're trying to address the more

27:10.762 --> 27:14.164
pressing issues. And I think that's why you may see

27:14.202 --> 27:17.576
that from as I travel throughout and I look at some of the neighborhoods and

27:17.598 --> 27:20.968
I see where there is a greater need for some of

27:20.974 --> 27:24.648
those areas. And I think the wonderful thing that I've learned about City of

27:24.654 --> 27:27.756
Houston, I was kind of kicking myself because I wish I would have met with

27:27.778 --> 27:31.452
them on the first day that I was here is the Mayor's Office of

27:31.506 --> 27:35.272
Innovation and Sustainability. They've got some wonderful

27:35.336 --> 27:39.084
ideas. And we were chatting the other day about now

27:39.122 --> 27:42.816
that we know where a majority of our debris is being generated at

27:42.998 --> 27:46.448
what kind of programs, how can we augment our programs so that we

27:46.454 --> 27:49.776
can concentrate our equipment in those areas and not

27:49.798 --> 27:53.196
as heavy on the areas where there is not as much generation

27:53.228 --> 27:56.676
of the illegal dumping and whatnot? And I think that's why a lot of

27:56.698 --> 27:59.796
times you'll see that difference. Right. I do understand that it's a

27:59.818 --> 28:03.092
difference, but we had talked about it, and I didn't know if you were

28:03.146 --> 28:06.424
able to do that, which we talked about, but apparently not

28:06.462 --> 28:09.908
at this juncture, not at this time. But we're still working on it. We haven't

28:09.924 --> 28:14.090
forgot about that request. Thank you. And in fact, I'm going to

28:14.540 --> 28:17.310
address something in your district pretty soon.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.500
Vice chair, Ed Pollard.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.220
Chatty Cathy over there. Thank you, Chair, and thank you,

28:26.290 --> 28:30.128
Director, for your presentation. A couple of

28:30.134 --> 28:33.584
things. One, if we were

28:33.622 --> 28:36.784
to have a fee, what would be some

28:36.822 --> 28:40.112
of the priority areas of your department that

28:40.166 --> 28:44.756
would see an impact from that fee from

28:44.778 --> 28:48.324
the jump? Would it be additional drivers? Would it be pay

28:48.362 --> 28:51.828
for additional equipment? Like, where would that money go towards?

28:51.914 --> 28:55.848
Right. So when you say from the jump for us, from the jump means

28:55.934 --> 28:59.096
at least a year out with the

28:59.118 --> 29:02.840
time that's required to secure equipment

29:03.180 --> 29:06.584
and the shortages and the backlogs and

29:06.622 --> 29:10.124
what it takes to secure that equipment, you're talking

29:10.162 --> 29:13.804
about a good year, a year and a half out. So what

29:13.842 --> 29:17.116
you would see right off the bat is on time service. So you put

29:17.138 --> 29:20.744
your recycling container out on Monday, and that's your schedule collection

29:20.792 --> 29:24.304
day. It's collected by Monday at 05:00. Okay, thank you.

29:24.342 --> 29:27.744
And also, I just want to give you a shout out for being real open

29:27.782 --> 29:31.104
minded about the District J Private Trash Day and working with

29:31.142 --> 29:35.004
our office to collaborate on ways in which to make that program efficient.

29:35.132 --> 29:38.980
It's something that we're continuing and that the constituents seem to

29:39.050 --> 29:42.464
find beneficial. So thank you again. Look forward to continuing

29:42.512 --> 29:45.284
working with you. Thank you,

29:45.482 --> 29:49.144
Director. Wilfred, I must say, you've done a bang up job in your initial time

29:49.182 --> 29:52.420
here. I used to always tell everybody, I love me some Harry Hayes.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.624
I'll always love me some Harry Hayes. But you've done a great

29:55.662 --> 29:58.888
job coming in and picking up what Harry Hayes started developing.

29:58.984 --> 30:02.632
I hate to see Mr. Anthony Bowie retiring.

30:02.696 --> 30:05.916
And I see Ms. Carolyn out there. They did a

30:05.938 --> 30:08.972
great job for us many, many times,

30:09.026 --> 30:12.272
and especially in 2017, when I had the

30:12.326 --> 30:16.492
blessing and the honor of working with, I think, one of your counterparts.

30:16.556 --> 30:19.744
He actually did a stint in Temp in Tampa. Mr.

30:19.782 --> 30:23.248
Mccreck, Kerry, and David ran solid waste in

30:23.254 --> 30:26.612
San Antonio at the time. And Jessica and I spent literally 40

30:26.666 --> 30:30.308
days in a row with them, never missing a day. And he and

30:30.314 --> 30:33.124
I would talk about various things. And one of the things that struck me is

30:33.162 --> 30:36.884
he was telling me that you all had a waste energy plant

30:36.932 --> 30:40.536
in Tampa and you would sell the waste to the energy

30:40.638 --> 30:44.408
electric company and they would move the waste into

30:44.494 --> 30:48.252
electricity. Is there any option for us here in the city

30:48.306 --> 30:52.044
to do something similar to what you did in Tampa? I would love

30:52.082 --> 30:54.300
it. It is an expensive undertaker,

30:55.280 --> 30:58.992
I tell you, but it is definitely a way

30:59.046 --> 31:02.576
to save space, and it eliminates the need for

31:02.598 --> 31:05.248
the landfills. That's the biggest value right there.

31:05.414 --> 31:08.690
So, idea wise, how much does it cost?

31:09.380 --> 31:11.970
Today, you're probably looking at about a billion dollars.

31:12.340 --> 31:16.064
Yeah. The last one that I know of that was permitted in South

31:16.112 --> 31:19.604
Florida was about 880,000,000. And that was about three or four

31:19.642 --> 31:23.860
years ago. Okay. And another quick question. Years ago,

31:23.930 --> 31:27.700
we made a lot of money on commodities.

31:27.860 --> 31:31.690
The commodity market was a lot different. How is it today? I know that

31:32.220 --> 31:35.528
I'm literally thinking maybe six, seven years ago, we were making a

31:35.534 --> 31:38.536
good deal of money on commodities and then went south on us, and then we

31:38.558 --> 31:41.676
started paying waste management to take our

31:41.698 --> 31:45.196
commodities. Is there any coming back in that market I haven't really looked

31:45.218 --> 31:48.444
at? Yeah, it's kind of leveled out, but we're still not seeing what you all

31:48.482 --> 31:52.308
enjoyed during that time ago. In fact, from Florida,

31:52.344 --> 31:56.064
I used to look at that and I used to catch heat because people would

31:56.102 --> 32:00.428
say, how come you're not doing what Texas is doing? But again, it's a

32:00.454 --> 32:04.240
regional market. It's very volatile.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.936
I definitely wouldn't bet my life savings

32:07.968 --> 32:11.636
on it. But right now, we're kind of breaking even in

32:11.658 --> 32:15.684
that recycling market as far as the commodities are concerned. Thank you,

32:15.882 --> 32:19.176
Director Bowie. We'll miss you. You've done a great

32:19.198 --> 32:22.056
job for us, for you. And so have you, director Wright. Even though you're not

32:22.078 --> 32:25.160
going anywhere, we're not letting you. Council member Robert Gallegos.

32:25.520 --> 32:29.032
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. Thank you, Director, for the presentation.

32:29.096 --> 32:32.780
It was enjoyed visiting with you last week

32:32.930 --> 32:35.180
in regards to getting some updates,

32:35.920 --> 32:38.910
I know that leaving my office right now.

32:39.840 --> 32:43.376
Constituent services pointed out to me that we have a constituent that

32:43.398 --> 32:46.944
has been waiting for a trash can, because I believe their trash can

32:46.982 --> 32:50.728
was stolen, and they've been waiting for a. Trash can since April.

32:50.924 --> 32:54.916
I know that we have some trash cans that

32:54.938 --> 32:59.316
are sitting on Capitol Street that they're still been waiting for

32:59.338 --> 33:02.976
that trash to be picked up. And I say all this because

33:03.018 --> 33:06.756
I want you to elaborate what's happening in regards

33:06.788 --> 33:10.084
to trucks breaking down, the lack of hiring employees.

33:10.132 --> 33:13.576
That way the general public can hear exactly what

33:13.598 --> 33:17.464
the issues are because all

33:17.502 --> 33:21.192
they see is that they want their can and the can is not being delivered.

33:21.256 --> 33:24.236
Right. All they're seeing is that they want their trash can picked up and their

33:24.258 --> 33:27.708
trash hasn't been delivered until they call our office and we try to

33:27.714 --> 33:31.244
explain to them what the situation is. If we're leaning

33:31.292 --> 33:34.688
towards a fee, we need to let the

33:34.694 --> 33:38.188
public know why. So if you can elaborate

33:38.284 --> 33:41.640
what the issues are, please. Yeah, and there's several

33:41.820 --> 33:45.652
compounding issues and I think we also want to be clear to

33:45.706 --> 33:49.028
say that the fee gets us going in the

33:49.034 --> 33:51.792
right direction. It's not the magic elixir.

33:51.936 --> 33:55.416
So what people may be experiencing when they

33:55.438 --> 33:58.968
run into those delays is, again, we're dealing with

33:59.054 --> 34:02.200
420 some odd employees department wide.

34:02.700 --> 34:06.020
That's not enough. 645 sq mi.

34:06.100 --> 34:09.436
645 sq mi. Exactly. So what

34:09.458 --> 34:13.484
you see the team doing is concentrating on the big

34:13.522 --> 34:16.940
fires and trying to keep those from growing even larger.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.864
So if somebody's waiting on a can, it could very well be because

34:20.982 --> 34:24.540
another team member was reassigned to take care of a route

34:24.700 --> 34:27.010
and that may have been more pressing that day.

34:27.620 --> 34:31.244
We have some systems that we also have to kind of update

34:31.292 --> 34:34.880
and how we as it pertains to logistics

34:34.960 --> 34:38.404
and maybe service order management to kind of

34:38.442 --> 34:41.856
make that a little bit more electronic than manual. So that's part of the growth

34:41.888 --> 34:45.288
and development opportunities that we have in the department that we

34:45.294 --> 34:47.130
haven't been able to take advantage of.

34:48.220 --> 34:52.532
And again, you mentioned earlier about the vehicles. Some of the vehicles

34:52.596 --> 35:01.496
in our fleet are as old as minimum

35:01.528 --> 35:04.856
ten years old. And the average life of a garbage truck

35:04.888 --> 35:08.540
should be around five to seven years. You should be replacing them.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.884
So we've got to get that vehicle replacement program

35:12.002 --> 35:15.504
up to where it should be so that once we know that five

35:15.542 --> 35:19.184
to seven year mark is there, we're looking at trying to replace that.

35:19.222 --> 35:22.656
Because believe it or not, you're spending more money on maintaining

35:22.688 --> 35:26.516
that vehicle than the vehicle is now worth. So when

35:26.538 --> 35:30.368
those vehicles break down, if the manufacturers and you've

35:30.384 --> 35:33.956
got your three models or four models in now, you've got to wait

35:33.978 --> 35:37.716
on a part to be fabricated in order to get that vehicle fixed,

35:37.748 --> 35:41.720
which means it has to sit and wait for a couple of weeks longer.

35:41.870 --> 35:46.036
And all of that when you don't have, again, two greatest assets the absence

35:46.068 --> 35:49.612
of employees, the absence of equipment. You're going to experience those

35:49.666 --> 35:53.244
delays in services. So the

35:53.282 --> 35:56.428
model that the team has generated that seems to be effective right now.

35:56.514 --> 35:59.820
They're always going to concentrate on garbage first.

35:59.970 --> 36:03.376
We don't want that to sit out for days and whatnot and

36:03.398 --> 36:07.324
draw the flies and vectors that come along with that. And then we'll

36:07.372 --> 36:12.064
make up the recycling a little bit later during the week. So just

36:12.102 --> 36:15.872
a snapshot of the delay. And what I've stated to your predecessor,

36:16.016 --> 36:19.616
Director Hayes, when he brought this to my attention years ago, that we were needing

36:19.648 --> 36:22.996
a garbage fee because all these other major cities in the state of Texas have

36:23.018 --> 36:24.500
a monthly garbage fee.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.768
What I stated as when I was president of my civic club and president of

36:29.774 --> 36:33.370
the super neighborhood. And I've asked and mentioned this to

36:33.740 --> 36:37.148
civic clubs when I go out and they start talking about

36:37.314 --> 36:40.524
missed pickups and what have you regarding trash is

36:40.562 --> 36:44.328
that if there is a garbage fee, in my opinion,

36:44.504 --> 36:48.136
I'm hoping it's not just to pick up your trash

36:48.168 --> 36:51.616
can and your recycling bid. It's also going to be to pick

36:51.638 --> 36:55.008
up those tires that are being dumped on the

36:55.014 --> 36:58.384
vacant lot. It's also to be pick up that illegal dumping, that's being

36:58.422 --> 37:01.672
dumped in the neighborhood, that's bringing down our neighborhood,

37:01.836 --> 37:05.648
that's causing crime because of all this illegal dumping.

37:05.824 --> 37:10.228
So it's a catch 22 and we pay a

37:10.234 --> 37:14.048
monthly garbage fee. Constituents are going to expect more than just picking

37:14.064 --> 37:17.636
up the trash can and your recycling bin. And that's what

37:17.658 --> 37:20.856
I'm hoping will happen is that we'll be able to pick up those tires while

37:20.878 --> 37:24.136
I'm able to pick up the illegal dumping and clean up our neighborhoods at the

37:24.158 --> 37:28.204
same time. And I think the majority of the public will go

37:28.242 --> 37:31.676
with it. Exactly. Just to add

37:31.698 --> 37:34.972
on to that, again, there are some opportunities to create

37:35.026 --> 37:38.396
some more programs that concentrate on solid waste. And I

37:38.418 --> 37:42.620
know we have code enforcement officers and we work with our neighborhood department

37:42.700 --> 37:46.256
with that. But in order to address the issues that we

37:46.278 --> 37:49.708
have now, I really feel that there would be some benefits for the solid waste

37:49.724 --> 37:52.304
department to have its own code enforcement team,

37:52.502 --> 37:57.488
maybe two or three for each sector. And as we see these illegal

37:57.504 --> 38:01.188
dumping issues pop up, it gives us an opportunity to concentrate the

38:01.194 --> 38:04.804
time that's needed on mitigating the issues. And I know you brought that up

38:04.842 --> 38:08.456
to me when we met. And I totally agree that there needs to

38:08.478 --> 38:11.928
be code enforcement inspectors inside of waste so that

38:12.014 --> 38:15.576
those that end up putting their illegal dumping out a day or

38:15.598 --> 38:19.816
two after it was already picked up in the neighborhood, they can be told you're

38:19.848 --> 38:23.244
not supposed to do this. Give them a warning and hopefully they will

38:23.282 --> 38:26.300
stop doing that in that way of cleaning up our neighborhoods.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.664
Council Member David Robinson. Thank you, chair Director, thanks very

38:31.702 --> 38:35.392
much for all the reasons colleagues have said. I wanted to pick up

38:35.446 --> 38:40.624
not only on points made about the requisite

38:40.672 --> 38:44.736
collaboration that you have to do with other departments, whether that's the dawn

38:44.928 --> 38:48.432
in the case of potential generation

38:48.496 --> 38:51.876
of electricity that the Chair asked you about,

38:52.058 --> 38:55.240
we know that's real. We witnessed it ourselves.

38:55.580 --> 38:59.060
Mayor Pro TEM on our recent trip to Denmark,

38:59.140 --> 39:02.792
which is where we were escorted with the delegation, was really

39:02.846 --> 39:06.876
about the Public Works Department. And that's where

39:07.058 --> 39:11.164
the importance of your collaboration, Director, with those who

39:11.202 --> 39:15.192
have maybe more infrastructure dollars in their departments

39:15.256 --> 39:19.312
already. Or ways in which we can bridge the gap between

39:19.366 --> 39:23.584
our solid waste management concerns and how we

39:23.622 --> 39:26.928
might actually embrace how your

39:27.094 --> 39:30.500
part of our annual budget becomes part of our

39:30.570 --> 39:34.528
generation of electricity and our utility structure

39:34.624 --> 39:38.852
and part of what we're doing with the overall maintenance and management of

39:38.906 --> 39:42.128
our resources. And I know that's

39:42.144 --> 39:45.880
not news to you with your experience in Tampa. It's something I mean,

39:45.950 --> 39:49.850
you did throw out the billion dollar figure for

39:50.220 --> 39:53.656
a plant. And I'd like to observe that

39:53.678 --> 39:57.692
that is a really fungible number that's not set

39:57.746 --> 40:01.432
at one point. Repeating billion, that's scalable

40:01.496 --> 40:04.956
in a lot of different directions. How you do it, what you do with

40:04.978 --> 40:08.204
the money, is entirely subject to

40:08.322 --> 40:11.328
how we might devise or design a program.

40:11.494 --> 40:15.084
And so in your six months here, I know you've already brought

40:15.132 --> 40:18.544
a lot of innovation to the department. And I'm so

40:18.582 --> 40:22.256
pleased to see it and witness the work you're doing. I want

40:22.278 --> 40:25.796
to encourage you to continue to work with the Office of Innovation in

40:25.818 --> 40:29.350
the Mayor's department as well as the Sustainable Office.

40:29.800 --> 40:33.092
And that's really my comment. If you have anything to add

40:33.146 --> 40:36.760
to that, I'd love to hear it. Thank you. Council Member Robinson

40:37.500 --> 40:40.488
I don't want that billion dollars to scare you, right? It's a big number.

40:40.574 --> 40:44.164
But you got to look at the value of that beyond

40:44.212 --> 40:47.992
the dollars and cents. So that's land

40:48.046 --> 40:51.244
that you're not taking up that could probably be

40:51.282 --> 40:55.772
used for housing or some sort of future development or just

40:55.826 --> 40:59.612
preservation or whatever the case may be. And then the amount

40:59.746 --> 41:02.592
of revenue that you generate from the sale of energy,

41:02.646 --> 41:07.228
which you have to be careful of nowadays because you have other forms

41:07.244 --> 41:11.600
of energy that are now competitive on the market, CNG and whatnot

41:12.340 --> 41:16.160
you have to watch that, but it does go towards offsetting that expense.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.840
And just to give you a quick story of my level of ignorance,

41:19.920 --> 41:22.868
when I was appointed to be Director in Tampa, the first thing I wanted to

41:22.874 --> 41:26.936
do was sell the waste energy plant because it cost us

41:27.118 --> 41:31.000
10 million to run and we only got 5 million in return.

41:31.070 --> 41:34.520
I'm like, this doesn't make sense. But then I thought about it.

41:34.670 --> 41:37.692
Where are we going to go? Our trucks are going to have to drive 60

41:37.746 --> 41:41.804
miles now just to go to one landfill. So the value of

41:41.842 --> 41:46.284
having that waste energy plant there was

41:46.322 --> 41:49.936
more than just the dollars and cents. Appreciate that very much.

41:50.118 --> 41:53.884
Council Member Abby Cayman Director

41:53.932 --> 41:57.616
normally I ask a question, the question everyone's heard

41:57.638 --> 42:01.324
it already about the needs of the department looking forward, but I think you've covered

42:01.452 --> 42:04.612
a lot of those in terms of looking ahead at the future

42:04.666 --> 42:08.164
and what we need. Is there anything you want to add to

42:08.202 --> 42:12.070
that that has not been discussed? I'm glad you asked.

42:13.820 --> 42:16.730
No, but we did. We covered a lot of it.

42:17.980 --> 42:21.576
As far as any sort of unmet needs as it

42:21.598 --> 42:25.264
relates to that. You heard me talk about vehicle

42:25.332 --> 42:28.636
coordination. That really involves having someone in our

42:28.658 --> 42:31.496
department that just focuses on nothing but vehicles.

42:31.528 --> 42:35.256
And they maintain this outstanding relationship with fleet

42:35.288 --> 42:39.132
maintenance. They hold us accountable, make sure that we're taking care of

42:39.186 --> 42:42.748
the equipment and then they also work with fleet maintenance to make sure vehicles

42:42.764 --> 42:46.316
are available. You heard me speak often about code enforcement officers

42:46.348 --> 42:50.268
as well, a necessary part, additional drivers.

42:50.444 --> 42:53.492
Right now, probably one of the most startling things that I've seen

42:53.546 --> 42:56.550
is I go out on route run into,

42:57.320 --> 43:00.564
believe it's Daniel Williams at the Southeast Service Center.

43:00.602 --> 43:03.636
And he's picking up and I asked him how many homes does he

43:03.658 --> 43:07.092
have on his route and he tells me 3000. I said he's exaggerating.

43:07.156 --> 43:10.388
I get back to the service center to know he's telling the truth.

43:10.564 --> 43:14.052
And that's an example of the department continuously

43:14.116 --> 43:17.528
trying its quest to want to serve our public

43:17.614 --> 43:20.796
and provide that service and giving us everything we

43:20.818 --> 43:24.056
got. But I can tell you 3000 homes for one driver

43:24.088 --> 43:27.932
is unrealistic. The truck will be throwing in the towel at that point in time.

43:27.986 --> 43:30.868
They said they can't do it. We end up overworking the driver in the truck

43:30.904 --> 43:33.170
and we end up in a bad situation.

43:34.580 --> 43:38.176
Again, I definitely want to continue to focus on the illegal dumping this

43:38.198 --> 43:41.996
here. I want to see if we can start dropping some more cameras throughout

43:42.028 --> 43:46.144
the city in some of those areas that have a lot of that unnecessary activity,

43:46.272 --> 43:49.844
see if we can curb some of that behavior. Public Works has been

43:49.882 --> 43:53.616
great to work with as well. We're going to find some of the roads

43:53.648 --> 43:56.650
that are less traveled, like what we had on the news the other day,

43:57.180 --> 44:00.456
and see if we can just block some of the ingress and egress off to

44:00.478 --> 44:03.864
curb that behavior. Well, again, I appreciate it and like

44:03.902 --> 44:07.660
you said, one team or one person

44:07.730 --> 44:09.980
having to deal with 3000 homes,

44:11.280 --> 44:14.796
we shouldn't be asking any city employee to

44:14.818 --> 44:18.172
deal with that. So, thanks. My gratitude again. And also I know

44:18.226 --> 44:21.824
you've really put your head to the ground trying to figure

44:21.862 --> 44:25.616
out some new and unique ways of recruiting and job training.

44:25.718 --> 44:29.692
So I just appreciate the leadership

44:29.756 --> 44:32.230
you and your team are providing. Thank you.

44:32.760 --> 44:36.400
Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you, Chair.

44:36.560 --> 44:40.436
What are our annual tipping fees? I believe we

44:40.458 --> 44:43.880
hover around 25 $26

44:43.950 --> 44:47.864
per ton. And on

44:47.902 --> 44:50.788
the recycling revenue?

44:50.964 --> 44:54.808
The recycling fund performance measures, it has 12%

44:54.894 --> 44:58.910
curbside recycling. What exactly does that mean? What is that figure?

44:59.920 --> 45:03.784
It's on the performance measures in the budget book. It says curbside

45:03.832 --> 45:07.020
recycling rate, single stream, 12% target.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.436
I'm not familiar. I have to look that up. You're saying it's in the budget

45:11.468 --> 45:15.516
book? Roman numeral

45:15.548 --> 45:18.748
ten, 164. Okay. There's some targets.

45:18.764 --> 45:21.172
It's the same target as last year. I just don't know what that means.

45:21.306 --> 45:25.060
What's that? 12%. Okay, thank you. And you mentioned 15%

45:25.130 --> 45:28.784
critical vacancies in numbers. I'm curious

45:28.832 --> 45:32.356
on how many drivers you're down. About 55

45:32.458 --> 45:35.640
right now. 55? 55 drivers.

45:35.980 --> 45:39.704
Okay. What other critical positions are

45:39.822 --> 45:42.808
vacant? Those are going to be the critical. Those are critical. Okay, so when you

45:42.814 --> 45:46.776
talk critical vacancies, you're talking about drivers. Yeah, we're talking about drivers.

45:46.968 --> 45:50.140
And you're in the works of bringing those

45:50.210 --> 45:53.756
entry level salaries up? Absolutely. Mayor Turner and

45:53.778 --> 45:58.136
I have been working together and he's

45:58.168 --> 46:01.616
authorized a 6% increase. And now when we go

46:01.638 --> 46:05.536
out, we're also increasing the number of job fairs that we're attending working

46:05.558 --> 46:08.370
with our HR department, jane Cheeks and her team. Okay,

46:09.940 --> 46:13.852
great. And thank you for your help on composting. I noticed it on your accomplishments,

46:13.916 --> 46:17.664
the composting drop off. And thank you for working with the Office of Innovation

46:17.712 --> 46:21.344
and my team on what might come next. I agree with Council Member Gallegos.

46:21.392 --> 46:24.320
I think that the fee is going to have to come with some extras.

46:24.400 --> 46:27.976
And I think if we do go to curbside recycling like other

46:27.998 --> 46:31.736
cities, it would be a voluntary program and an additional fee on the people who

46:31.758 --> 46:35.156
want to participate. And you'd be surprised how many want to participate.

46:35.268 --> 46:38.504
Denver has started this and there's thousands and thousands.

46:38.632 --> 46:42.456
But I can't put anything more on the solid waste

46:42.488 --> 46:46.188
department. We're trying to get less trash so we

46:46.194 --> 46:49.656
can save more of that $25 per ton in shipping

46:49.688 --> 46:53.264
fees. Absolutely. Thank you. Council member Tasha Jackson. Thank you.

46:53.302 --> 46:56.848
And thank you, director, and your team. I just wanted to commend you

46:56.854 --> 47:00.672
guys on a great job that you're doing. Just working with you,

47:00.726 --> 47:03.828
our hot team. Of course I have the hot team. And you had a

47:03.834 --> 47:08.196
conversation about that. I was hoping we can pull them out, but we

47:08.218 --> 47:11.988
can't. So we can use our dollars somewhere else. But you

47:11.994 --> 47:16.344
can see the difference. You can see the neighborhood is a little bit

47:16.542 --> 47:20.088
cleaned, a little bit better, but we need more work and

47:20.094 --> 47:23.016
I know we need more money. And so I just want you to know I

47:23.038 --> 47:26.200
support the fee if you guys

47:26.270 --> 47:29.688
approach that. Approach that because I know we need dollars to move the follow waste

47:29.704 --> 47:33.164
department together forward. But I just want to say congratulations and thank you

47:33.202 --> 47:36.732
for everything that you're doing. Thank you. If I can just add to that,

47:36.866 --> 47:39.790
and I've heard Mayor Turner mention it as well,

47:41.520 --> 47:45.292
another part of success, even though it doesn't involve this, is the funding,

47:45.436 --> 47:49.184
ARPA funding and some of the grant funding that we're able to take advantage of.

47:49.302 --> 47:53.004
I would really like to position the department so that when that funding

47:53.052 --> 47:56.432
goes away, we can continue to maintain some of these programs

47:56.576 --> 47:59.716
that we're able to embark upon right now. And I did ask my

47:59.738 --> 48:02.436
question, the anti litter campaign. So would that continue?

48:02.538 --> 48:06.340
Because that's been a big help. Yes, we are actually in the process of

48:06.410 --> 48:10.008
evaluating bids on that right now. Okay. So that will continue,

48:10.094 --> 48:13.416
and you should not experience a gap in that. That's been the help. So thank

48:13.438 --> 48:16.840
you so much for keeping that council member, Robert Gallegos.

48:17.180 --> 48:20.796
Thank you for Tim. And again, thank you, Director, for everything. You're doing an

48:20.818 --> 48:25.180
outstanding job. I know you're new here and you're getting all these headaches,

48:25.680 --> 48:29.688
but you're doing a great job. So thank you. I just also want

48:29.714 --> 48:33.376
to mention that if we do go with the possibly in the

48:33.398 --> 48:36.752
near future, in the future, a fee that

48:36.806 --> 48:40.448
also, hopefully we follow. I understand Director Hayes had mentioned

48:40.614 --> 48:44.132
the San Antonio model where they have a large trash can.

48:44.186 --> 48:48.240
They have a small trash can, and it depends on the homeowner.

48:48.400 --> 48:51.556
If they have quite a bit of trash, then they'll be paying for

48:51.578 --> 48:55.184
a large trash can, whatever that monthly

48:55.232 --> 48:58.576
fee is. If they have a small trash can, then they'll be paying

48:58.618 --> 49:01.608
a little less than what that normal fee is.

49:01.774 --> 49:05.050
So hopefully that's another model that we can follow also,

49:06.380 --> 49:10.412
and that also encourages people to put more recycling stuff into

49:10.466 --> 49:14.092
your recycling bin, so that way you'll have a smaller trash can and pay

49:14.146 --> 49:17.836
less on your fee. So I'm hoping that's something that

49:17.858 --> 49:22.080
we can look at as well. I'm with you 100%.

49:22.150 --> 49:26.050
I can't even speak. You're talking just as much trash as I am right now.

49:27.940 --> 49:32.064
So there are no other council members in queue. I'll ask my last question a

49:32.102 --> 49:34.916
couple of years ago. This is probably six years ago.

49:35.018 --> 49:39.104
As you well know, many areas of the city have private trash

49:39.152 --> 49:43.380
collection, and we pay them $6 a month per household

49:45.580 --> 49:49.272
for them to get their private collection. We looked at

49:49.326 --> 49:52.920
eliminating that, and we discovered that eliminating that

49:52.990 --> 49:56.392
would cost us a ton of money more, mainly because

49:56.446 --> 49:59.964
we don't have the workforce and we don't have the trucks. So we kept that

50:00.002 --> 50:03.196
intact. So when you talk about garbage fee, I know

50:03.378 --> 50:07.052
it would have to be across the board, so everyone in the city

50:07.106 --> 50:10.464
of Houston would have to be a part of it. So let's say if you

50:10.502 --> 50:14.588
have 500,000 households

50:14.764 --> 50:18.800
and it was $72 a year, $6 a month

50:18.870 --> 50:23.364
times twelve months, that would equate to probably around $34 million

50:23.482 --> 50:26.916
that we could use on something like that. But my question to you, I'm not

50:26.938 --> 50:30.790
sure what you had in Tampa or your other experience.

50:31.160 --> 50:35.332
How difficult is it to get folks that are on private collection where

50:35.386 --> 50:39.032
we really in order for us to pick it up, it would cost

50:39.086 --> 50:42.440
us probably three or four times the $6 a month.

50:42.510 --> 50:46.410
Right. How do we put the genie back in the bottle? In that case,

50:47.020 --> 50:50.812
I think we offer a rate that is just as competitive as

50:50.866 --> 50:54.604
the private company that is providing that current level of service.

50:54.802 --> 50:58.204
I think although we pay $6 a month, I believe that

50:58.242 --> 51:01.410
those residents are actually paying a little bit more to the company.

51:03.460 --> 51:07.164
We just have to make sure that we cover our cost of service. And normally

51:07.212 --> 51:10.636
with municipalities, that rate is a little bit lower than

51:10.678 --> 51:13.920
our private counterparts. They are there to turn a profit.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.812
We're there for reliability. So if we cover our cost

51:17.866 --> 51:21.590
of service, we should be just as competitive. However,

51:22.600 --> 51:26.216
we're to the position right now, like you mentioned earlier, we can't take on any

51:26.238 --> 51:29.704
additional service right now. So the key to doing that

51:29.742 --> 51:33.016
is to crawl before we walk. Yeah.

51:33.118 --> 51:36.452
Great. Thank you. And before I leave, another great employee,

51:36.516 --> 51:40.020
fairly new Veronica, doing a great job for us. So thank you. I'll pass that

51:40.030 --> 51:43.900
along. Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you, chair. And just to jump in,

51:43.970 --> 51:47.452
I just want to be clear. If you have private trash right now, you're already

51:47.506 --> 51:51.740
paying a fee for your private trash. You would not be paying the city's

51:51.820 --> 51:55.564
trash fee. It would be like clear, like water authority,

51:55.612 --> 51:59.760
people not paying the drainage. Calm down. I didn't say that. I know exactly

51:59.830 --> 52:03.540
what we pay. We get $6 a month,

52:03.610 --> 52:07.220
$72 a year. And we pay waste management or

52:07.290 --> 52:11.780
a trash collection in addition to it. So my question is

52:11.930 --> 52:15.316
if we talk about a garbage fee and it goes citywide, there is no way

52:15.338 --> 52:18.040
on God's green earth these guys will be able to pick it up right away.

52:18.110 --> 52:21.416
No way. Yeah. So you'd keep your private trust. Yeah. And all

52:21.438 --> 52:25.770
you hear me talk about building it up. Right. Building those reserves. The first

52:26.140 --> 52:29.692
priority should be reducing our dependency on the general fund.

52:29.826 --> 52:33.564
That means we're able to stand on our own. Once we do that,

52:33.762 --> 52:37.400
we don't take on any additional service until we can cover the costs.

52:37.480 --> 52:40.748
That means that we have the employees and equipment to provide that service. Exactly.

52:40.834 --> 52:43.436
So you have to have a build up, take you a year to buy equipment

52:43.468 --> 52:47.164
and employees. And from what we're experiencing right now, we can't get drivers.

52:47.212 --> 52:50.240
Right. So how are you going to get drivers to do citywide?

52:50.580 --> 52:52.896
Mayor Turner. And I got a plan. We're going to turn that around. You got

52:52.918 --> 52:55.812
a plan? I like that. Well, thank you. Appreciate it.

52:55.866 --> 52:59.380
Thanks for your time. Thank you. We have a 1234

52:59.450 --> 53:03.640
public speakers. We'll start it out with Mr. Jason Oliver.

53:04.940 --> 53:06.600
Star six to unmute.

53:10.690 --> 53:14.314
First, I'm concerned about driver safety.

53:14.442 --> 53:18.222
I know that solid waste has been doing a lot with very

53:18.276 --> 53:21.826
little and it seems like even less this year in the

53:21.848 --> 53:24.962
budget we're looking at. Council member Cayman talked about early days

53:25.016 --> 53:28.654
and late nights with people working six days a week. I recall reading an article

53:28.702 --> 53:31.918
about a driver fainting and we're approaching the summer,

53:32.014 --> 53:35.522
how are we taking care of driver safety and are we making improvements

53:35.586 --> 53:39.346
there? And then a second question to follow up on something Council Member

53:39.378 --> 53:42.994
Pollard said, because I want to make sure I know who to direct my comments

53:43.042 --> 53:46.118
to. Directors report. He said Directors report to the

53:46.124 --> 53:49.158
mayor and they were directed to leave. It sounds like you're telling us that it's

53:49.174 --> 53:52.934
not city council, but the mayor who directed city staff not to respond

53:52.982 --> 53:56.014
to our questions. So I just want to make sure should we be directing our

53:56.052 --> 53:59.630
concerns about this policy to council or to the mayor?

54:02.450 --> 54:05.838
You can direct your questions to council if

54:06.004 --> 54:09.570
you have a direct question for council, if you have a

54:09.720 --> 54:13.714
question that is specific to a director, you can

54:13.752 --> 54:16.914
submit those to your council office and we would send those

54:16.952 --> 54:20.040
to the director to get a response for you.

54:21.690 --> 54:24.998
Right, but the policy change that was made

54:25.164 --> 54:28.886
around budget workshops that we hadn't had in previous years, I'm trying to

54:28.908 --> 54:32.086
figure out how we get that back. Yes,

54:32.188 --> 54:35.702
council Member Cayman jason, just to be clear,

54:35.756 --> 54:39.206
I said this before, I'm not chair of BFA,

54:39.238 --> 54:41.706
so I can't speak for that. But what I do know as a chair of

54:41.728 --> 54:45.402
a committee is there is always, including at public safety

54:45.546 --> 54:48.698
been a standing

54:48.794 --> 54:52.526
procedural rule where questions are taken from the

54:52.548 --> 54:56.826
public, submitted to the departments and then responded

54:56.858 --> 55:00.114
to. My understanding is also in terms of time,

55:00.232 --> 55:03.538
things like that. We've already been here and I was going

55:03.544 --> 55:07.218
to thank Saba and others for sitting here all day.

55:07.384 --> 55:11.046
I understand the commitment. All I'm explaining is

55:11.148 --> 55:15.014
this wasn't a rule change. The chair even

55:15.052 --> 55:18.902
indicated that we messed up the first

55:18.956 --> 55:23.126
go round. It has always been in our committees

55:23.318 --> 55:26.726
that questions are submitted from the public, they're submitted

55:26.758 --> 55:30.154
to the departments for a response. For example, my staff takes

55:30.272 --> 55:33.382
all questions from public safety comments,

55:33.526 --> 55:37.438
submits them to department and then emails them back. So I just wanted again,

55:37.524 --> 55:41.342
I'm not telling you which way to feel about it, but I wanted to

55:41.396 --> 55:45.386
speak up for the chair in terms of other committees,

55:45.418 --> 55:48.660
that has been the standard process as well.

55:51.350 --> 55:54.754
Right, but not for the budget workshops. We've been here in

55:54.792 --> 55:58.990
previous years. So I just want to be clear about like, that's not general

55:59.080 --> 56:02.200
practice and it hasn't been standard practice in previous years.

56:03.050 --> 56:05.080
The recordings show it.

56:08.090 --> 56:12.026
I've been sitting here for nine years doing this, so I

56:12.048 --> 56:15.446
think I know a little bit about it. But anyway, I appreciate

56:15.478 --> 56:18.794
your comments. Jason, good to have you here this week.

56:18.992 --> 56:20.250
Jill Grochell,

56:25.700 --> 56:35.358
star six to unmute. Jill saba

56:35.374 --> 56:37.880
Blanding. If Jill's in, we'll come back to you.

56:46.640 --> 56:50.304
I had a couple of questions, but I believe what Jason speaking

56:50.342 --> 56:54.256
to is the fact that last year we were able to

56:54.438 --> 56:58.640
direct our questions to the department heads during the budget workshops.

57:00.260 --> 57:03.172
I don't know if that was a change because it was virtual, but we definitely

57:03.226 --> 57:06.676
had the opportunity last year, so I can't speak to

57:06.698 --> 57:10.356
prior years. Thank you. We did a lot of

57:10.378 --> 57:13.328
different things during COVID when everyone was virtual.

57:13.504 --> 57:17.044
So maybe we just need to go back to everything being virtual.

57:17.092 --> 57:20.296
I'm not a big fan of that, but you're right, we did a lot of

57:20.318 --> 57:24.036
different things last year in a virtual environment

57:24.148 --> 57:27.564
because of that. Yeah, it was really nice and I

57:27.602 --> 57:30.632
appreciated it as a constituent, I don't disagree.

57:30.776 --> 57:34.716
In past workshops, we've been told that we start every day behind based

57:34.738 --> 57:38.156
on low budget for staffing. And so in regards to trash, where are

57:38.178 --> 57:41.536
we in terms of the routes we have versus the routes we need based on

57:41.558 --> 57:45.276
population growth? I believe there's a little bit of an addressing

57:45.308 --> 57:50.272
routes, but just some more details there. And then actually,

57:50.326 --> 57:52.210
several council members address this.

57:53.700 --> 57:57.028
Do you mind if I ask a quick question? Go ahead. Okay, so we've been

57:57.034 --> 58:00.464
told in the past that solid waste needs somewhere around 40 million for additional personnel

58:00.512 --> 58:03.764
and equipment to get up to basic adequate level of service. Okay,

58:03.802 --> 58:06.648
so just updates on that need for the immediate future.

58:06.734 --> 58:09.976
Council Member Alcorn and Pollard, you both brought up the

58:09.998 --> 58:13.256
discussion of fees for solid waste. I'm just curious how this could be

58:13.278 --> 58:17.132
applied equitably so that every Houstonian has access to trash collection and

58:17.186 --> 58:21.064
recycling because illegal dumping

58:21.112 --> 58:25.676
is already an issue. And so just everyone having access to trash and

58:25.698 --> 58:28.210
then, yeah, that's it.

58:29.540 --> 58:33.810
Council Member Pollard so I think we have to really

58:34.420 --> 58:37.696
strategically look at how we put forth the fee. What does that

58:37.718 --> 58:41.552
fee get you? How is it equal across the board, especially when it comes

58:41.606 --> 58:45.076
to those who may have resources and those who

58:45.098 --> 58:48.390
may not. So that's a discussion that we need to have

58:48.840 --> 58:51.764
before I think we do anything with the fee. I think we really need to

58:51.802 --> 58:55.608
educate the voters and the constituents on

58:55.694 --> 58:59.290
what's done in other cities. What can be expected here in this city?

58:59.660 --> 59:03.880
What are the pros? Maybe some of the cons and some of the realistic expectations,

59:04.540 --> 59:08.252
but it is a conversation that we need to have and we really

59:08.306 --> 59:11.832
need to be able to hear your voice on that when we bring forth

59:11.896 --> 59:15.070
what the possibilities are.

59:16.080 --> 59:19.884
But we are the only city, major city in the state of Texas

59:19.932 --> 59:23.744
and maybe even in the US. That does not have that fee. And so

59:23.782 --> 59:26.924
we have to find ways in which, if we do pay a fee,

59:27.052 --> 59:31.392
all communities get a benefit and see a benefit beyond

59:31.456 --> 59:35.076
just normal trash, but also looking into the

59:35.098 --> 59:38.580
uniqueness of each area, whether it's illegal dumping or

59:38.650 --> 59:41.830
whatever, to address those needs as well.

59:43.320 --> 59:47.524
So I'll give you my personal deal. I get my trash

59:47.572 --> 59:50.984
picked up by a contractor. I'm one of the folks that we

59:51.022 --> 59:54.524
get $6 a month from the city not to pick up our

59:54.562 --> 59:58.188
trash. That goes to our homeowners association, who in turn

59:58.274 --> 1:00:01.896
pays for the private trash collection. We have what's

1:00:01.928 --> 1:00:05.624
called back door driveway trash collection.

1:00:05.672 --> 1:00:08.776
So they go down the street and they roll up to your driveway and empty

1:00:08.808 --> 1:00:12.384
your can and dump it into a bigger can. Then the truck comes

1:00:12.422 --> 1:00:16.092
behind it, and we get that two days a week. Ours comes Tuesday, Friday.

1:00:16.236 --> 1:00:19.040
We have recycles pick up every Thursday.

1:00:19.380 --> 1:00:22.660
So we are very happy with our

1:00:22.810 --> 1:00:25.956
trash collection. So if we do go to our garbage fee and

1:00:25.978 --> 1:00:29.972
we have to change it, we better do equal or

1:00:30.026 --> 1:00:33.000
better, or I will get more complaints,

1:00:33.420 --> 1:00:37.256
more complaints under the sun than I care to deal with.

1:00:37.438 --> 1:00:40.856
But one of the things that we had an

1:00:40.878 --> 1:00:44.936
issue with five, six years ago I forgot when it

1:00:44.958 --> 1:00:48.824
was, was when we started looking at the elimination of private

1:00:48.872 --> 1:00:52.664
trash collection. We realized we didn't have the people and we didn't have the equipment

1:00:52.712 --> 1:00:56.360
to do it. So I'm not sure what Sally Alcorn

1:00:56.440 --> 1:01:00.072
has to say over there, but we love our private trash collection,

1:01:00.136 --> 1:01:04.784
and we pay for it, and we're glad to pay for it. So if

1:01:04.822 --> 1:01:08.016
I have to sit here and vote for a garbage fee, and I argued with

1:01:08.038 --> 1:01:11.696
Harry Hayes for years about it, it's going to be tough

1:01:11.728 --> 1:01:15.124
for me to do that, because what we

1:01:15.162 --> 1:01:17.670
have works extremely well.

1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:23.104
All of the cities that I mentioned earlier on all of the cities

1:01:23.152 --> 1:01:26.264
that have the fee, you can opt out of the fee and keep your

1:01:26.302 --> 1:01:30.196
private trash. Nobody's going to make anybody who has private trash

1:01:30.308 --> 1:01:34.104
get city trash. Can I quote you on that, Mayor? Mayor Al

1:01:34.142 --> 1:01:37.756
Corn because there's only one person that can state that, and he's up one

1:01:37.778 --> 1:01:41.484
floor. Well, a fee that I would support

1:01:41.682 --> 1:01:44.984
would not require people to give up their private

1:01:45.032 --> 1:01:48.904
trash. Let's quote let's run that tape back, broderick.

1:01:48.952 --> 1:01:52.668
Mr. Butler. Stop it. You got any additional

1:01:52.844 --> 1:01:56.048
yeah. And I appreciate Council Member Pollard address this I'm not

1:01:56.054 --> 1:01:59.824
worried about the constituents that can't afford the fee. I'm worried about those where,

1:01:59.862 --> 1:02:03.444
like, every dollar is in

1:02:03.482 --> 1:02:06.756
them being able to access trash and recycling, because we don't want

1:02:06.778 --> 1:02:10.676
to see that go there. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I will

1:02:10.698 --> 1:02:13.808
not be here tomorrow, so thanks for coming for every meeting.

1:02:13.904 --> 1:02:17.208
Thank you. Stick around. I'll talk

1:02:17.214 --> 1:02:20.840
to you a little bit. Broad Butler, Northeast Houston,

1:02:22.220 --> 1:02:25.464
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina does

1:02:25.502 --> 1:02:28.536
an excellent job of eliminating illegal dumping. I wish

1:02:28.568 --> 1:02:31.356
you would take a look at their plan. It went all the way to the

1:02:31.378 --> 1:02:35.404
state level. They have an agreement between the city and

1:02:35.442 --> 1:02:38.796
the state to deal with illegal dumping.

1:02:38.908 --> 1:02:42.844
But my comments are I want to apologize for losing my composure

1:02:42.892 --> 1:02:46.076
earlier. I respect the decision. I didn't expect you to reverse

1:02:46.108 --> 1:02:49.552
it. But to sit here and be told.

1:02:49.606 --> 1:02:53.396
That well compensated, educated and seasoned directors are

1:02:53.418 --> 1:02:56.448
being shielded from. Speaking to the public is frustrating.

1:02:56.544 --> 1:03:00.144
But I apologize to the entire council for letting my passions

1:03:00.192 --> 1:03:04.090
get the better of me. I'd like to acknowledge the

1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:07.828
solid waste department on our side of town in Northeast Houston.

1:03:07.924 --> 1:03:11.624
Alice Coffey, Richard Wynn, and Desmond Allen are

1:03:11.662 --> 1:03:15.076
names that all Northeast residents know. They have worked

1:03:15.118 --> 1:03:18.028
harder. When they have failed, they have stepped up.

1:03:18.114 --> 1:03:21.756
And everything that the director told you

1:03:21.778 --> 1:03:25.496
about, we already know as citizens because we have a communication

1:03:25.608 --> 1:03:29.520
and a dialogue with their staff. So outside

1:03:29.590 --> 1:03:33.276
of that, I wish every city department would resemble the solid

1:03:33.308 --> 1:03:36.556
waste staff department. And again, Myrtle Beach,

1:03:36.588 --> 1:03:40.836
South Carolina. So do you know anything about what they do? Because we

1:03:40.858 --> 1:03:44.884
talk about yeah, I read the whole plan one

1:03:44.922 --> 1:03:48.196
night when I was running for city council. Would you run

1:03:48.218 --> 1:03:52.352
against I have no idea. But they were victorious,

1:03:52.496 --> 1:03:55.520
and we're going to go with it because in my eyes today,

1:03:55.610 --> 1:03:58.996
they stood 10ft tall. And I'll say that again, so I'm very proud

1:03:59.028 --> 1:04:02.600
of them. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. All I did one night, I said,

1:04:02.750 --> 1:04:06.056
everybody's got a thought on this. And then I just went to the Google machine

1:04:06.088 --> 1:04:09.160
and I said, give me the best solution for illegal dumping.

1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:12.392
It said, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Their economy

1:04:12.456 --> 1:04:15.516
depends on tourism. For people to come to

1:04:15.538 --> 1:04:19.068
this wonderful clear beach in South Carolina.

1:04:19.244 --> 1:04:22.784
But they had an economic downturn and all this

1:04:22.822 --> 1:04:26.336
trash showed up. Nobody wanted tourists to come and

1:04:26.358 --> 1:04:30.116
see a filthy city. They were going to lose millions of dollars.

1:04:30.298 --> 1:04:33.380
They came up with a garbage fee. It was $3.

1:04:33.450 --> 1:04:36.580
Ended up being $11. The fee was

1:04:36.650 --> 1:04:40.230
specific to hire only a team

1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:44.596
along with their solid waste department. But that team

1:04:44.698 --> 1:04:48.264
only went out and removed illegal dumping. I thought it

1:04:48.302 --> 1:04:51.188
didn't make a lot of sense, but as I talked to residents here, they didn't

1:04:51.204 --> 1:04:54.856
care how it worked. They just want the trash gone. So Myrtle

1:04:54.888 --> 1:04:59.230
Beach created a standalone hot team.

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:03.404
That's all they did. They went throughout the entire city and

1:05:03.442 --> 1:05:06.396
removed trash, and it worked very well.

1:05:06.578 --> 1:05:10.112
Then the city went to the legislature and

1:05:10.166 --> 1:05:13.756
asked them to increase the fines for people who did illegal

1:05:13.788 --> 1:05:16.864
dumping. So they had to buy in from the state,

1:05:16.982 --> 1:05:19.728
the county, and the state legislature. Sorry,

1:05:19.894 --> 1:05:23.596
the city, the county, and the state legislature. So that if you

1:05:23.638 --> 1:05:27.056
did dump in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, you were going to do jail

1:05:27.088 --> 1:05:30.452
time and you were going to lose a whole lot of money. And so

1:05:30.586 --> 1:05:34.884
now Myrtle Beach is again, they have one of the best responses

1:05:34.932 --> 1:05:38.328
to the issue, which is basically, you come here,

1:05:38.414 --> 1:05:41.736
you dump, you will either go to jail or you

1:05:41.758 --> 1:05:44.730
will be fined into the Stone Age.

1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:48.456
And it has worked well for them. I'm looking it up right now, and it's

1:05:48.488 --> 1:05:51.896
interesting. A lot of our issues emanates

1:05:51.928 --> 1:05:55.804
from the state of texas. And the reason why I say that is we

1:05:55.842 --> 1:05:59.616
have a problem not with illegal dumping, but with sand mining operations. And we

1:05:59.638 --> 1:06:03.692
discovered that it was less expensive for them to keep illegally

1:06:03.836 --> 1:06:07.808
sending sand into our tributaries than it is to remediate it.

1:06:07.894 --> 1:06:10.896
So they kept doing it and they kept paying the fines and they paid them

1:06:10.918 --> 1:06:14.864
gladly. But you won't solve that problem until you raise the fines

1:06:14.912 --> 1:06:18.496
high enough to where it actually hurts them. And it sounds like reading

1:06:18.528 --> 1:06:22.164
on Myrtle Beach that's exactly what they did through the state.

1:06:22.282 --> 1:06:26.104
And they got the buy in so that they weren't a standalone island trying

1:06:26.142 --> 1:06:29.336
to solve a problem that other cities were eventually going to have

1:06:29.358 --> 1:06:32.948
in South Carolina. Right. Well, I'll finish reading it, but your other comment

1:06:33.044 --> 1:06:37.164
no need to apologize. I appreciate your

1:06:37.202 --> 1:06:40.824
vigor and vitality. I think I'm somewhat

1:06:40.872 --> 1:06:43.996
like that. Well, but reason people should be able

1:06:44.018 --> 1:06:47.468
to have a discourse because at the end of the day, some of

1:06:47.474 --> 1:06:50.704
these directors, they don't deal with apparati, they deal

1:06:50.742 --> 1:06:53.936
with people's lives. So it kind of matters to us

1:06:54.038 --> 1:06:56.850
that we're the lives they might be dealing with one day.

1:06:57.220 --> 1:07:00.924
Thank you. We appreciate the efforts of the council

1:07:01.052 --> 1:07:03.908
and thank you for your time. You got it. Thank you.

1:07:04.074 --> 1:07:07.972
Before we adjourn, please note budget workshops will continue this week

1:07:08.026 --> 1:07:11.940
through Thursday, May 19. Our next budget presentation will be special called

1:07:12.010 --> 1:07:16.596
BFA committee meeting tomorrow, Thursday the 19th at 09:00

1:07:16.708 --> 1:07:19.640
A.m.. I will be out.

1:07:19.710 --> 1:07:23.252
