1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,726
The fire department presentations. Reminder to council members you

2
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:11,386
should submit any department budget workshop questions in a word document

3
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:15,194
and upload it to SharePoint budget workspace.

4
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:19,070
Departments have been directed to provide responses within 48 hours

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,814
of the conclusion of their presentations. Department responses will

6
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:26,274
also be uploaded to SharePoint. We will now hear from Chief Pena,

7
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:29,954
who will provide the fire Department budget. Chief floor is yours.

8
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:33,606
Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. First of all, I want

9
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:36,806
to thank you. I want to thank the committee members for allowing me to

10
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,714
present the Houston Fire Department's proposed fiscal year 2023

11
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:43,866
budget. Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge some of

12
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:47,850
my civilian staff and of course, my command staff for

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,454
the assistance that they provided in preparing this budget. With me.

14
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:55,226
I have the Houston Fire Department's department fiscal

15
00:00:55,258 --> 00:00:58,862
administrator, Ms. Rochelle McHenry. I also have members

16
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:02,746
of my command staff here. Chief west and Chief McLeod are joining

17
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:06,210
us. But the thanks

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,602
goes to all our staff who really have been

19
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:12,846
doing tremendous work. I also want to acknowledge and thank Mayor

20
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:16,818
Turner and this council for giving me the support this year and the finances

21
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:20,614
to provide the needs for this

22
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:23,910
organization. The Houston Fire Department is

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,138
the third largest municipal fire department, protecting the fourth

24
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,514
largest city in the country. And my hat

25
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:33,286
goes off to the men and women of the Houston Fire Department for the incredible

26
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:36,250
work that they do each and every day. It's an active system,

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,562
just like any major city. We run about 344,000

28
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:43,226
calls for service each year. We're still dealing with

29
00:01:43,248 --> 00:01:47,230
the effects of the pandemic and working

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,718
through some very challenging times. But I cannot say enough about the work that the

31
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:54,066
men and women of the Houston Fire Department do to ensure the safety of this

32
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:57,380
community. So very proud of the work that they do.

33
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,060
First slide, please.

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,226
So the proposed fiscal year 2023 budget for the

35
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:09,160
Houston Fire Department is $559,000,000.

36
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,782
This will be funding 3933.3

37
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:17,746
FTEs in six funds. The distribution of the funds and

38
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:22,118
the personnel are displayed here in six key areas.

39
00:02:22,214 --> 00:02:26,342
And as you can see, the major funding is for personnel

40
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:30,490
that is allocated to the emergency response program. Next slide.

41
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,958
Our primary function and mission is the protection of lives and property

42
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:40,798
of our residents. Our goal is to accomplish this primarily through

43
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:45,122
prevention, code enforcement and investigations. But we do

44
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:49,534
spend a lot of money to train and prepare for responses to emergency

45
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:52,574
medical calls, fire calls, hazmat,

46
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:56,134
technical rescue, aircraft rescue, and a variety of other

47
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,070
programs. Next slide.

48
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,834
The legal provisions that guide our agency and approve

49
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:08,230
programs and services for our department are listed here on this slide.

50
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,714
I do want to highlight the last bullet point in the anticipation of

51
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:15,622
increased demand in service for our department.

52
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:19,818
This is particularly going to be in the area of emergency medical services.

53
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:23,422
The population growth, and especially the aging population will drive

54
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:27,710
up the need for our services. The same thing will occur with

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,162
the aging infrastructure as it relates to fire response.

56
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:34,834
So it is critical, and it's more important now more than

57
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:38,638
ever that we maintain focus of adopting

58
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:42,126
appropriate fire codes and enforcement tools to maintain

59
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,980
the desired quality of life here in the city. Next slide, please.

60
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,914
So, as we move on to the financials of our presentation, this first slide

61
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:54,806
summarizes the department's revenue projections for the general fund.

62
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:58,370
In fiscal year 23, we're projecting a slight increase in the

63
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,430
majority of our regular operating revenue streams.

64
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,194
This is going to be offset by a larger decrease in three

65
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:08,474
specific revenue accounts. So the overall net effect

66
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:12,974
for our revenues is a decrease of 7.73%,

67
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:17,070
or $8.9 million, from fiscal year 22 to fiscal year

68
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,506
23. For our department, the revenue

69
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:24,846
is derived primarily from licensings and permits intergovernmental

70
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:28,226
revenue. This is in

71
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:31,730
addition to charges for services or ambulance transports.

72
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,826
Direct inner funds. This is the money that we receive from Haas for personnel

73
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:40,070
assigned to the airport stations. The miscellaneous

74
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,754
item, the category, is primarily the reimbursement

75
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:48,650
for our special operations teams and their deployments.

76
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,630
So licenses and permits are essentially flat.

77
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,210
This year is our projection with a slight increase in the expected fire permit revenue.

78
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,318
We're also projecting a 39% reduction in the

79
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:05,086
intergovernmental category due to an increase primarily to

80
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:09,034
the amount of money we're going to receive from the ambulance supplemental

81
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:12,986
payment program. And I'll explain more in a later slide.

82
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:16,626
The charges for service increase is primarily due to the

83
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:20,654
expected increase in Hazmat permits, which will bring us back to the pre pandemic

84
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:24,386
revenue figures. This is going to be offset against a

85
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:28,630
decrease in cell phone revenue towers. This is

86
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,166
the lease money that we get from Verizon for allowing them to

87
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:34,550
put their cell towers on the fire stations.

88
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,214
In the direct interfund services, this is the chargeback

89
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:43,690
for Haas. Again, for airport firefighters, the change

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,926
reflects a 6% base pay raise offset

91
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,354
against a lower pension rate for this account,

92
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,926
for other fines and forfeits the amount from fiscal year

93
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:58,394
22 is essentially flat. In the miscellaneous

94
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:02,106
and other categories, the change from budget to estimate is a decrease

95
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:05,778
of ten point 43%.

96
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:09,486
This is going to be primarily due to an expected decrease in the natural disaster

97
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:12,866
reimbursement. Again, for for deployments in fiscal year 21

98
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:16,066
and 22, the tactical deployment of

99
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:19,906
the Texas Task Force One members. They were deployed

100
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:23,126
higher than normal, and we don't expect the same number of

101
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:26,706
deployments this fiscal year. In other resources, we captured

102
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:30,154
the revenue associated with the Enterprise Light duty lease program

103
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:34,058
for our light duty vehicles, and I have a slide that will

104
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:38,154
go more in depth a little bit later. So again,

105
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:41,594
the fiscal year 23 projection revenue of $107.4

106
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:45,582
million is approximately 7.73% less

107
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:49,246
than fiscal year 2022s. Again, I want

108
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:53,330
to stress the point that this is mainly due to the ambulance supplemental payment program

109
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,006
which will be reduced, and I'll explain more on this. Next slide,

110
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,146
please. So,

111
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:04,366
as mentioned, the supplemental reimbursement program is expected

112
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:07,240
to drop by about $9.5 million.

113
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,618
This fund provides for the reimbursement for care, for Medicaid

114
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:15,302
and indigent care patients. So as of October 1,

115
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:19,270
2019, the uncompensated care program transitioned

116
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,046
to a charity care pool. This change eliminated

117
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:25,660
the Medicaid shortfall supplemental program,

118
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,102
and it redefined it as an uninsured cost to charity

119
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:34,000
care cost. Okay. That's the significant change.

120
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,366
This required agencies to

121
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:41,998
have a charity care policy in place. The first

122
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:45,714
year, very few providers were able to get that policy in place.

123
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,506
The Houston Fire Department. The City of Houston actually did. So we were one

124
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:53,026
of the few participants in the pool. This second year,

125
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,546
more providers are able to have that policy in place.

126
00:07:56,648 --> 00:08:00,166
So we have more agencies competing with

127
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,638
the same pool. So the number

128
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:07,154
of dollars in the pool did not increase, but the number of participants

129
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:10,970
did. So the disbursement was a little less to every

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,698
provider. That's essentially the high level explanation on

131
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:18,374
why we're getting a lower return this year. Next slide,

132
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:19,020
please.

133
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,634
Okay. This is the Vehicle Lease

134
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:30,074
program. So this program has allowed us to do a wholesale

135
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:33,378
replacement of our vehicles, the light duty vehicles, primarily in

136
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:37,266
the Life Safety Bureau, and we are in

137
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:41,300
the first replacement cycle for that program.

138
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,518
The program we incorporated 105 vehicles in the

139
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:49,830
lease program this year.

140
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,362
We were supposed to sell that one year old vehicle,

141
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:57,094
105 of them, and get new vehicles. The money that was

142
00:08:57,132 --> 00:09:00,486
realized from that sale was going to go back reprogrammed

143
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:04,106
into the program. Because of supply chain issues, we were

144
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:07,434
only able to sell 49 vehicles. So,

145
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:12,878
as you can see, the disbursement was $563,000

146
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:16,654
for those vehicles. Enterprise what they did is they gave

147
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,058
us 65% of the equity

148
00:09:20,154 --> 00:09:23,454
in those vehicles. They paid it out this year for next

149
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:26,834
fiscal year, we will sell again those 49

150
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:30,594
one year old vehicles, plus 56 vehicles that now will

151
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:34,654
be two years old. And we'll realize only the 35% equity

152
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:40,150
that was left over. That's the reason for the change

153
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,958
in the revenue. But essentially, as you

154
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:46,070
can see, the first year we realized,

155
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,162
to the benefit of the city is $391,000.

156
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:55,900
We replaced 105 vehicles. The program really,

157
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,834
it was essentially cost neutral. Matter of fact, the city

158
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:03,562
was reimbursed an additional 395 or $91,000

159
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:07,374
fiscal year 23. Our projection is going to be about half

160
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:10,698
of that. Again, because of the explanation that I gave earlier, we're selling

161
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:14,562
two euro vehicles instead of €1 vehicles. After this year,

162
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:18,386
we will be back on track to sell, replace 105,

163
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:22,370
and sell 105 every year. Next slide.

164
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,366
These are expenditures by funds. The proposed expenditure target for

165
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:32,278
fiscal year 23 is $559,000,000,

166
00:10:32,444 --> 00:10:36,166
which represents an increase of 20.3 million from

167
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:40,134
the current budget of $538.7 million.

168
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:43,834
The increase by category and personnel cost

169
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:47,114
is a net of several increases including civilian and

170
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:50,394
classified base and related fringes, as well as

171
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:54,426
classified overtime and classified health. This will be offset against a decrease

172
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,914
in the classified pension and classified workers

173
00:10:57,962 --> 00:11:01,386
comp cost. A 10.9% increase

174
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:05,218
in supplies is due to an increase in cost of doing business,

175
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:08,974
primarily in drugs, medical surgical supplies,

176
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,946
as well as a small increase for the GL account for the

177
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:16,354
fifth Academy class that we were approved for this

178
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:20,582
coming fiscal year. Contributing to the overall 3.77%

179
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:24,694
growth is an increase in our restricted accounts of eleven point

180
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:28,914
61%. This is the Interfund chargeback accounts for

181
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:32,380
It for HR, fuel and fleet services.

182
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,962
And lastly, an increase in our service account of $958,000

183
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:41,486
is a transfer of funds from GST for the payment of our

184
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:44,110
lease for our building, for our headquarters.

185
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,866
This is in addition to that, it's an increase in other inner

186
00:11:47,898 --> 00:11:51,722
fund services for payments of It service personnel.

187
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:55,726
Contractual increases which will be offset again by a decreasing

188
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:59,314
in billing and collection expenditure from our

189
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:02,866
medical biller because of the reduced amount in the

190
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,700
ASPP fund, the ambulance supplemental plan.

191
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,134
The equipment fund change is due to not requiring us

192
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:13,314
to invest this year for items that were purchased in fiscal

193
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:17,186
year 21 and 22. In 21 we purchased some surface

194
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:21,114
pro tablets, some related equipment, some desktops and

195
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:24,870
three thermal imagers. In fiscal year 22, those expenditures

196
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,282
were directed towards extrication equipment, jobs of life

197
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:31,914
and those types of equipment. We will not have to make that purchase

198
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:34,480
this year. That's the reason for the change.

199
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,346
As far as the explanation for the Debt services fund, in fiscal

200
00:12:40,378 --> 00:12:44,722
year 21, $53,000 was transferred from Fund 1000 to

201
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:48,066
Fund 40 515. This was done for the

202
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:51,620
purchase of drone equipment for our tactical deployment team.

203
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,478
We ran out of time actually to get that purchase done before the

204
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:59,446
end of the fiscal year. So we did receive approval to transfer

205
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:03,266
the funds that were allocated from District G's

206
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,886
service funds to

207
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:10,554
Fund 40 515. That way we wouldn't lose that budget. That's the

208
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:14,538
explanation for that. Next slide please. So this

209
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,754
is how our funds are allocated. Of the fiscal year 23

210
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:21,280
budget, 88% is allocated to Personnel services.

211
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,022
This leaves a total operating budget of $69.5

212
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:29,390
million, of which 63% or

213
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,882
45 point or $43.5 million is

214
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:36,414
in restricted accounts. This is for HR.

215
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:39,170
Interfunds fleet interfunds and so on.

216
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,690
17% is in the other category. This is for

217
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,310
certain contracts, our telemetry contract and other service

218
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,458
contracts. 6% is allocated for our billing

219
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:52,786
and collections agency, which leaves

220
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:56,486
us approximately $10.2 million annually to cover

221
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:59,462
medical supplies, to cover personal protective equipment,

222
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:03,018
firefighting equipment and other supplies needed for the operation of

223
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:06,460
this organization. Next slide please.

224
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,682
So this slide walks us through the changes from fiscal year 22 current

225
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:16,266
budget to fiscal year 2023 proposed budget. Our fiscal

226
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:20,302
year 22 current budget is $538.7 million,

227
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:24,350
of which 36.8 million is in restricted accounts.

228
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,874
The 22 current budget figure of 538

229
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:30,930
is a net adjustment for fiscal year 22.

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,654
Hope contractual adjustments. It includes restricted accounts

231
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:38,002
increases of $2.2 million, some health benefit

232
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:41,794
returns of $3.8 million, and a city council surplus

233
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:45,874
dollars of $29,000. Other operating contractual adjustments

234
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:49,194
of 4.7 million includes one time adjustments for

235
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:52,982
workers compensation increases, overtime expenditures,

236
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,902
which are then offset by classified and cadet vacancy savings.

237
00:14:56,966 --> 00:15:00,446
So the total adjustment, the one time adjustment for this is

238
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:04,462
$3.3 million. So to go from 22 to

239
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:08,154
23 budget, we have incremental increases and decreases in operating

240
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:11,550
and contractually mandated expenses.

241
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,066
And I'll explain here. So coming back into the budget is

242
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:20,686
$2.75 million for our fifth academy class that was approved

243
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,126
funding for a 6% across the board pay raise

244
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:27,926
for classified personnel, other classified adjustments of $2.4

245
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:31,302
million for base overtime, a return

246
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:35,346
of the council surplus dollars, and a reversal of the one time operating adjustments

247
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:39,354
for a total of three. I'm sorry. $21.3 million in

248
00:15:39,392 --> 00:15:42,938
adjustments or a 4.26 increase from

249
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:46,460
FY 22 to FY 23.

250
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,982
The contractual obligations include the following hope

251
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:55,694
obligations contractual obligations adjustments for

252
00:15:55,732 --> 00:16:00,122
civilian and classified health, civilian and classified pension and FICA

253
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:03,070
and other funding or restricted accounts,

254
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,742
contract, Escalations, and other contractual adjustments. So the subtotal

255
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:12,306
of contractual obligations is -920 $6,000,

256
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:16,722
which is largely the result of savings related to the reduction in the classified pension

257
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:20,482
rate, the operating contractual obligation

258
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,514
adjustments of $20.3 million, which takes us to our fiscal

259
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:28,442
year 23 proposed budget of $559,000,000,

260
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:32,074
or a 3.77% increase from 20. Two's current

261
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:34,646
budget. Next slide,

262
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:37,514
please. So,

263
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:41,702
these are the highlights of the materials we just covered. Of additional

264
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:45,594
focus, I'd like to mention the five non certified

265
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:49,562
cadet training classes for a total of 350 new hires

266
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:53,558
for fiscal year 23, and the cost associated

267
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:57,166
for the continuation of three non certified classes,

268
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:59,620
which were begun this fiscal year.

269
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,886
In addition to that is a grant match for the AFG grant

270
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:07,394
to provide training and physicals with cancer screenings

271
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:11,346
for firefighters and also the completion of our vehicle exhaust installation.

272
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,398
That grant matches approximately $309,000.

273
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:18,406
And then

274
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:21,660
we discussed the other ones already. So next slide, please.

275
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,260
That is my presentation vice Chair. I am open for any questions.

276
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,306
Thank you, Chief, for your presentation, I'm going to start with questions from Council member

277
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:34,990
Abby Cayman. Thank you so much, Vice Chair.

278
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,974
Chief, thank you for not only to you, to your

279
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:42,394
executive team command all the way on down. It's a privilege

280
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:46,066
to work with you all. Thank you. Few quick questions. As I said,

281
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,050
I'm asking this of every department.

282
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,846
Given the budgetary and financial constraints that the city continues

283
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:57,270
to face due to revenue limitations,

284
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,880
what can we not afford right now

285
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,198
that's needed? That's not to say that mayor and

286
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:10,250
council is not trying to approve everything that we can, but there are significant

287
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,238
large budget items that are necessary that we, quite frankly, can't afford.

288
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:18,506
Such as I'll say it, and I know council Member Peck will probably

289
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:22,986
raise it. CAD I'm looking back in the appendix

290
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:26,778
diesel exhaust removal for some of our stations.

291
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:31,440
Are there other things that we need to be

292
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,986
talking about that we cannot necessarily afford right

293
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:39,714
now? Council Member the answer to that question

294
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:43,506
is definitely a yes. You mentioned technology is

295
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:47,374
a critical need for our organization. The computer aided

296
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:51,106
dispatcher CAD system needs complete replacement

297
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:54,566
on that. We're working with almost a 20 year old system, and there are

298
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:57,866
a lot of things that we could be doing to create efficiencies within the

299
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:01,834
organization that are not possible because of the age of that

300
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:05,718
program. One of them is dispatching by location,

301
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,594
vehicle location, text to 911.

302
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:12,982
All those priority dispatch systems,

303
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:16,110
all those things that we can explore are

304
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,086
a little bit more difficult because of the age of that system. So technology is

305
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:23,202
one of them. The other needs are going to be primarily focused on training

306
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:26,770
and professional development for the members of the organization.

307
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,374
An increase in service capacity, primarily ambulance

308
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:34,514
and transport service capacity is what we need,

309
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,794
and there are a lot of needs for upgrades

310
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,030
in our facilities.

311
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,960
I need you to put me back in queue. I had one more question.

312
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,378
You have one more. Go ahead. Okay, thank you. And again, Chief, I do want

313
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:52,326
to congratulate you on in the department on the things you have accomplished.

314
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,054
Again, going back to the appendix, the increase

315
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:59,078
in pay, the Hazmat units,

316
00:19:59,174 --> 00:20:03,086
the following up on 100% of

317
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:06,222
cardiac arrest incidents, adoption of the fire code,

318
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:08,080
the lease vehicle program.

319
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,766
There's a lot in here that is absolutely

320
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:16,018
to be commended for. I do want to point out I continue when

321
00:20:16,024 --> 00:20:20,610
we look at the comparative gender and ethnicity statistics,

322
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,910
the very low level in terms of classified of

323
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,422
female employees. Yes. And that's it, I think

324
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:32,390
3.85% compared to 96.15%

325
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,942
in the largest population of

326
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:39,398
HFD employees. So I would just bring our attention to

327
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,986
that. In terms of recruitment, I know that there are recruitment challenges that we

328
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,986
continue to face, but I know that we

329
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:50,822
are striving to be as diverse as possible, and I see that reflected

330
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:54,606
in Y'all's efforts. But I just wanted to point that out that

331
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,382
we have more work to do there. And if you could really quickly touch base

332
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:01,642
on you kind of touched on it, but our inspection

333
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:04,942
capacity and our ambulance transport

334
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:08,462
capacity I know you just mentioned it, but inspection

335
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:12,306
capacity seems to be a pretty big need.

336
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:16,226
Yes, ma'am. Look, if we focus all our

337
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:19,314
attention and resources on just the emergency response,

338
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:22,454
we're never going to be able to keep up with demand. We're going to make

339
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:26,674
the biggest impact in our call volume and demand

340
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:29,260
if we prevent things from happening.

341
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,570
That speaks to our need to provide more inspections

342
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,646
for these commercial businesses. Having more inspectors

343
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:43,014
to ensure that the codes, when we're building, we're building appropriately

344
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:46,718
and up to code and having those eyes on scene to ensure that

345
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:50,250
we are meeting those codes because it's going to assist us downstream

346
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,422
in not having to respond to so many fires or major fires.

347
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:56,530
The same thing goes for medical response.

348
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,820
25% of our basic life support calls are

349
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,194
people that call more than once or twice per year.

350
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:10,306
Okay? And what we found is that those individuals don't

351
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:13,686
need the most expensive taxi to go to the most expensive part

352
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,174
of the Er. They need access to the right social service. Right. We have that

353
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:20,774
information. It's having resources to

354
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:24,666
focus on those social services and

355
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:28,186
making those connections with existing agencies that's going to

356
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,698
allow us to make a definite impact on the number of calls

357
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:35,374
that come in from repeat customers. Let me say it that way.

358
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:39,166
So certainly inspectors and then we

359
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:43,194
know that we have an increase in population and increase in aging population

360
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:47,006
and whether we like it or not, we are the medical safety

361
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,894
net for this community. So emergency medical transport

362
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:54,754
and ambulance service is what we need to focus on right now.

363
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:58,690
We're limited in our ability to increase that because of our staffing

364
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,360
situation. But strategically that's something that

365
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,390
we've discussed with the mayor and administration. The mayor is completely supportive

366
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,306
of doing that. We just need to fix the

367
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:13,500
staffing issue first and then we can move forward.

368
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,650
Chief, when looking at your presentation,

369
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,346
can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that you had an increase

370
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:27,310
in expenditures but a decrease in revenues.

371
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,490
Yes. What creative ways can we increase revenues

372
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,186
within the department? Other ways to increase revenues in

373
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,380
the department of course. Look, the major

374
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,170
revenue source is our charge for service and primarily

375
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,560
ambulance service.

376
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,930
We brought forth a recommendation for an ordinance,

377
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,280
an increase in the charge a couple of years ago.

378
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,850
That recommendation was based on data

379
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,580
that was already a couple of years old at that time.

380
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,882
Since then we've had an increase of 6%

381
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:11,366
pay raise last year. We are going to have

382
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:15,134
a 6% increase this coming year. And so the cost

383
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:19,294
of delivering service has gone up not only in personnel cost but

384
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,426
also the cost of supplies and materials.

385
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:26,466
In one particular drug that we use the

386
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:30,114
cost went up almost 90%. Right. And so everything

387
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:36,238
is going up. We are not recovering

388
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:39,782
what it cost us to deliver. So we need to another analysis, another study

389
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:43,734
to see what that rate would be. Second thing is

390
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:47,746
our payer mix is heavy medicare, Medicaid in

391
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:52,202
this community. And then we have a large percentage of self

392
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:56,778
pay which means no insurance. So our collection rate is about 39%

393
00:24:56,784 --> 00:24:57,740
to 40%.

394
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,370
At some point medicare or Medicaid is expanded.

395
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,106
We would have the ability to collect

396
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:13,940
more. Increasing the rate of

397
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:18,126
service cost or the charge

398
00:25:18,158 --> 00:25:22,158
for service would be one way because medicare and Medicaid they reimbursed

399
00:25:22,174 --> 00:25:25,686
at the usual and customary rate. We are

400
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:28,822
the big elephant in the room.

401
00:25:28,956 --> 00:25:32,162
We are the largest ambulance provider in this region,

402
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:35,800
so if we keep our rates arbitrarily low,

403
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,146
there is no incentive for that reimbursement

404
00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:44,086
for Medicare, Medicaid to be adjusted upward. So we have

405
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:47,442
to look at some of these things. I know it's a difficult conversation,

406
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:52,526
but again, the that is our

407
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:56,462
primary service provide or service

408
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:00,894
that we provide, where we get reimbursement from when

409
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:04,610
looking at other large cities around the country, how are we

410
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,918
as it relates to competitive salaries?

411
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:11,346
Well, look, all I can base it on is what we provide,

412
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:14,050
what we presented a year ago.

413
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,294
And that was based on a total comp study for

414
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:21,282
pay. And we were below the average,

415
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:25,554
about 18%. The mayor and council

416
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:28,850
approved us to increase the pay rate by

417
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,486
18% to try to help us get up to at least the median.

418
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:34,620
But every year,

419
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,602
the new contracts in other areas go up. There is

420
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:42,190
incentives and pay increases that happen. And so

421
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,550
we have to have a strategy to

422
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,830
be competitive.

423
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,918
Council member Amy Pitt. Thank you. And thank

424
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:55,822
you, Chief, for the presentation. You talked about

425
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:59,714
equipment purchased last year that we don't have to purchase this

426
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,914
year, and that's why that line item went down. Can you talk a little bit

427
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:06,142
about what's in the budget for just regular equipment,

428
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:09,826
like normal wear and tear, aging equipment, also equipment that's

429
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:13,430
stolen, like it was just stolen on engine four the other day,

430
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,320
that kind of thing? Yes.

431
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:20,506
I want to say it's unfortunate, but shrinkage is something that we experience as

432
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:24,106
well here in the department several times.

433
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:28,250
That was the most recent one. But we do experience

434
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,074
theft oftentimes. A lot of times it's our employees

435
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:35,886
who are the victims of that. At the fire stations, they have

436
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:39,722
their vehicles broken into. We do have monies

437
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:43,790
allocated council members for the MNO of our equipment.

438
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,238
Every year we try to anticipate a certain number of replacement.

439
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:52,050
We've taken a different approach in the last five years, starting from the

440
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,730
big ticket items like our apparatus.

441
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,966
We've gotten to the point where we are almost on

442
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:04,550
schedule to replace every one of our apparatus every ten years.

443
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,666
And so again, council and mayor, you all

444
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:11,786
have made a significant investment in allowing us

445
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:15,046
to get that plan implemented. But we've

446
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:18,406
taken the same approach for everything in our inventory.

447
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:22,918
Everything has a shelf life. Everything has a total life expectancy.

448
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:26,426
It needs to be replaced. It's easier to replace and take small bites

449
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:31,290
at the apple every year than to wait until we have to make wholesale replacements.

450
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,850
It's very hard to budget that way. So to answer your question is yes,

451
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,754
we do have a replacement plan for every

452
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:42,798
one of our items that we have in our inventory.

453
00:28:42,974 --> 00:28:46,514
Great. Thank you. The Vehicle Lease program.

454
00:28:46,632 --> 00:28:50,182
I love this program. Are we planning on expanding that past

455
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:54,230
the 105 vehicles? Yes. The answer is yes.

456
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,454
Our hope is that we're going to include all the arson vehicles and eventually

457
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:01,706
all the light duty vehicles. We're also

458
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:06,730
looking, and I'm working with staff to see if we can lease

459
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,440
the heavy apparatus for those stations that are

460
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,950
slowest in call volume.

461
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,818
So the plan is to take those apparatus,

462
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:23,454
take them off the board on the replacement plan, and put them into a lease

463
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:28,014
program until we can make some significant improvements

464
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:32,002
on the existing on the remaining ones, and then put them back into

465
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:34,580
slowly fold them back into the replacement plan.

466
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,314
One of the latest projections

467
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:42,838
was that I can get ten vehicles for a

468
00:29:42,844 --> 00:29:45,922
million dollars a year on a lease, ten apparatus.

469
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:50,114
And it would mean moving from CIP funding

470
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:53,400
to operating funds. But I think that's a

471
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,402
I mean, that's a proper use of government funds of city

472
00:29:57,456 --> 00:30:01,178
resources because it allows us to have one serviceable

473
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:05,230
equipment and two at a lower cost per year.

474
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,678
And so, yes, I'd like to expand it. The program

475
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:13,454
that we have in place now, I think the proof of concept

476
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:16,898
is that it works. As I

477
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:20,706
mentioned, at worst, we break even. But we have

478
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:24,626
brand new vehicles, one year old vehicles every year. And that not

479
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:27,978
only increases our efficiencies, but it improves morale.

480
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:31,398
We were running around with 1520 year old vehicles. A lot

481
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:35,494
of them didn't even have the latest safety equipment. So this

482
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:38,898
is a good program. I think it's good government. I think it's

483
00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:42,198
a responsible way of using city resources, and I'm hoping

484
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:45,498
to expand this program. Great. Thank you, chief and vice chair. If you

485
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,218
could put me back in the queue of another question. Thank you.

486
00:30:48,384 --> 00:30:51,966
Go ahead. My last question is,

487
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:55,726
is there anything that we should be funding for insurance or

488
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:59,194
accreditation reasons that we are not funding in this proposed

489
00:30:59,242 --> 00:30:59,950
budget?

490
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,694
Okay, I'm not understanding your question. I know that

491
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:08,542
there are certain things that we're supposed to like programs,

492
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:12,114
numbers, that kind of thing that we're supposed to be doing every year. Is there

493
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:15,106
something in the unmet needs that we should be doing? I mean,

494
00:31:15,128 --> 00:31:18,678
I know that everything is a need, but something that we could lose some kind

495
00:31:18,684 --> 00:31:22,326
of accreditation or insurance purposes that we should be

496
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:25,000
funding that we're not? Well, look,

497
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:29,314
we just got our ISO rating

498
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:32,506
for the city of Houston and the Houston Fire Department. It came

499
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:36,138
back as an ISO one, which is the highest level you can get.

500
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:39,494
We just received our accreditation from the Commission on Fire Accreditation

501
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:40,410
International.

502
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,806
We've met the requirements for those. But we do have

503
00:31:47,828 --> 00:31:52,302
to be looking at the increase in call volume and

504
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:55,538
what we're going to do about that. One of the things that we need is

505
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:58,866
additional transport units. And I've mentioned this before, not only

506
00:31:58,888 --> 00:32:02,094
in this budget presentation, but in other committee presentations.

507
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:06,630
We need more ambulances. Our response times for

508
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,990
those call volume or those call types is going to increase.

509
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,738
I don't know that we're at risk of losing any certification

510
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:18,346
or accreditation for that. But we certainly at some

511
00:32:18,368 --> 00:32:22,522
point, if we don't make a strategic effort to address

512
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:26,314
that, we won't be meeting the needs that the community is

513
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:29,686
expecting. And so increasing ambulance

514
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:33,920
capacity is one of the main things that we need to be looking at

515
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,870
inspections is another one. We need more inspectors.

516
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,394
Again, the biggest impact we're going to make is in the prevention side,

517
00:32:43,432 --> 00:32:46,770
not on the response side. So to do that, we need inspectors.

518
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:52,174
We'll now move into the public comment period of the hearing.

519
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:55,010
We have three virtual public speakers,

520
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,486
and the first one is Saba Blanding. Please press

star six to unmute. Saba Blanding.

522
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,634
Okay, yeah, you think I have this down

523
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:21,950
by now, but still a struggle.

524
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,520
Chief, you really actually already answered my first question,

525
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:31,150
but I'm going to ask it in case you wanted to expand.

526
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,246
And that was what do you need in order to better provide preventative

527
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,754
services? You mentioned increasing inspectors, and I was

528
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:42,274
also curious in regards to that, if it's primarily an issue

529
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:45,858
of staffing or training or both, and if there was any other

530
00:33:45,944 --> 00:33:49,574
needs you all had. And then along with that,

531
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:53,062
I'm curious, what preventative measures do you think the city

532
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:57,186
could take beyond what it currently exists to reduce the demand

533
00:33:57,218 --> 00:34:00,426
on your department on the response side? And I really appreciate you

534
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:04,054
bringing up the importance of prevention. So that's my primary

535
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:07,066
question. Thank you. Okay,

536
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:11,334
so in regards to the inspectors question, it's both

537
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:15,786
It's personnel and It's. Training in order to do fire inspections.

538
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:19,370
The Texas Commission on Fire Protection requires a certification

539
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:24,642
as a state inspector, and so that takes a little while

540
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:27,970
to train people up, but first we need personnel.

541
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,166
It's a combination of both. In regards

542
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:37,030
to what would help in

543
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,614
stemming the increased call volume. I think the

544
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,310
more a concerted effort

545
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,940
in a public safety message on the proper use of 911,

546
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,540
we have a lot of calls that

547
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,330
don't qualify as emergencies,

548
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,934
but people still use the 911 system for

549
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:05,966
things that really could be handled in a different way. So I

550
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:09,998
think we have some work to do in

551
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:15,614
providing information, providing a

552
00:35:15,652 --> 00:35:19,650
better way of communicating how to properly use

553
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,962
the 911 system because it's a busy system. As I mentioned,

554
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:26,450
we run close to 350,000 calls for service

555
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,814
every year, and that's just us. The 911

556
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:33,378
center receives a couple of million calls.

557
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:36,738
I'm not exactly sure what the number is, but for both police

558
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:42,586
and fire at the 911 center, and a

559
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:46,374
certain percentage of those calls wouldn't really qualify

560
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:49,690
as emergency, but we still have to respond to them,

561
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,254
and so that would be one

562
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:57,614
way to do that. Thank you. Our next

563
00:35:57,652 --> 00:36:00,270
virtual speaker is Mr. Jason Oliver.

564
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,570
Please press star six to unmute.

565
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,730
Hi, Chief.

566
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,670
I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned about pay.

567
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,886
You said that the 18% will bring.

568
00:36:18,908 --> 00:36:22,070
US up to the average from last

569
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,070
year. Right. So any raises

570
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,042
that departments or comparison departments have made last

571
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:35,834
year or this year or next year. Right. When we get

572
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:39,338
to the 18%, they'll be at 25

573
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:42,906
or 30%. Well, maybe not that far, but they'll be

574
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:46,142
significantly beyond whatever we end up at.

575
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:49,422
Is that correct? I do know, Mr.

576
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:53,778
Oliver, that the city of Houston is commissioning a comp

577
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:57,214
study for this year. It should be ready sometime

578
00:36:57,262 --> 00:37:00,706
this year, and we'll have a

579
00:37:00,728 --> 00:37:04,594
better target of where we stand in comparison to our

580
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:07,010
counterparts in our industry.

581
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,160
The 18% was much needed,

582
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,778
and it's a huge step in the right direction. I will wait for

583
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:21,114
the comp study to come up sometime this

584
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:24,374
year, and then we will make the case for additional pay raises

585
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:27,626
for our firefighters. But, look, it's retention and

586
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:31,420
recruitment is a practical concern for me.

587
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,906
We have to be competitive in our industry to maintain

588
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:40,318
the talent that we have here on the department. It costs us a lot of

589
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:44,654
money to train and recruit, and we want them to remain

590
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:48,226
on this department. So one way to do that is to

591
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:52,450
ensure that we're competitive in pay. And then one

592
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,310
last question about I know the

593
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,826
emergency center has come up kind of talking about how they're

594
00:37:59,858 --> 00:38:03,014
facing issues with pay,

595
00:38:03,212 --> 00:38:07,234
and the non emergency number response

596
00:38:07,362 --> 00:38:10,538
is a bit slow. Is that contributing to

597
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:13,898
what you're seeing in terms of the kind of

598
00:38:13,904 --> 00:38:17,466
oversaturation of 911 and fire calls that

599
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:20,410
you're responding to that aren't actual emergencies?

600
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,850
Yes. So the 911 center employs civilian call takers.

601
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,758
The initial call goes to that area.

602
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:33,614
Those are civilians. And then, depending on the needs of the caller,

603
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:37,570
whether it's fire medical, then it goes to the fire department.

604
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:41,250
Any law enforcement need goes to the police department. From there,

605
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,846
our dispatchers the second level

606
00:38:44,968 --> 00:38:48,310
once it gets past the call taker for the fire department are

607
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,094
classified personnel, and we are fully staffed in

608
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:55,494
that area.

609
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:59,510
But again, it's more of

610
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,394
a training, and we have to do a better job. We,

611
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:06,582
the emergency services, need to do a better job of communicating

612
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:10,470
and an educational approach

613
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,254
for our community on the proper use of the 911 system,

614
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:18,014
what's an emergency, what would not be considered an emergency, and then provide them the

615
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:21,806
resources on how else they can get their needs

616
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:24,594
addressed without necessarily calling 911.

617
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:29,102
So it's a more comprehensive approach

618
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,220
to that question.

619
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,662
Thank you. Our next virtual speaker is Mr.

620
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:37,750
Doug Smith.

621
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,920
Can you hear me? Yes.

622
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:48,054
Great. You just

623
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:51,418
said you received the top ratings from the two rating agencies, and I've heard in

624
00:39:51,424 --> 00:39:55,846
the past that the fire department is understaffed

625
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:59,370
and you could use a lot more people. And I'm wondering if

626
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,194
there's a concern that you could possibly lose those ratings

627
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:06,990
if you don't get the people you need. That's one question.

628
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,022
The second question on page three,

629
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:15,022
four of your report. It's the statistics, performance measures.

630
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:18,562
You don't have any response times for

631
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,018
first unit call response times for either

632
00:40:22,104 --> 00:40:25,990
EMS or fire, and I'm wondering why that is.

633
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,146
And also on that page, you talk about EMS incidents

634
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,746
and responses and fire incidents and responses,

635
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:37,566
and the responses are a lot higher than the incidents,

636
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:41,286
and I'm curious what the differentiation

637
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:45,002
is between those two. Okay,

638
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,540
Mr. Smith, you're going to have to repeat the second part of

639
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,590
your question, the first one in regards to staffing,

640
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:57,514
look, I've made several presentations to the Public Safety Committee.

641
00:40:57,562 --> 00:41:01,822
I made the same presentation last

642
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,478
year regarding when we presented our budget

643
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:08,642
regarding staffing in 2019 and 2020,

644
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:12,382
we missed our recruitment target by about 280

645
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:15,734
firefighters. That was as a result of Proposition B

646
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:19,026
passing and us having to cancel four academy

647
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:20,840
classes at that point.

648
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,426
That caused us to miss the recruitment

649
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:29,594
by 280 firefighters that year. By the time we

650
00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:33,658
started recruitment again, it was 18 months

651
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:36,454
without hiring a single firefighter.

652
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:40,150
And in that time, attrition continued.

653
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:44,062
The normal and annual attrition continued to happen in 2020,

654
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:47,994
we had higher than normal attrition. So that exacerbated

655
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:52,138
the issue. Since that time, we've been approved

656
00:41:52,234 --> 00:41:55,790
280 firefighters per year to be hired.

657
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,460
This year, the mayor approved the fifth class,

658
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,454
which puts us at 350 firefighters that we're

659
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:07,266
going to be hiring this fiscal year. That is,

660
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:10,854
in attempts to make up for what we lost in 2019 and

661
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:14,134
2020. Our normal annual attrition is about

662
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:18,290
170. That's retirements, that's resignations.

663
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:22,454
That's everything else about 170. We're having to hire

664
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:26,026
100 above and beyond the normal attrition to try to

665
00:42:26,048 --> 00:42:29,500
make up for what we lost again in 2019 and 2020.

666
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,794
But my most precious resource

667
00:42:33,862 --> 00:42:37,038
is the first year firefighter, because it takes about a year to

668
00:42:37,044 --> 00:42:40,366
get them recruited, to get them trained and get them out into the

669
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:43,866
stations. So it's a long process, and that's

670
00:42:43,898 --> 00:42:47,106
why it's taken us so long. It's going to take us several fiscal years to

671
00:42:47,128 --> 00:42:49,380
make up what we lost back then.

672
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,740
It is a concern for us. We are making up

673
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,742
that shortage by increasing our

674
00:42:58,796 --> 00:43:02,902
overtime budget numbers in order to bring in

675
00:43:03,036 --> 00:43:06,034
personnel to make up for those shortages.

676
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:09,446
But the goal is, the strategic goal is to get back up to

677
00:43:09,468 --> 00:43:13,434
full staffing, because at that point, it would allow me to make the

678
00:43:13,472 --> 00:43:17,354
additional ask for more ambulances and more inspectors and

679
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:20,330
more capacity to be able to service the increased demand.

680
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,474
If you can repeat your have the rating

681
00:43:24,522 --> 00:43:28,014
agencies indicated any concern about the fact that you

682
00:43:28,052 --> 00:43:32,160
are dough as you just described? Doug, is this your second question?

683
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:38,450
Well, it's related to the question you just answered,

684
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:43,620
but the second question relates to page

685
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,570
item three four, where you have your performance

686
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,442
measures and you don't have any targets

687
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:55,410
for first call response for either fire or EMS

688
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,780
in 2023. And then on that same page,

689
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,610
you talk about EMS incidents and responses and

690
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,626
fire incidents and responses, and responses are a

691
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:11,306
lot higher than the incidents. And I'm just wondering what's

692
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:14,894
the difference between those two. So the reason for that,

693
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:18,474
Doug, is we're switching to accreditation measures.

694
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:21,230
In the past, we were reporting averages.

695
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:25,246
The average means that half the time you're better, but half the time you're

696
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:28,930
worse. The accreditation measure now is

697
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,878
based on percentiles. The 90th percentile is what they're measuring.

698
00:44:32,974 --> 00:44:36,642
That gives a better picture

699
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:40,086
of your capacity and the

700
00:44:40,108 --> 00:44:43,400
type of service you're delivering. That's the reason for that change.

701
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:48,134
We're also looking at outcome based responses

702
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:51,974
instead of just simply showing

703
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,578
up in a certain amount of

704
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:58,986
time and stopping the clock. Again, that's the

705
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:03,166
reason right now that you're seeing a lot of first

706
00:45:03,348 --> 00:45:06,846
response units, ladder trucks, fire trucks, when you

707
00:45:06,868 --> 00:45:09,550
actually need a medical and EMS transport unit.

708
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,866
We haven't been tracking that appropriately.

709
00:45:13,898 --> 00:45:17,346
We're stopping the clock based on response times without really looking at

710
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:20,834
the outcome. That is going to provide me

711
00:45:20,872 --> 00:45:24,114
the analysis and the tools to make the case for those

712
00:45:24,152 --> 00:45:27,650
additional units that we desperately need.

713
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,186
I know we need more ambulances. That's the reason that we're sending

714
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:34,774
the first available unit. A lot of times they show up just

715
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:38,338
to stop the clock and then they're waiting for that ambulance and

716
00:45:38,364 --> 00:45:41,020
transport unit to arrive minutes later.

717
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,562
The answer to that is not adding more fire

718
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:49,526
trucks. It's adding more ambulance capacity, which will help the system. It'll improve

719
00:45:49,558 --> 00:45:53,214
the response times for transport and it

720
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:56,350
really will improve the working environment.

721
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:00,606
Thank you, Chief. And what about the incidents and

722
00:46:00,628 --> 00:46:03,200
response difference between those two?

723
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:05,440
What are you looking at?

724
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,868
Doug? I'm going to have to get back to you on that. I don't want

725
00:46:19,874 --> 00:46:23,516
to give you an answer off the fly. I got to see exactly what

726
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:26,864
you are asking about. And Mrs. Smith, if you want to

727
00:46:26,982 --> 00:46:31,196
submit any additional questions to District E at Houst Gov,

728
00:46:31,228 --> 00:46:33,520
we'll get back to you shortly.

729
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,792
I know and I appreciate it. Thank you all. Thank you.

730
00:46:37,846 --> 00:46:41,220
Thank you. We will now move into the in person

731
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:44,836
public comment period. Public speakers, please make your way to the

732
00:46:44,858 --> 00:46:48,228
podium after your name is called. We have one in person

733
00:46:48,314 --> 00:46:50,996
speaker. Mr. Butler,

734
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:52,410
please come forward.

735
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,096
Ms. McHenry, if you could please step back and

736
00:46:59,118 --> 00:47:02,510
he will be able to use your microphone and then you can come back.

737
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,510
Thank you.

738
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,004
Good morning. Good morning. You have two minutes for questions.

739
00:47:17,122 --> 00:47:20,368
Thank you. How are you? How are you, chief? Good to see you.

740
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:23,516
Mr. Brother, good to see you as well. My name is Broderick Butler and I'm

741
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:27,036
a resident of Cynic Wood neighborhood in northeast Houston,

742
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:31,136
which is District B. I'd like to thank the Chief for his leadership.

743
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:35,172
I have a few questions for him, but first a statement. I want him

744
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:38,724
to thank Al Bennett, who has made sure that my

745
00:47:38,762 --> 00:47:42,500
community has gotten carbon monoxide detectors and smoke detectors

746
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:46,808
and continues to do so recently. So my three questions are this.

747
00:47:46,974 --> 00:47:50,296
In a previous budget cycle chief, you mentioned to

748
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:53,596
this committee that you had a significant number of engines in your fleet that were

749
00:47:53,618 --> 00:47:57,176
in disrepair. You were waiting on new engines,

750
00:47:57,288 --> 00:48:00,108
and you were also seeking to technology,

751
00:48:00,274 --> 00:48:04,156
but you're also waiting to seek more training for

752
00:48:04,178 --> 00:48:07,856
your firefighters. You've addressed these points in some of the questions that were

753
00:48:07,878 --> 00:48:11,196
posed to you today. But again, the theme

754
00:48:11,228 --> 00:48:14,752
is, can you reiterate has any of these

755
00:48:14,806 --> 00:48:18,580
issues been addressed at this point? That's the first question. The second

756
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:22,032
question is, given that you have five incoming classes

757
00:48:22,096 --> 00:48:25,844
queued up, that's great news, but are you currently having

758
00:48:25,882 --> 00:48:29,456
trouble recruiting applicants within the Houston city limits?

759
00:48:29,568 --> 00:48:32,872
If so, what have you done to combat that? And the thought

760
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:36,408
is about increasing diversity, as one of the council members

761
00:48:36,494 --> 00:48:40,532
mentioned. And so these themes are sort of repetitive themes,

762
00:48:40,596 --> 00:48:44,540
but my last question actually deals with my specific community as

763
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:48,216
sort of the other ones overlay, and that is we're

764
00:48:48,248 --> 00:48:51,884
going in hurricane season and how many firehouses in

765
00:48:51,922 --> 00:48:56,096
Northeast? Houston, which is sort of north of

766
00:48:56,198 --> 00:49:00,512
610, east of 59. Specifically the seven 70

767
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:04,320
116 zip code have

768
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,920
water evacuation and water rescue equipment.

769
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,224
And from what I know, the Tidwell firehouse

770
00:49:12,272 --> 00:49:16,070
has one boat. But my question going forward is,

771
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,164
is there a possibility or opportunity to increase the number of boats

772
00:49:21,232 --> 00:49:24,488
or water rescue equipment and apparatuses that

773
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:26,570
are in my section of the city?

774
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,128
Mr. Weller, thank you, first of all, for your question and for being here

775
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,584
in person. I know that's important.

776
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:38,504
All this is important to you. So I wrote down your questions.

777
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:43,272
I will thank albennett is one of our better

778
00:49:43,326 --> 00:49:46,944
employees, and he's very responsive and he's very committed to what he's doing.

779
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:51,056
So I'll certainly relay your thanks to him in

780
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:54,530
regards to the engines and disrepair. Five years ago,

781
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,372
five and a half years ago when I came here,

782
00:49:58,506 --> 00:50:01,520
we had an issue with an aging fleet.

783
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,380
There was no question about that. We had engines that were

784
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:08,964
essentially catching fire on scene. That was

785
00:50:09,002 --> 00:50:12,848
as a result of the

786
00:50:12,874 --> 00:50:15,716
way they were purchasing these units. They're very expensive.

787
00:50:15,828 --> 00:50:19,380
A fire truck cost us about $600,000 per unit.

788
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,616
A ladder truck is over a million dollars. It's very expensive.

789
00:50:22,808 --> 00:50:26,636
They made a large purchase. They had made a large purchase about

790
00:50:26,738 --> 00:50:31,916
15 years before that, and they

791
00:50:31,938 --> 00:50:35,900
didn't have a comprehensive replacement plan, which meant that

792
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,872
you buy a large purchase of fleet vehicles at one point, and they're great

793
00:50:40,006 --> 00:50:43,468
when they're new, but then they all start aging at the same time and falling

794
00:50:43,484 --> 00:50:47,076
apart at the same time. I'm happy to report that thanks

795
00:50:47,098 --> 00:50:50,432
to the mayor and council and their support, we've replaced

796
00:50:50,496 --> 00:50:54,164
over 50% of the entire fleet in these last five

797
00:50:54,202 --> 00:50:57,984
years. We have a small percentage

798
00:50:58,032 --> 00:51:02,356
that now is outside the ten year expected

799
00:51:02,468 --> 00:51:05,080
lifecycle of these heavy apparatus.

800
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,776
We have begun to focus not only on the

801
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:12,676
heavy apparatus and ambulances, but we were also focusing

802
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:16,344
on the light duty vehicles, as we mentioned through some other creative

803
00:51:16,392 --> 00:51:20,108
programs, the lease of these vehicles and outright purchase of

804
00:51:20,114 --> 00:51:23,464
these. So we're making a wholesale replacement

805
00:51:23,512 --> 00:51:27,136
of all apparatus. They're all emergency response apparatus in

806
00:51:27,158 --> 00:51:31,056
my estimation. But in regards to the engines and

807
00:51:31,158 --> 00:51:34,412
the ladder trucks, we have made significant improvements

808
00:51:34,476 --> 00:51:37,872
in the state of this fleet. In addition to that,

809
00:51:37,926 --> 00:51:41,668
the ambulance replacements, we've replaced almost 50% of those

810
00:51:41,754 --> 00:51:45,108
ambulances as well. We are no longer

811
00:51:45,194 --> 00:51:49,056
doing the refurbishing and putting them back into

812
00:51:49,178 --> 00:51:52,244
the system. We're buying turnkey

813
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:56,388
ambulances, which with all the new safety

814
00:51:56,484 --> 00:52:00,036
features that come with the new apparatus. So that's

815
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:03,668
a better and safer unit for our firefighters.

816
00:52:03,764 --> 00:52:07,236
So in regards to that, yes, we are

817
00:52:07,278 --> 00:52:10,744
well over 50% of replacement of our entire fleet

818
00:52:10,872 --> 00:52:14,444
in terms of technology. We have made significant investments in that too.

819
00:52:14,482 --> 00:52:18,476
We've replaced all our MDTs and the majority of our apparatus.

820
00:52:18,588 --> 00:52:21,776
We've also switched over our records management system for

821
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:25,168
our inspectors. Now we're in the in four program. In the

822
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:28,596
past, they were doing their inspections and documenting on

823
00:52:28,618 --> 00:52:32,640
paper. That's very antiquated, very inefficient. We've made significant

824
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,576
improvements in technology in that respect. Every one of our apparatus,

825
00:52:36,608 --> 00:52:40,276
our heavy apparatus, has a thermal imaging camera. Now, in the

826
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:44,088
past, that was not the case. So we've provided that in

827
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:47,144
terms of technology. And so I can point

828
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:51,210
to a variety of areas where we've made improvements in technology training.

829
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,656
Again, sometimes we can't

830
00:52:55,688 --> 00:52:59,644
get the contributions from the general fund because

831
00:52:59,682 --> 00:53:03,324
of different priorities, but we haven't stopped there. We've looked

832
00:53:03,362 --> 00:53:07,024
for nontraditional funding sources to provide for training and

833
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:10,828
equipment and health and safety aspects for our firefighters.

834
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:14,236
In the last five and a half years, we've drawn down almost $11

835
00:53:14,268 --> 00:53:17,860
million of grant funds that are dedicated for

836
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:21,236
either training or equipment or improvements for health and

837
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:24,484
safety of our firefighters. So we're making progress in that.

838
00:53:24,682 --> 00:53:26,420
In regards to applicants,

839
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,024
especially for applicants from within the city limits, I completely agree

840
00:53:32,062 --> 00:53:35,032
with you. Matter of fact,

841
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:39,608
in this last month, I've met with the

842
00:53:39,694 --> 00:53:44,060
superintendent for HISD, the vice superintendent for HISD,

843
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,392
and we're looking at a program to be able to recruit individuals

844
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:51,980
right out of high school. The requirement for

845
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,576
24 credit hours of college hasn't

846
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:59,408
changed. But what we do know is that there are a lot of students,

847
00:53:59,494 --> 00:54:03,824
and according to their numbers, there are about 6000 students every year that graduate with

848
00:54:03,942 --> 00:54:08,372
an equivalent of 24 credit hours that come from

849
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:11,604
AP classes or come from other

850
00:54:11,722 --> 00:54:15,396
early college courses that right now

851
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,532
we hadn't been capturing. My goal is to be able to

852
00:54:18,586 --> 00:54:22,356
go directly into these communities that are underrepresented

853
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:26,184
in our department and recruit directly from high

854
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:28,040
school onto this organization.

855
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,872
When they graduate, they have choices. Some of them go to college,

856
00:54:33,006 --> 00:54:36,396
some of them go to the military, some go to work. I want to be

857
00:54:36,418 --> 00:54:40,732
another choice for those where we can provide a career for

858
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:44,460
these individuals and they have the opportunity to serve in their communities.

859
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,224
So we are looking at that, and I agree with you. Our department should be

860
00:54:48,262 --> 00:54:52,050
representative of the communities that we serve. That has been a

861
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:56,304
focus of mine. If you see our demographics, we've made

862
00:54:56,342 --> 00:54:59,780
huge improvements in recruitment of more minorities

863
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,550
into the fire department. And there

864
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,912
we did some things. We made some changes that just increased the number of qualified

865
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:12,688
applicants. The standards haven't changed. Okay. But if

866
00:55:12,714 --> 00:55:16,616
we can have a bigger pool of applicants, then we can be more selective as

867
00:55:16,638 --> 00:55:20,436
far as who can come in. We're not having any trouble filling

868
00:55:20,468 --> 00:55:23,816
the classes that we have for the academy.

869
00:55:23,928 --> 00:55:27,148
We have had some challenges, especially during the Pandemic, where we

870
00:55:27,154 --> 00:55:30,808
had to do remote learning in classes via virtually,

871
00:55:30,984 --> 00:55:34,068
because getting a certification for an EMT

872
00:55:34,104 --> 00:55:37,376
is not the virtual approach is not conducive to

873
00:55:37,398 --> 00:55:40,636
that. The curriculum is very challenging.

874
00:55:40,828 --> 00:55:45,004
They need the in class tuition,

875
00:55:45,052 --> 00:55:49,036
so our attrition rate there has been higher than normal. We're hoping that has

876
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:52,240
changed. Council has approved us getting additional

877
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,020
resources and buildings at the train academy to be able to provide

878
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,924
that training. So we're hoping that that changes for

879
00:55:59,962 --> 00:56:03,620
the better in regard to hurricane season and the assets.

880
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,624
When I got here in 2017, we had Harvey. We didn't have any

881
00:56:07,662 --> 00:56:11,204
high water vehicles. Matter of fact, we had one, and that was from District

882
00:56:11,252 --> 00:56:14,860
A, and we got that vehicle the day that Harvey made

883
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:18,332
landfall. Since then, we've made

884
00:56:18,386 --> 00:56:22,392
tremendous progress. Now we have 15 high water vehicles

885
00:56:22,456 --> 00:56:26,492
that are spread out throughout the city. We've replaced

886
00:56:26,556 --> 00:56:29,904
our boats. Those are all serviceable. We have an

887
00:56:29,942 --> 00:56:33,296
80 member water strike team that is now trained and equipped and

888
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:36,556
ready to deploy and augment for these

889
00:56:36,598 --> 00:56:40,256
resources for these incidents. And we've

890
00:56:40,288 --> 00:56:43,504
also made partnerships.

891
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:47,044
We've used our network with other departments to be able

892
00:56:47,082 --> 00:56:50,456
to meet the training requirements and to be

893
00:56:50,478 --> 00:56:54,856
able to scale up if required. One example

894
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:57,770
is we've partnered with Public Works.

895
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,668
Do you know how many people fit in the back of a dump truck?

896
00:57:01,844 --> 00:57:05,356
38. Yes, I do. Yes,

897
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:08,924
sir. And the reason we know that is because we've used those in the past,

898
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:12,620
but now we've incorporated them into the Cat system.

899
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:16,764
So if we expect a hurricane

900
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:20,336
or some inclement weather, we will deploy resources from

901
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:24,156
Public Works in other areas into our fire stations, and they'll

902
00:57:24,188 --> 00:57:27,972
have a firefighter assigned to them to be able to manage

903
00:57:28,026 --> 00:57:31,796
and be an additional asset in addition to what

904
00:57:31,818 --> 00:57:35,348
we have. So we have made tremendous strides in

905
00:57:35,354 --> 00:57:38,470
that respect as well. In these short five years.

906
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,728
The resources are spread out throughout the city.

907
00:57:42,894 --> 00:57:48,200
Okay. And that is a tactical decision,

908
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,132
but they're deployable anywhere in the city. Okay.

909
00:57:52,286 --> 00:57:53,630
Shift. Absolutely.

910
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,390
One is that we can't put all the resources in one area because

911
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,580
there may not be enough room. But we do know, and based on

912
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,184
what we anticipate, as far as if there's a certain area that we're more

913
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:10,656
concerned about, then we will shift resources and pre deploy them

914
00:58:10,678 --> 00:58:14,128
to a little bit closer. But those resources are

915
00:58:14,294 --> 00:58:17,808
city of Houston resources, the fire department's resources. It doesn't mean that

916
00:58:17,814 --> 00:58:21,456
they belong to a certain district. We keep them in certain areas,

917
00:58:21,488 --> 00:58:24,164
but we can deploy them and shift as needed.

918
00:58:24,362 --> 00:58:28,176
So my only concern at this point is hopefully the council sees

919
00:58:28,288 --> 00:58:31,636
the benefit of scaling you up compared to the county

920
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:35,192
scaling up the sheriff's department so that you can actually stand

921
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:38,568
in the breach if and when and really not if,

922
00:58:38,654 --> 00:58:41,916
when the next natural disaster hits our city that

923
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:44,956
has to deal with water rescue. Right. Well,

924
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:48,524
look, again, we welcome

925
00:58:48,642 --> 00:58:50,940
those additional resources,

926
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,912
but we are certainly also reaching out to

927
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:58,576
other response agencies to have a

928
00:58:58,598 --> 00:59:02,316
unified front and in response to our community's

929
00:59:02,348 --> 00:59:05,612
needs. We work very well with the Houston Police Department.

930
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:08,688
We work very well with the Harris County Sheriff's Department.

931
00:59:08,784 --> 00:59:12,820
We work very well with Public Works and all other city departments.

932
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,080
We have a good network of personnel

933
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,144
that train together. We're familiar

934
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:25,704
with each other's capabilities and the resources that we can come to bring

935
00:59:25,742 --> 00:59:29,464
to bear in case we need it, because I think that's a more efficient way

936
00:59:29,502 --> 00:59:32,892
of meeting the expected risk of this community

937
00:59:33,026 --> 00:59:36,892
strategic partnership. Absolutely. And the key is to have those

938
00:59:36,946 --> 00:59:40,140
partnerships in place before the disaster happens.

939
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:43,836
Thank you very much. If we have

940
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:47,940
any additional questions, you can always share those at District E, at Houst,

941
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,632
gov. Ms. McHenry, did you have

942
00:59:51,686 --> 00:59:55,104
anything additional that you would like to speak on that we have

943
00:59:55,142 --> 00:59:58,336
not covered? Okay. Well, chief, I want to thank you and

944
00:59:58,358 --> 01:00:02,036
your entire department for the tremendous presentation and the tremendous job you all

945
01:00:02,058 --> 01:00:05,636
do on a daily basis to keep Houstonian safe. As a

946
01:00:05,658 --> 01:00:09,476
council, we are very much appreciative of all that

947
01:00:09,498 --> 01:00:12,424
you do and all of the contributions that you make. So to you and your

948
01:00:12,462 --> 01:00:16,180
entire team, thank you very much. Thank you. Council Member

949
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,604
there are no additional in person speakers before we adjourn.

950
01:00:19,652 --> 01:00:23,732
Please note, budget workshops will continue next week, starting Monday,

951
01:00:23,796 --> 01:00:27,368
May 16 through Thursday, May 19.

952
01:00:27,454 --> 01:00:30,916
Reminder to council members to be checking SharePoint for uploaded

953
01:00:30,948 --> 01:00:34,256
presentations as well as responses for any questions and

954
01:00:34,278 --> 01:00:37,904
submitted. Thank you again to everyone for being here, and this

955
01:00:37,942 --> 01:00:39,440
meeting is adjourned.
