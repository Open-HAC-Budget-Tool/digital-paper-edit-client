Happy Public Works Week. All right,

02:39.250 --> 02:42.000
thank you very much. Good morning, everybody.

02:42.370 --> 02:45.774
Today we're here to discuss the fiscal year 2023 budget

02:45.822 --> 02:49.554
for Houston Public Works. My name is Carol Haddock, director of Houston Public

02:49.592 --> 02:53.426
Works. And I'm joined by my colleague, Samir Solanki, chief financial officer for

02:53.448 --> 02:57.086
Houston Public Works. We have other members of the Houston

02:57.118 --> 03:00.866
Public Works executive team and also our budget team that have joined

03:00.898 --> 03:03.958
us in this meeting so that we may answer questions on the spot if you

03:03.964 --> 03:07.174
may have them. Next slide, please. Oh, wait,

03:07.212 --> 03:10.710
you're already at the next slide. Houston Public Works

03:10.780 --> 03:14.186
aims to abide by our purpose and our five to thrive values in all that

03:14.208 --> 03:18.026
we do. Together, we create a strong foundation for Houston to

03:18.048 --> 03:21.286
thrive, and we do this every day by doing the things that most people

03:21.328 --> 03:25.534
don't see or notice unless something goes wrong. And we

03:25.572 --> 03:29.166
take great pride in that. We embody our five to thrive values every

03:29.188 --> 03:32.710
day. We operate through integrity, through teamwork.

03:32.890 --> 03:36.974
We take ownership of things we're responsible for. We strive

03:37.022 --> 03:40.398
to communicate and we look for respect,

03:40.494 --> 03:44.558
starting with ourselves, our colleagues, the citizens we serve,

03:44.654 --> 03:48.306
this body and ultimately the city of Houston itself. Next slide,

03:48.338 --> 03:52.546
please. Houston Public Works Executive

03:52.578 --> 03:56.162
Teams consists of the capable people that you see on this slide.

03:56.306 --> 03:59.670
At the end of this presentation, there is a very extensive appendix.

04:00.170 --> 04:03.722
It shows all of our accomplishments for fiscal year 2022,

04:03.776 --> 04:07.066
even though it's not over yet. And while I would love to talk

04:07.088 --> 04:10.506
about our accomplishments, I am going to skip that today and leave that for

04:10.528 --> 04:14.014
you to look at at the back of the presentation. So please

04:14.132 --> 04:16.960
do take the time to look through that as you go through it.

04:17.490 --> 04:20.798
Next slides, please, for what you see on a

04:20.804 --> 04:24.542
day to day basis. Our operational service lines, our five

04:24.596 --> 04:27.650
service lines that provide the services. Our capital projects,

04:28.070 --> 04:32.002
customer account services, houston Permitting Center, houston Water

04:32.056 --> 04:35.998
and Transportation and Drainage operations. These service lines don't

04:36.014 --> 04:39.714
have a single cost fund center. They actually have multiple

04:39.762 --> 04:42.790
funds, and most of them have multiple cost centers.

04:43.610 --> 04:47.254
We have a long presentation and I am going to hand this over to

04:47.292 --> 04:50.618
Samir Solanki to discuss the budget for Houston Public Works at this time.

04:50.704 --> 04:53.820
Samir? Thank you, Carol. Next slide, please.

04:55.950 --> 04:58.534
Like Carol mentioned, this is a pretty significant presentation.

04:58.582 --> 05:01.226
We'll do our best to try to get through all the information in the time

05:01.248 --> 05:04.910
that's allotted. Like Carol had mentioned,

05:04.980 --> 05:08.686
public Works consists of several funds and this slide summarizes the changes in

05:08.708 --> 05:12.366
revenues and expenditures from fiscal year 2022 for each

05:12.388 --> 05:15.738
of these funds. I'm not going to call out each of these numbers as we'll

05:15.754 --> 05:19.394
cover all of this in detail in the upcoming slides. Please keep in mind

05:19.432 --> 05:22.702
that the variances are from the FY 22 current budget.

05:22.846 --> 05:26.226
And because this is rolled slide, these numbers are in millions.

05:26.338 --> 05:30.066
Once we get to each of the fund, we'll be talking in thousands. Next slide,

05:30.098 --> 05:33.734
please. First, we'll begin by

05:33.772 --> 05:36.854
discussing the General Fund. Okay,

05:36.972 --> 05:41.350
there we go. Now, this is just an overview of the major services requirements,

05:41.430 --> 05:44.646
impact and population served by the General Fund within the Houston

05:44.678 --> 05:48.134
Public Works Department. Let's dig a little deeper. The requirements

05:48.182 --> 05:51.406
for this service delivery. Let me skip that part. Let's go to the

05:51.428 --> 05:52.270
next slide.

05:56.290 --> 05:59.626
There we go. These are the revenue overviews.

05:59.738 --> 06:03.770
For the revenue portion, a small amount is brought in from recoveries and refunds,

06:03.850 --> 06:06.542
and majority of this is from sale of capital assets.

06:06.686 --> 06:10.194
Recoveries and refunds are from the recovery of electricity costs for

06:10.232 --> 06:12.900
decorative lighting that's above the city standard.

06:13.350 --> 06:17.026
Something like closer between poles or higher wattage bulbs,

06:17.138 --> 06:21.330
which the city has paid to CenterPoint and bills back to the corresponding management districts

06:21.410 --> 06:23.830
who request the above standard lighting.

06:24.810 --> 06:26.120
Next slide, please.

06:28.330 --> 06:31.626
The majority of services for this portion of the General Fund is

06:31.648 --> 06:35.558
related to electricity for traffic signals and street lights citywide,

06:35.654 --> 06:39.030
which is considered a restricted account with no budgeted FTEs.

06:39.190 --> 06:43.438
The Real Estate Management section generates revenue for the General Fund

06:43.524 --> 06:46.926
by selling property and easements throughout the Houston area, and this

06:46.948 --> 06:50.778
is accomplished by nine positions within this fund. This section

06:50.794 --> 06:55.022
is also responsible for management of Houston Public Works real estate inventory,

06:55.086 --> 06:58.946
including oversight and management of city owned property interest such

06:58.968 --> 07:02.498
as streets, easements, alleys and fee owned land and the process

07:02.584 --> 07:06.194
requests for encroachment into streets or alleys through the Joint Referral

07:06.242 --> 07:08.360
Committee process, the JRC process.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.240
Next slide, please.

07:13.770 --> 07:17.366
Now we'll take a look at the expenditures and this is a further breakdown of

07:17.388 --> 07:21.142
these expenditures for the General Fund. The General Fund's largest expense

07:21.206 --> 07:24.806
consists of the restricted accounts that I'd mentioned previously, which include

07:24.838 --> 07:28.406
service chargebacks for fuels, electricity, It accounts

07:28.438 --> 07:31.646
and other items. The projected budget for electricity in

07:31.668 --> 07:35.386
this fund is 21.4 million due to transitioning

07:35.418 --> 07:39.120
from a floating rate to a locked in electricity rate.

07:40.370 --> 07:41.600
Next slide, please.

07:44.930 --> 07:48.282
Now, this chart is broken out by personnel

07:48.346 --> 07:51.986
and nonpersonal items, and you'll notice that the largest amount is

07:52.008 --> 07:55.554
made up of restricted accounts, that is primarily electricity,

07:55.602 --> 07:59.186
which is at 21.4 million, and the It hits restricted

07:59.218 --> 08:00.840
accounts for about 300,000.

08:03.690 --> 08:05.000
Next slide, please.

08:07.450 --> 08:10.746
The Net Change slide walks through the items that contribute to

08:10.768 --> 08:14.586
the increase in expenditures for the Houston Public Works portion of

08:14.608 --> 08:18.074
the General Fund. The operating budget decreased slightly in

08:18.112 --> 08:21.918
supplies based on spending trends as compared to fiscal year 22.

08:22.084 --> 08:26.202
There were increases in contractual or mandated adjustments for restricted accounts

08:26.266 --> 08:29.310
and interference services of about 700,000,

08:29.460 --> 08:33.098
as well as 17,000 increase in hope and benefit rates,

08:33.194 --> 08:36.706
which resulted in an overall increase of 3.3% in

08:36.728 --> 08:40.286
the fiscal year 2023 budget. Next slide,

08:40.318 --> 08:43.778
please. Now let's move on to

08:43.784 --> 08:45.640
the project cost recovery fund.

08:48.330 --> 08:52.326
This slide provides an overview of the major services, requirements, impacts and

08:52.348 --> 08:55.558
populations served by the Project Cost Recovery Fund.

08:55.724 --> 08:59.674
This is a revolving fund and it derives its revenues from different funds within

08:59.712 --> 09:03.258
Houston Public Works, which means that whatever revenues are brought in

09:03.344 --> 09:04.970
must be fully expended.

09:09.230 --> 09:12.886
Next slide. Got it. The Project Cost Recovery Fund

09:12.928 --> 09:17.374
revenues are increasing from 51.9 million to 55.7

09:17.412 --> 09:20.638
million, for about a difference of 3.8 million.

09:20.804 --> 09:24.610
The project cost recovery fund expenses are increasing. Excuse me.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.210
2.8 million of this is due to increase in hope and benefits,

09:28.360 --> 09:32.178
and the remaining increases are in restricted accounts, interfund services

09:32.264 --> 09:35.826
and building maintenance. Next slide,

09:35.858 --> 09:36.440
please.

09:41.450 --> 09:45.042
And this is a program organizational chart which I'll go through individually.

09:45.106 --> 09:48.694
The transportation and drainage Operations manages and analyzes

09:48.742 --> 09:52.566
traffic calming patterns, collects data coordinates with regional partners

09:52.598 --> 09:55.654
to develop transportation and drainage projects.

09:55.782 --> 09:59.746
The office of the Director administers the city's MWD

09:59.878 --> 10:03.934
program. Then we have Houston Water, which manages contractual issues

10:04.052 --> 10:07.982
and other required coordination related to the Northeast water

10:08.116 --> 10:11.866
purification plant expansion. Then we have Financial Management

10:11.898 --> 10:15.662

10:15.806 --> 10:19.310
provides financial reports on project and grant related activities,

10:19.470 --> 10:23.358
monitors and accounts for CIP related revenues and expenses.

10:23.534 --> 10:27.314
Then we have Capital Projects, which is responsible for the implementation

10:27.362 --> 10:31.330
of engineering and construction of infrastructure projects for the City's

10:31.410 --> 10:34.626
adopted five year CIP plan. Then there's

10:34.658 --> 10:38.058
also Information Technology, which provides and maintains technology

10:38.144 --> 10:40.822
solutions to support planning, design, construction,

10:40.966 --> 10:44.518
operation and maintenance of the public infrastructure systems,

10:44.614 --> 10:48.266
and also technically assists the Houston Public Work inspectors to

10:48.288 --> 10:51.974
perform work and input data into Cipms from remote

10:52.022 --> 10:55.882
sites. Then the managed support. Finally, the Managed and Support Branch provides

10:55.946 --> 10:59.966
necessary funding to ensure effective delivery of accurate, reliable and

10:59.988 --> 11:04.020
timely biweekly payroll reports. Next slide please.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.630
And this chart shows a breakdown between the personnel

11:09.710 --> 11:13.762
and non personnel. The total budget proposed is 55.7

11:13.816 --> 11:17.960
million. Of that, the personal accounts for 45 million.

11:19.370 --> 11:20.600
Next slide please.

11:23.450 --> 11:27.174
Now we move on to the building inspection fund, which is also

11:27.212 --> 11:28.780
the Houston Permitting Center.

11:31.630 --> 11:35.062
The major services is to ensure buildings and structures

11:35.126 --> 11:39.014
adhere to City of Houston's Building Code, as well as review and approve

11:39.062 --> 11:43.274
commercial and residential development plans for the City's infrastructure.

11:43.402 --> 11:47.166
The impact is safety, usability and sustainability of

11:47.188 --> 11:50.506
the private and publicly built environment. Next slide,

11:50.538 --> 11:54.110
please. The Building

11:54.180 --> 11:57.890
Inspection Fund of revenues are increasing from 84.4 million

11:58.040 --> 12:01.698
up to 91.0 million for a 6.7 million

12:01.784 --> 12:06.126
increase due to more anticipated permitting and construction activity

12:06.238 --> 12:09.106
and annual CPI increase in fees.

12:09.298 --> 12:13.734
The expenditures are decreasing from 103,000,000 to 102.5

12:13.772 --> 12:17.350
million, mainly due to reduction in the fiscal 23

12:17.500 --> 12:20.534
for the design and development of the new permitting and inspection

12:20.582 --> 12:24.054
system and decreasing in land and building costs for joint parking

12:24.102 --> 12:27.526
garage with HPD. And this is offset by the increase

12:27.558 --> 12:30.090
in personal costs and restricted budgets.

12:31.730 --> 12:33.040
Next slide please.

12:37.010 --> 12:40.666
And this is the program organizational chart for the Building Inspection

12:40.698 --> 12:44.734
Fund and for the Office of the Director. We have the Mayor's Office for

12:44.772 --> 12:48.146

12:52.302 --> 12:56.378
between the Mayor, City Council, city Departments and other public and private entities.

12:56.574 --> 13:00.386
Then the Houston Permitting Center, which performs a regulatory role to ensure the safety,

13:00.418 --> 13:03.702
usability and sustainability of private and public

13:03.756 --> 13:07.778
built environment. Then also the practical application of reviews,

13:07.874 --> 13:12.018
permanent permit administration and field inspection for building codes,

13:12.114 --> 13:15.466
sign administration and public infrastructure. Then we have

13:15.488 --> 13:19.210
Information Technology that provides the highest quality technology based

13:19.280 --> 13:22.442
services in the most effective and cost effective manner.

13:22.586 --> 13:26.106
Then we have the Management Support Branch, which provides necessary funding

13:26.138 --> 13:29.534
for the Building Inspection biweekly payroll function.

13:29.732 --> 13:31.040
Next slide, please.

13:34.050 --> 13:37.826
The total proposed budget is 102.5 million. Of that,

13:37.928 --> 13:41.646
personnel accounts for around 70.8 million. The nonpersonal

13:41.678 --> 13:45.442

13:49.922 --> 13:53.846
support and 4.3 is for HPC, It and supplies and

13:53.868 --> 13:57.746
services. Restricted accounts consist mainly of hits restricted accounts,

13:57.778 --> 14:01.478
which is 2.7 million. Houston Public Works indirect costs

14:01.494 --> 14:05.194
of 2.3 million, citywide indirect costs of 1.6

14:05.232 --> 14:09.366
million. Fleet restricted accounts, which is 1 million and payroll restricted

14:09.398 --> 14:13.434
accounts of about 1 million. Then the building code enforcement of

14:13.472 --> 14:17.546
3.1 million is broken down into 1.5 million of consulting

14:17.578 --> 14:21.086
services to assist the city in residential and commercial brand review

14:21.188 --> 14:25.106
and inspection in citywide developments, with the remaining 2.3

14:25.128 --> 14:27.780

14:46.590 --> 14:50.910
All right. Transportation and Drainage, which contains funds 23

14:50.980 --> 14:54.894
223, 1020, 311 and 20 312.

14:55.092 --> 14:59.226
Funds 23 1020 311 and 20 312 comprise

14:59.338 --> 15:02.734
of the Build Houston Forward Program. These funds were

15:02.772 --> 15:06.354
previously all held in 23 ten and were split into

15:06.392 --> 15:09.700
three funds in fiscal year 2021.

15:11.350 --> 15:14.566
Pause for just a moment. The presentation appears to have disappeared from the

15:14.588 --> 15:15.350
screens.

15:20.890 --> 15:24.886
We have an It issue, as you recognize, so please follow along on

15:28.624 --> 15:32.394
thanks. 24. Okay, we're on slide number

15:32.432 --> 15:36.246
24. The major services provided

15:36.278 --> 15:39.606
are to maintain and operate street and drainage systems,

15:39.718 --> 15:43.118
to plan for reinvestment of infrastructure and growth needs for the

15:43.124 --> 15:46.926
City of Houston, and to coordinate with outside entities for impacts to

15:46.948 --> 15:50.474
city infrastructure and uses. The impacts affect neighborhood

15:50.522 --> 15:53.966
drainage, subregional or drainage, and detention and citywide

15:53.998 --> 15:56.770
mobility. Next slide.

15:59.190 --> 16:03.342
This is the overview of the revenues for the transportation and drainage operations.

16:03.486 --> 16:07.518
The Stormwater Fund, which is 23 two revenues are decreasing by

16:07.544 --> 16:11.142
3.3 million, and this is due to about 5.8 million

16:11.196 --> 16:14.630
less transfer needed from the combined utility system to cover

16:14.700 --> 16:18.426
operations and maintenance. And this is offset by an increase in transfer from

16:18.448 --> 16:22.220
the drainage charge from Fund 23 ten by 2 million.

16:22.590 --> 16:25.818
Fund 23 ten. Revenues are increasing by

16:25.904 --> 16:29.514
400,000 due to higher projected amount of interest earned

16:29.562 --> 16:31.440
compared to fiscal year 22.

16:33.490 --> 16:36.794
The Advalorum Tax Fund 20 311 revenues

16:36.842 --> 16:40.414
are increasing by 2.1 million, mainly due to 1.7

16:40.452 --> 16:43.838
million additional tax revenues projected to transfer

16:43.924 --> 16:47.954
in from the General Fund, as well as 400,000 higher projected amount

16:47.992 --> 16:51.362
of interest earned compared to fiscal year 2022.

16:51.496 --> 16:54.914
The Metro Etol Fund 20 312 is mostly flat,

16:55.042 --> 16:59.186
increasing mainly due to 550,000 increase

16:59.218 --> 17:02.914
in Interfront revenues for potential work performed by transportation

17:02.962 --> 17:07.686
and drainage operations for other Houston Public Service Lines or other city departments,

17:07.798 --> 17:11.206
as well as 315,000 for expected reimbursements

17:11.318 --> 17:13.900
under the Metro General Mobility Program.

17:14.590 --> 17:15.900
Next slide, please.

17:20.030 --> 17:23.726
And this is the transportation and drainage expenditures. On the

17:23.748 --> 17:27.422
expenditure side, the Stormwater Fund is decreasing by 1.5 million

17:27.476 --> 17:31.982
due to lower operating costs, which is about 2,000,002.6 million,

17:32.116 --> 17:35.646
restricted budgets of about 300,000 and capital rollovers

17:35.678 --> 17:39.374
of 600,000. This is offset by an increase in personnel

17:39.422 --> 17:43.006
costs of about 2 million. The Ddsrf

17:43.038 --> 17:46.258
Funds group are increasing by 6.2 million due

17:46.274 --> 17:50.162
to a 6.9 million increase in transfers to CIP,

17:50.306 --> 17:54.070
which is offset by a 500,000 decrease in supplies.

17:55.370 --> 17:59.114
Keeping in mind that 22 to 23 1020 311 20

17:59.152 --> 18:02.934
312 make up the Ddsr Funds group. Next slide.

18:03.062 --> 18:04.700

13 surrounding counties. Next slide please. Slide 34.

23:09.730 --> 23:13.486
On the revenue side, the decrease is due to the

23:13.508 --> 23:17.114
reducing grant contributions from Metro. Metro reduced

23:17.162 --> 23:20.778
contributions by 527,000 due

23:20.794 --> 23:24.046
to Metro's takeover of the maintenance and upkeep of TranStar

23:24.078 --> 23:27.298
Center from GSD. The increase in contribution from the

23:27.304 --> 23:30.050
city of Houston and Harris County is about 76,000.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.806
On the expenditure side, personnel and land and ground

23:33.838 --> 23:36.946
maintenance services are the main drivers for the increase.

23:37.058 --> 23:40.498
Then also the increase is also due to hope, pension,

23:40.674 --> 23:44.150
health insurance and land and other ground maintenance costs.

23:44.570 --> 23:47.738
Next slide please. Slide number 34 five.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.360
system. Next slide please.

24:03.890 --> 24:07.754
The proposed budget is 3.4 million of which nonpersonal

24:07.802 --> 24:11.054
accounts for 2 million. The breakout is the

24:11.092 --> 24:14.554
operations and maintenance accounts for 1.7 million which consists

24:14.602 --> 24:18.274

24:32.658 --> 24:35.906
which includes electricity, hits and then fleet,

24:35.938 --> 24:39.340
payroll and utilities accounts. Next slide please.

24:41.470 --> 24:44.826
Finally, we move on to

24:44.848 --> 24:48.634
the biggest enterprise fund which is the combined utility system, the largest fund

24:48.672 --> 24:52.590
group within Houston Public Works. The major

24:52.660 --> 24:57.594
services for the utility are production and distribution of over 146,000,000,000

24:57.642 --> 25:01.658
gallons of water, treatment of 90 billion gallons of wastewater and

25:01.684 --> 25:04.962
billing and collection for 480,000 water

25:05.016 --> 25:08.500
and wastewater accounts. Next slide please.

25:10.950 --> 25:14.642
The revenue highlights include in fund 8300.

25:14.776 --> 25:19.314
They're increasing mainly due to 280,000,000 water and sewer rate increase

25:19.442 --> 25:23.350
adopted by council via ordinance 2021

25:23.500 --> 25:26.886
five one five fund 83 one. There is a

25:26.908 --> 25:31.274
5.7 million decrease in scheduled debt service payments then

25:31.312 --> 25:34.886
fund 83 five is the combined utility system savings

25:34.918 --> 25:38.486
account and doesn't typically generate revenue. However, in fiscal

25:38.518 --> 25:42.586
year 2021 we had a $9.4 million

25:42.618 --> 25:45.966
increase due to water authorities contribution for

25:45.988 --> 25:49.326
the lease value payment which is about 9.4 or

25:49.348 --> 25:52.980
9.5 million. Next slide please.

25:56.070 --> 26:00.002
The expenditure highlights include the following for fund 8300,

26:00.136 --> 26:04.034
there is an increase of 43.3 million increase in operations and

26:04.072 --> 26:07.362
maintenance costs. And this is broken down into various

26:07.426 --> 26:11.634
categories which include about 9.5 million in chemicals and gas,

26:11.762 --> 26:14.486
3.3 million management consulting services,

26:14.668 --> 26:18.602

26:22.320 --> 26:26.358
work services, 4.8 million in river authority contracts,

26:26.534 --> 26:28.902
1.2 million in computer software,

26:29.046 --> 26:33.018
2.8 million increases in the consent decrease stipulated penalties

26:33.194 --> 26:37.070
4.2 million increase in building maintenance services, 2.1 million

26:37.140 --> 26:41.150
increase in intrafund electricity maintenance, 1 million

26:41.220 --> 26:44.322
Interfront application services, 1.8 million

26:44.376 --> 26:47.566
in system debt service transfer, and 1 million in non

26:47.598 --> 26:50.770
capital office expenditures. There's also a 19 million

26:50.840 --> 26:54.482
increase in personnel due to hope and benefits rate changes

26:54.616 --> 26:57.750
and a 2.3 decrease in debt service transfers.

26:58.970 --> 27:02.454
For 83, one, there is a 5.8 million in

27:02.492 --> 27:06.600
system debt services payment. Then for Fund 83 five,

27:06.970 --> 27:10.378
we have an increase in the pay go, which is the pay as you

27:10.384 --> 27:14.394
go service, the cash funding for the CIP portion. Then 11.7

27:14.432 --> 27:18.038
million increase in capital equipment including new and rollovers,

27:18.134 --> 27:21.366
4.7 million increase for meter replacement program

27:21.488 --> 27:25.354
and 1.5 million increase for McKinney building maintenance and improvements

27:25.482 --> 27:29.306
and 800,000 increase for Water Authority contract debt

27:29.418 --> 27:33.054
and then a 4.8 million reduction in transfer to

27:33.092 --> 27:36.734
Stormwater. Now, a quick note that we are purposely

27:36.782 --> 27:40.398
making the decision to increase our cash funding or the pay go funding

27:40.414 --> 27:44.294
for the combined utility system CIP so we can cash on projects instead

27:44.332 --> 27:48.086
of debt financing given the current market environment that has high

27:48.108 --> 27:52.274
inflation and also with the rising interest rates. Next slide,

28:34.946 --> 28:39.474
management support Branch provides support in the areas of records management,

28:39.602 --> 28:43.110
fleet support and internal review. Now we have Customer

28:50.518 --> 28:54.218
payments, manages credit and collections processes and responds to

28:54.224 --> 28:57.260
billing inquiries. Next slide, please.

28:58.510 --> 29:02.302
The combined utility system total proposed budget is 1.6

29:02.356 --> 29:05.662
billion for fiscal year 2023, of which

29:05.716 --> 29:09.674
personnel accounts for 234,000,000 and non personnel budget

29:09.722 --> 29:14.118
is one point rounded up to 1.4 billion. The nonpersonal

29:14.154 --> 29:17.922
section consists of the following $583,000,000

29:17.976 --> 29:21.742
is for debt service 285,000,000 water and wastewater

29:21.806 --> 29:25.314
operations, 51 million transfer to Stormwater

29:25.442 --> 29:29.286
and 300 million for the pay as you go for the cash funding for

29:29.308 --> 29:32.306
the CIP. Next slide,

29:32.338 --> 29:32.920
please.

29:38.250 --> 29:41.622
Then this is the combined utility system revenues,

29:41.686 --> 29:44.774
expenditures, and this sort of gives you a net overview.

29:44.822 --> 29:48.918
And if you please note that in fiscal year 22 and fiscal year 23,

29:49.024 --> 29:52.474
the combined utility system is showing a budgetary deficit,

29:52.602 --> 29:56.558
which the combined utility system is intentionally spending down its

29:56.644 --> 30:00.266
fund balance. Next slide,

30:00.298 --> 30:04.026
please. That concludes the Houston

30:04.058 --> 30:07.346
Public Works Budget presentation. We're open to any questions. Thank you

30:07.368 --> 30:10.306
very much. We have a number of council members in queue. And first of all,

30:10.408 --> 30:14.002
thank you for skinnying this down. When I saw 20

30:14.056 --> 30:17.150
public speakers, I knew we had to do a little bit of an audible.

30:17.230 --> 30:20.910
So thank you, directors. Appreciate that. Council Member Michael Kubosh.

30:20.990 --> 30:24.478
Thank you very much. I noticed on page 40 you talked about that's

30:24.494 --> 30:28.262
the first time I heard the word consent decree. Have we had any breaches

30:28.326 --> 30:30.890
of the consent decree?

30:32.910 --> 30:35.290
Would you mind repeating the question? The wastewater.

30:36.030 --> 30:39.514
Have we had any breaches since we've actually signed the consent

30:39.562 --> 30:42.926
decree? So we have continued to have some

30:42.948 --> 30:46.698
sanitary sewer overflows that. Part of signing

30:46.714 --> 30:51.166
the consent decree is an agreed plan

30:51.348 --> 30:54.974
to invest and reduce those over time. There's a recognition

30:55.022 --> 30:58.242
when you sign the consent decree that it's not going to magically stop.

30:58.376 --> 31:01.906
So we have continued to have some, but we are doing better.

31:02.008 --> 31:05.598
We are seeing significant reductions with the increased

31:05.694 --> 31:09.426
cleaning and televising that is already happening. Let me ask you concerning

31:09.458 --> 31:13.554
the defect. I get reports of defective water meters.

31:13.682 --> 31:17.194
One of the biggest complaints I get is the fact that we have

31:17.392 --> 31:20.934
water bills, that citizens are trying to contest

31:20.982 --> 31:25.594
their water bills. Have we determined what

31:25.632 --> 31:29.386
percentage of the water meters are defective and

31:29.408 --> 31:32.926
what the citizens do? So let me

31:32.948 --> 31:36.650
jump in real quick. It is very rare for an actual water meter

31:36.730 --> 31:39.854
to be defective. What we are

31:39.892 --> 31:43.658
seeing is the remote reader that attaches to the water meter.

31:43.754 --> 31:47.554
They are 20 years old and they are dying every day.

31:47.592 --> 31:51.086
And so what happens is, we have months where we estimate,

31:51.118 --> 31:54.338
because we didn't get a good read, but the meters themselves,

31:54.424 --> 31:57.606
it's very rare for one to be defective. Ways to test them.

31:57.708 --> 32:01.334
Well, if the device that's attached to it, that's reading it is

32:01.372 --> 32:05.334
defective, are getting old, then the citizen would consider that

32:05.372 --> 32:08.618
a defective water meter because they see it as

32:08.704 --> 32:10.860
all encapsulated. As one thing.

32:11.790 --> 32:13.610
How do we buy fuel,

32:14.030 --> 32:18.054
gasoline, gasoline, and diesel

32:18.102 --> 32:22.142
and CNG? Do we purchase it in an

32:22.196 --> 32:25.806
annual basis, or do we have contracts? How do we

32:25.828 --> 32:29.374
get our fuel? So I'm going to defer that to fleet, as that

32:29.412 --> 32:32.638
is not public works purchasing separately. It is a

32:32.644 --> 32:36.222
citywide contract. Thank you very much. Put me back in the queue,

32:36.366 --> 32:39.570
sir. Council Member Vice Chair Ed Pollard.

32:40.550 --> 32:43.570
Thank you, Chair, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for the presentation.

32:44.410 --> 32:47.974
My questions are regarding permitting from

32:48.012 --> 32:51.414
a financial standpoint. What are some processes or

32:51.452 --> 32:54.486
systems that we can put in place or that we have put

32:54.508 --> 32:58.298
in place to streamline expedite, speed up

32:58.384 --> 32:59.980
the permitting process.

33:01.230 --> 33:04.602
So we recently gave a presentation to TTI about

33:04.656 --> 33:08.198
some of the improvements and processes that are happening internally.

33:08.374 --> 33:11.438
Some of the biggest things that we've done is

33:11.604 --> 33:15.406
provide an opportunity for the same reviewer to review the plan set on

33:15.428 --> 33:18.960
a subsequent submittal. But we've also

33:19.410 --> 33:22.926
augmented our capacity by executing

33:23.038 --> 33:27.102
outside contracts that allow us, when our capacity exceeds our personnel

33:27.166 --> 33:30.210
resources, to use some of those outside resources.

33:30.870 --> 33:34.626
We're still working to catch up and get on top

33:34.648 --> 33:38.306
of it. We admit that we are longer than we need to be, but we

33:38.328 --> 33:41.446
do believe that we have the tools in place to eat down the backlog and

33:41.468 --> 33:44.678
keep up moving forward. So when you say that, you know that we're kind

33:44.684 --> 33:48.220
of behind, but we're doing what we can to catch up,

33:49.230 --> 33:52.854
are there benchmarks in place or a strategy

33:52.902 --> 33:56.602
in place to show that, okay, we know we need to get here,

33:56.736 --> 34:00.778
here's how we're going to do it. So yes, sir. And that's

34:00.794 --> 34:03.966
part of what was presented at TTI just recently. I would

34:03.988 --> 34:07.550
be happy it is available on the website. I'm council member.

34:09.090 --> 34:12.258
We'll provide that information, but we'll be happy to provide you some

34:12.264 --> 34:15.714
additional information on that. Okay? And can we jump to page 25

34:15.752 --> 34:16.660
really quick,

34:21.590 --> 34:24.946
Director? It might be good to get a date of that meeting if your staff

34:24.978 --> 34:27.910
is able to help us with that for the Council member.

34:29.690 --> 34:31.320
Everybody doesn't watch those.

34:33.610 --> 34:37.082
Yes, sir. Page 25. Page 20.

34:37.216 --> 34:40.666
Go ahead. Page 25. If we can pull it

34:40.688 --> 34:45.322
up on the screen. There was a for

34:45.376 --> 34:49.646
stormwater. We're showing a 4.8%

34:49.748 --> 34:53.066
decrease change from variance

34:53.098 --> 34:56.586
from fiscal year 22 to now. Can you further elaborate

34:56.618 --> 34:57.360
on that?

35:01.810 --> 35:05.362
Trying to find where you're looking at the 4.8 million. I'm seeing a 5.8 million

35:05.416 --> 35:08.978
less transfer. I see the stormwater revenues, is that

35:08.984 --> 35:12.766
what you're talking about? Not the top line. Right. So the, the revenues are decreasing

35:12.798 --> 35:16.840
by 3.3 million. This is due to $5.8 million less

35:17.290 --> 35:21.074
transfer needed from the combined utility system to cover operations

35:21.122 --> 35:25.314
and maintenance cost. That's what it's due to. And it's offset

35:25.362 --> 35:29.042
by an increase in transfer from 23 ten. So stormwater

35:29.106 --> 35:32.618
gets its funding from two areas. One is Ddsr of 23 ten,

35:32.704 --> 35:35.786
and the bulk of the funding comes from the combined utility system.

35:35.888 --> 35:38.906
And so this year there was a lesser need and then a little bit of

35:38.928 --> 35:42.894
an increase funding from the Ddsrf funds group. So it nets out

35:42.932 --> 35:46.526
to about a 3.3 million decrease in the funding that was needed for

35:46.548 --> 35:49.550
Saltwater. But there is adequate funding for it, in your opinion?

35:50.690 --> 35:53.380
Yes, adequate funding. Absolutely. Thank you.

35:55.270 --> 35:58.626
Before we go to council member Sally Alcorn, we've been

35:58.648 --> 36:02.046
joined by council members Amy Peck, Tarsha Jackson,

36:02.158 --> 36:06.114
Mary Anne Huffman, vice Mayor Pro TEM Martha Castex Tatum

36:06.162 --> 36:09.750
and Chairman David Robinson. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

36:10.250 --> 36:13.170
Thank you, Chair, and thank you for your presentation.

36:13.330 --> 36:17.554
In the Ddsrf drainage fee revenue, I noticed

36:17.602 --> 36:22.522
that we budgeted last year like $113,000,000

36:22.576 --> 36:26.394
in revenue. We ended up getting more than that, about 126 or 28

36:26.432 --> 36:29.934
million, and then we're budgeting back down at 113. Is there a reason

36:29.972 --> 36:33.806
that we had that increase last year and over what we thought? And why

36:33.828 --> 36:35.440
aren't we expecting it? Again,

36:41.330 --> 36:46.106
some of these revenues, it depends on projections,

36:46.298 --> 36:50.286
and again, we look at it from a fund perspective. So you're budgeting more conservatively

36:50.318 --> 36:53.246
on revenues. That's what we try to do. Just we don't want to overestimate.

36:53.278 --> 36:55.822
Okay, thank you. And in the Ddsrf,

36:55.886 --> 36:59.462
advalorum transferred from the general

36:59.516 --> 37:03.270
fund was about 77 million, plan about 77 million.

37:03.420 --> 37:07.042
We're advancing about 97 million to capital

37:07.106 --> 37:10.114
projects. I'm assuming some of that's coming from from fund balance.

37:10.162 --> 37:14.122
From from fund balance, yes. When we get the transfer from

37:14.176 --> 37:18.234
the general fund to that fund, that is less what's paid

37:18.272 --> 37:21.630
down in debt service. That's done before you get the transfer? That's correct. That is

37:21.700 --> 37:24.766
debt service prior to do you know how much debt has been

37:24.788 --> 37:28.506
paid down from Advalorum since Rebuild

37:28.538 --> 37:32.466
Houston started? The amount of debt that we paid off so far has been

37:32.488 --> 37:35.220
about and let me have that information here.

37:37.750 --> 37:44.290
Let me bring that's

37:45.830 --> 37:49.222
1.5 billion that's been paid, and we have about 905,000,000.

37:49.276 --> 37:52.966
That's $1.5 billion in debt. And that is a

37:52.988 --> 37:56.374
major thing because that's what let us borrow for

37:56.412 --> 37:59.930
pension obligation bonds. I mean, that the reduction in debt was

38:00.000 --> 38:03.830
a big part in letting us borrow more money. So that's an important feature

38:03.910 --> 38:07.322
on the building Inspection fund. And that presentation was done in

38:07.456 --> 38:10.730
November 4 of last year on permitting.

38:11.090 --> 38:14.174
So we're due for an update, and Council Member Robinson and I will be

38:14.212 --> 38:17.566
hosting an event on permitting. And put

38:17.588 --> 38:20.826
me back in the queue. Council Member Michael Kubash.

38:21.018 --> 38:22.420
Thank you very much.

38:24.950 --> 38:28.878
Once again, the number of complaints that I receive

38:29.054 --> 38:32.820
each week deal with either water problems,

38:33.190 --> 38:36.946
either leaks, or the customer feels

38:36.978 --> 38:40.630
overbuilt, and the other is permitting.

38:41.610 --> 38:45.640
Permitting. The citizens just

38:46.430 --> 38:49.546
shouldn't have to hire an expediter to get a

38:49.568 --> 38:52.826
permit done. And I

38:52.848 --> 38:56.874
don't know what your role is on trying to get

38:57.072 --> 39:01.226
this permitting done properly, but I know that we passed,

39:01.418 --> 39:04.894
during the Parker administration, right before she left,

39:05.092 --> 39:08.714
we passed an ordinance that allowed the permit fees

39:08.762 --> 39:12.320
to go into a separate fund. Is that still happening?

39:12.770 --> 39:16.002
So the permitting fund

39:16.056 --> 39:19.666
that we briefed today is a special revenue fund within the

39:19.688 --> 39:23.554
general fund that was created during that time. So it is a subset of

39:23.592 --> 39:27.726
the general fund, but it is somewhat firewalled

39:27.758 --> 39:31.186
off in the sense that the fees generated by permit fees

39:31.298 --> 39:34.326
stay in that fund and are used for the expenses in that fund.

39:34.428 --> 39:38.566
Well, the whole purpose for permitting is for public safety and not for necessarily revenue

39:38.598 --> 39:43.274
gathering. But I do want to say

39:43.312 --> 39:46.922
that we definitely need some help there. How much

39:46.976 --> 39:50.734
money did the Public Works apply for

39:50.772 --> 39:54.990
ARPA funds or cares dollars from the federal government on COVID-19?

39:57.250 --> 40:00.634
Separate that is, separate from this budget hearing,

40:00.682 --> 40:04.050
and we're happy to provide that to you separately and offline.

40:04.470 --> 40:08.286
We worked with the citywide processes for both ARPA and COVID

40:08.398 --> 40:12.158
and within the city's priorities. We did receive funding

40:12.254 --> 40:15.314
in both of those categories to support activities within the department,

40:15.362 --> 40:19.474
but that is not included in this presentation

40:19.522 --> 40:23.206
as we were directed. Well, I would sure like to have that sent to me.

40:23.228 --> 40:26.134
Would you do that? Yes.

40:26.252 --> 40:30.326
No, absolutely, yes. I mean, the City of Houston received

40:30.358 --> 40:34.010
ARPA funds and it was subdivided into each and every

40:34.080 --> 40:37.420
department within the city. I'm not sure what your allocation is that correct?

40:38.670 --> 40:41.120
Yes, that is correct. Thank you,

40:43.250 --> 40:46.286
Council Member Tiffany Thomas. Thank you,

40:46.308 --> 40:49.342
Mayor Pro. Tim, you went through the presentation fairly quickly,

40:49.396 --> 40:52.706
so can you clarify some points to me and just give me context for the

40:52.728 --> 40:55.810
divisions that have a substantial budget but zero

40:55.880 --> 40:59.186
FTE? So, for example, if we go

40:59.208 --> 41:03.010
to page 27 stormwater Fund,

41:03.160 --> 41:07.814
the Management Support Branch, it's 296,000,000,

41:07.932 --> 41:14.280
but there's zero FTE. Can you just clarify why

41:16.090 --> 41:19.446
it's a chargeback? Yes, I believe that's a citywide

41:19.478 --> 41:22.060
chargeback that comes back to us that we pay.

41:23.710 --> 41:26.998
And is that the same train of thought for all divisions

41:27.014 --> 41:30.766
that might have substantial budget, certain C TOI processes that we pay

41:30.788 --> 41:33.680
for that get charged back to us? Got it. Thank you much.

41:34.610 --> 41:38.206
Follow up by Council Member Michael Kubosh. Can you

41:38.228 --> 41:41.498
tell us where the city of Houston rates

41:41.514 --> 41:44.766
in major cities as far as our water cost that we're

41:44.798 --> 41:48.734
charging our citizens? Have you done a comparison with other cities

41:48.782 --> 41:52.382
like Dallas or Fort Worth or the major Texas cities?

41:52.526 --> 41:56.162
Yes, sir. Last year when we went through the rate study and

41:56.216 --> 42:00.022
recommended updates to City Council, we had several charts that were direct

42:00.076 --> 42:03.186
comparisons with other cities. We were at the bottom of the pile, and now we're

42:03.218 --> 42:07.046
still towards the bottom of the pile. I'm glad to hear that. Thank you

42:07.068 --> 42:09.654
very much for that. I think the citizens need to be aware of that because

42:09.692 --> 42:12.858
when they get their water bills, I'm sure they don't feel that way. And the

42:12.864 --> 42:15.450
bottom of the pile being good, as in we're cheaper.

42:16.590 --> 42:20.042
Thank you very much. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

42:20.186 --> 42:23.886
Thank you. Back on the building Inspection fund. And I know that

42:23.908 --> 42:28.046
there are 26 additional FDES coming to

42:28.068 --> 42:31.134
the permitting center over last year.

42:31.332 --> 42:34.734
And that's good because in looking

42:34.772 --> 42:38.354
at the performance measures, we're at 22% of

42:38.392 --> 42:42.306
first reviews for commercial plans in 15 days, but our goal is

42:42.328 --> 42:45.654
to get to 80%. So that's a pretty significant thing. I know we've done some

42:45.692 --> 42:49.126
outsourcing. I know we've got some we have not done any

42:49.148 --> 42:51.794
outsourcing. Not outsourcing. Sorry. Staff augmentation.

42:51.922 --> 42:57.318
Very clear about that. Staff augmentation and

42:57.404 --> 43:00.634
then hiring. And I'll ask

43:00.672 --> 43:04.522
these in writing. I'd like to know specifically. I've got some charts there

43:04.576 --> 43:08.474
where the Vacancies and make sure we're getting those 26 people to

43:08.512 --> 43:11.838
the right places. Primarily, the complaints I

43:11.844 --> 43:15.102
hear about on slow downs are in the office of City

43:15.156 --> 43:18.794
Engineer, so traffic and Storm and to some degree,

43:18.842 --> 43:22.462
planning. So that's where I'd want to see those

43:22.516 --> 43:25.806
resources spent. But I'll have some additional questions in

43:25.828 --> 43:29.426
writing, but just wanted to get that out there that I was happy to see

43:29.448 --> 43:33.074
that there were 26. I think that we have had attrition of over

43:33.112 --> 43:36.722
30 people. So 26 hopefully brings us back to address

43:36.776 --> 43:40.546
the backlog and go to the future. Thank you. Yes. And make sure we upload

43:40.578 --> 43:43.734
those to SharePoint, as you always. So thank you. Just a quick

43:43.772 --> 43:47.570
follow up to Council Member Kubasha's. Questions related to permitting.

43:47.730 --> 43:50.986
A few months ago, we did a supplement to hire we

43:51.008 --> 43:53.930
hired a firm to supplement the existing employees.

43:54.350 --> 43:57.846
Does that $89 million I'm looking on the expense side include

43:57.878 --> 44:01.418
that, or is that separate? So it is

44:01.584 --> 44:04.538
in the non personnel side of the expenses.

44:04.634 --> 44:08.042
So it's not included in the 89 million I was looking at in the previous

44:08.106 --> 44:11.794
page. Correct. I think I answered my own question.

44:11.832 --> 44:15.406
It's not included. It's a supplement. You also mentioned consent

44:15.438 --> 44:18.914
decree, stipulated penalties. How much do we pay in

44:18.952 --> 44:22.786
stipulated penalties on consent decree? So the

44:22.808 --> 44:26.010
first demand that we had, and I'd be recalling this from memory,

44:26.110 --> 44:29.560
was for 1.2 million. 1.3 million.

44:30.010 --> 44:32.360
And that was for a full year's worth.

44:33.530 --> 44:36.966
We had budgeted about two and a half million when we originally laid this out.

44:36.988 --> 44:40.474
And we're performing better and have lower estimates than that.

44:40.512 --> 44:43.706
So less than 2 million a year. And it will continue to go

44:43.728 --> 44:47.034
down, although the way that the agreement is

44:47.072 --> 44:50.250
written, the stipulated penalties are a lot lower.

44:50.320 --> 44:53.886
Now. When you get to year five and year eight and year ten,

44:53.988 --> 44:57.760
they go up because that's the incentive for you to get the work done.

44:58.130 --> 45:01.950
Got it. So we better get moving. Yes. So on

45:02.100 --> 45:05.710
page slide 40, you had on

45:05.780 --> 45:09.342
C US, 256,000,000 billion

45:09.406 --> 45:12.786
dollar million dollar increase on the variance to

45:12.808 --> 45:16.498
the budget you mentioned. It's pay as you go. Water Authority

45:16.594 --> 45:20.674
contract Debt Is that the Northeast

45:20.722 --> 45:24.706
water purification percentage debt in our percentage

45:24.738 --> 45:25.560
of payment,

45:27.310 --> 45:31.014
83 five. What is the increase?

45:31.062 --> 45:34.746
You said pay go water is a

45:34.768 --> 45:38.554
significant portion of it. Previously, we'd done about $70

45:38.592 --> 45:42.282
million in Pego, but given the current environment, with the market

45:42.336 --> 45:46.718
conditions, we increased that to 300 million. So it's an additional about 230,000,000.

45:46.804 --> 45:50.590
That's a significant portion. But I think what you're talking about is 800,000,

45:50.660 --> 45:54.462
which is a very small amount. That's increase for Water Authority

45:54.526 --> 45:57.010
contractual debt that previously existed.

45:57.910 --> 46:01.518
What bucket do we pay the Northeast water? Our share of the Northeast

46:01.534 --> 46:05.586
water purification plant. It's part of the total debt services that I had mentioned previously

46:05.618 --> 46:09.346
and included in the $583,000,000 on an annual basis.

46:09.458 --> 46:11.350
Council member Tasha Jackson.

46:14.810 --> 46:18.502
Thank you. Thank you, Director Haddock, for the presentation.

46:18.646 --> 46:22.106
I have one question about the transportation and

46:22.128 --> 46:25.706
drainage operation budget. Does that in any of that

46:25.728 --> 46:29.918
include like a drainage maintenance plan

46:30.084 --> 46:33.150
for neighborhoods that have the open ditches?

46:33.490 --> 46:37.166
Yes, the operation side of that does include the maintenance of the

46:37.188 --> 46:40.922
roadside ditches as part of the activities

46:40.986 --> 46:44.122
within that fund. Okay. Because right now, I know the residents are

46:44.196 --> 46:47.374
like the ditches that's within their neighborhoods. They are required

46:47.422 --> 46:50.578
to maintenance their own drainages and

46:50.584 --> 46:54.290
their ditches. And so one of the things we're trying to push is to get

46:54.360 --> 46:58.242
Public Works to conduct that maintenance because that

46:58.296 --> 47:01.846
contributes a lot of the flooding in these neighborhoods. And so I just

47:01.868 --> 47:05.126
wanted to know, was that included? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Thank you,

47:05.308 --> 47:07.660
staff from Council member Abby Cayman's office.

47:09.710 --> 47:13.418
Good morning, everyone. Council Member Cayman first wants to thank

47:13.504 --> 47:17.546
Public Works and the entire team and the Director, of course, for your

47:17.568 --> 47:20.986
leadership and all the work that you guys are doing day in and

47:21.008 --> 47:24.894
day out. There are too many people to think individually right now,

47:25.012 --> 47:28.202
but we recognize not only the budgetary challenges,

47:28.266 --> 47:31.950
but the additional challenge that COVID presented. I know you didn't

47:32.850 --> 47:36.142
go through them, but the list is in the appendix

47:36.286 --> 47:40.270
should be commended. We have a few questions that we will also share and submit

47:40.350 --> 47:43.940
through the SharePoint. But she noticed some

47:44.490 --> 47:48.342
divisions in Red, and that

47:48.396 --> 47:52.198
Council Member came in, has passed on a budget amendment last year

47:52.284 --> 47:55.970
that will possibly help inspections and bring in additional revenue.

47:56.130 --> 47:59.706
Flagging that to see where in the process that is.

47:59.808 --> 48:03.430
Again, we will communicate that question via SharePoint.

48:03.590 --> 48:07.386
The question that Council Member Cayman is asking of each department is due to

48:07.408 --> 48:11.434
the budgetary constraints, including the revenue cap, what needs exist

48:11.482 --> 48:14.670
that we are not able to address through this year's budget?

48:16.450 --> 48:19.966
That's a big question. So within the activities that we have

48:19.988 --> 48:23.402
defined for us, we believe that we have adequate funding to address

48:23.476 --> 48:26.898
if we want to add activities citywide, that's where we begin to

48:26.904 --> 48:30.414
run into challenges. I know there's some requests for additional maintenance

48:30.462 --> 48:32.900
in some areas that we see,

48:33.270 --> 48:37.426
particularly in the storm drainage system. We also see it in our sidewalks.

48:37.618 --> 48:41.030
And so our challenges would be those. But I would

48:41.100 --> 48:44.786
also remind everybody that in street and drainage, in our transportation

48:44.818 --> 48:49.082
and drainage operations, we are limited to 25%

48:49.136 --> 48:52.698
that can be spent on O and M by Ddsrf, by the

48:52.704 --> 48:53.850
charter amendment.

48:57.390 --> 49:00.786
And we are at that 25% with the activities

49:00.838 --> 49:03.982
we have. So additional funding wouldn't necessarily even be available

49:04.116 --> 49:07.790
for those activities. Council member Tiffany Thomas.

49:08.210 --> 49:11.726
Thank you. Just to follow up on that, can you share more about the

49:11.748 --> 49:15.198
capital improvement projects that have been scheduled but not funded?

49:15.374 --> 49:18.930
Because I know we have significant number of capital improvements that

49:19.000 --> 49:22.846
are due to neighborhoods. So in context of having adequate funding,

49:22.878 --> 49:27.094
but also the caveat of that 25%. Could you elaborate on that?

49:27.212 --> 49:30.902
Well, so the capital improvements are not with that 25%

49:30.956 --> 49:34.310
cap. And so the funding that we have available,

49:34.460 --> 49:37.834
we've seen a significant increase in the estimated cost

49:37.872 --> 49:40.954
of those projects. And so everybody's still in

49:40.992 --> 49:44.954
line. It takes longer to serve the line. And so because

49:44.992 --> 49:48.678
of the increased cost, in some cases, the decreased funding

49:48.854 --> 49:52.474
we have seen because of revenue cap less transfer than

49:52.512 --> 49:55.934
we had originally projected on the advilorum side, and that's really

49:55.972 --> 49:59.550
what has extended out. We've also seen a decrease in metro

50:00.290 --> 50:03.634
sales tax revenue that has been transferred as well.

50:03.832 --> 50:07.986
So it is really a struggle. But we

50:08.008 --> 50:11.294
have those projects developed enough to seek the federal funding

50:11.422 --> 50:14.626
that should become available through the infrastructure bill and the

50:14.648 --> 50:18.514
IJA. So we are actively matching

50:18.562 --> 50:21.942
projects to programs as we see the buckets become

50:21.996 --> 50:25.442
available to move those forward, with a big emphasis

50:25.506 --> 50:29.146
on looking for funding those capital projects in our

50:29.168 --> 50:32.570
communities that have historically been underinvested.

50:33.070 --> 50:36.426
And there's no way to skip the line. I'm just asking, can we skip the

50:36.448 --> 50:37.580
line? No.

50:41.190 --> 50:44.542
Last question from council members is Council Member David Robinson.

50:44.606 --> 50:48.086
Thank you, Chair and Director. Thanks for your presentation. I know you've covered a lot

50:48.108 --> 50:51.346
of territory and picking up a little bit where my colleague Tiffany

50:51.378 --> 50:55.178
Thomas just went with Deferred CIP projects and

50:55.264 --> 50:59.350
some of what our chair has inquired about with the biggest ticket items

50:59.430 --> 51:02.966
on water and sewer and the general purpose combined

51:02.998 --> 51:07.546
utility programs. I wanted to get some territory

51:07.658 --> 51:12.174
on the real bottom of that. I know you and I have talked about the

51:12.212 --> 51:15.994
expenditures going to the accessibility program that Director

51:16.042 --> 51:20.180
Casares has taken on, as well as some of what you've described today with

51:20.630 --> 51:24.530
TranStar and other programs. So from the large

51:24.600 --> 51:28.066
budget items to the small, I wonder if you could just take a second to

51:28.088 --> 51:31.202
narrate some of your concerns about the changes

51:31.256 --> 51:35.558
in the budget this year, what we might be looking at, and anything

51:35.644 --> 51:39.170
that we can help you with. I don't know that I would use concerns.

51:39.250 --> 51:42.646
I would say that we definitely have some opportunities to look

51:42.668 --> 51:46.418
back at our activities and make sure that everything that we're

51:46.434 --> 51:49.786
putting our energy effort resources to is the highest priority for the

51:49.808 --> 51:52.954
city. And so as we look at our biggest ones,

51:52.992 --> 51:56.334
our water and wastewater, obviously we're going to be focused on the

51:56.372 --> 52:00.074
resilience and sustainability of the existing systems

52:00.202 --> 52:03.790
while also allowing for that future growth and redevelopment.

52:04.130 --> 52:07.674
And if you bring that through water wastewater, that also includes

52:07.722 --> 52:10.978
street and storm. But on the permitting side, this will

52:10.984 --> 52:15.042
be the year that we really focus on moving towards the

52:15.096 --> 52:19.538
2021 building codes. And so we're going to be really focused on

52:19.704 --> 52:23.334
that forward leaning. What can we do to make sure that we are setting things

52:23.372 --> 52:27.014
in place that administrations after this

52:27.052 --> 52:29.634
one where I'm sitting,

52:29.762 --> 52:32.406
are primed for the future?

52:32.588 --> 52:35.558
Yes, and as you and I have spoken about with that on the queue of

52:35.564 --> 52:39.638
things that we're going to take on, whether that's within a special called meeting

52:39.734 --> 52:43.066
in the June meeting of the TTI committee or as soon as

52:43.088 --> 52:46.766
we can get to it after July 1,

52:46.948 --> 52:50.746
we're going to take that on pending the administration's approval.

52:50.778 --> 52:53.630
So thank you very much, Director. Thank you, Chair.

52:55.090 --> 52:58.794
We'll now move to the public comment section. There are six virtual

52:58.842 --> 53:03.300
public speakers and we have a total of 20

53:03.750 --> 53:07.010
public speakers on the list. Please, when I announce your name,

53:07.080 --> 53:10.542
please hit star six to unmute because we will have to go rapidly.

53:10.606 --> 53:14.334
Our first speaker is Mr. Doug Smith. 1 minute.

53:14.462 --> 53:16.530
Each speaker has 1 minute.

53:23.870 --> 53:25.050
Doug Smith.

53:35.570 --> 53:38.750
Mr. Tom Thompson. Star Six. Mr.

53:38.820 --> 53:39.710
Thompson?

53:42.930 --> 53:45.950
Yes. Can you hear me? Is this Mr.

53:46.100 --> 53:49.300
Thompson? That's Doug. Yes, go ahead.

53:51.110 --> 53:55.410
Who do we have? Do we have Tom Thompson?

53:56.550 --> 53:58.340
And this is Doug Smith as well.

53:59.590 --> 54:01.590
Do we have Mr. Thompson?

54:02.970 --> 54:05.880
Yes, go ahead. Do you hear me? Yes, sir, we can.

54:07.370 --> 54:08.680
Okay, thank you.

54:12.010 --> 54:14.380
Do you want Doug to go first? Yes, please.

54:22.830 --> 54:24.810
Mr. Thompson, we're waiting.

54:26.530 --> 54:30.286
My comments very brief. I just want to say I

54:30.308 --> 54:33.930
am encouraged to see the increase in funding proposed

54:34.010 --> 54:37.830
for street maintenance in the transportation and drainage operations

54:37.930 --> 54:41.314
budget, but strong alert to the city

54:41.352 --> 54:44.958
to allocate sufficient funding to ensure that our bike lanes

54:44.974 --> 54:48.594
are regularly cleaned and maintained, ensuring that this

54:48.632 --> 54:52.114
critical transportation in

54:52.152 --> 54:55.762
which the city and its partners have already made and committed a significant

54:55.826 --> 54:59.938
investment, can continue to be used, thereby increasing

55:00.034 --> 55:03.686
safety and accessibility for all transportation modes.

55:03.798 --> 55:06.762
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Thompson. Go ahead, Mr.

55:06.816 --> 55:10.394
Smith. Good morning. I have

55:10.432 --> 55:14.090
two quick comments. First of all, congratulations to the Department.

55:14.430 --> 55:18.286
If you look at page 958 of the report,

55:18.468 --> 55:22.202
their performance statistics with the Metro funds is fantastic.

55:22.266 --> 55:25.898
It's the best of any department that I've seen, and they deserve

55:25.914 --> 55:29.906
credit for that. And I'd like to ask one question. We provide

55:30.008 --> 55:34.110
water to entities outside the city. This is a valuable commodity

55:34.190 --> 55:37.582
and getting more valuable every day. Can we charge premium

55:37.646 --> 55:41.158
rates to those users to recognize that value

55:41.244 --> 55:44.470
and give Houston citizens a break in their bills?

55:45.050 --> 55:48.294
Unfortunately, I've asked that question many times, and the answer to that

55:48.332 --> 55:51.560
is no, we cannot. Why?

55:52.170 --> 55:53.740
We're required by state.

55:55.470 --> 55:57.500
Okay, that answers it. Thank you.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.540
Next speaker is Mr. That's all,

56:03.550 --> 56:06.010
Joseph. Katufro.

56:07.550 --> 56:11.086
Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Yes, sir. Thank you. Sorry for butchering your

56:11.108 --> 56:14.942
name. It's all right. Happens every day.

56:14.996 --> 56:18.506
Good morning. My name is Joe Kutrufo, and I'm the Executive Director of Bike Houston,

56:18.538 --> 56:22.740
a nonprofit organization working to transform Houston into a city where

56:23.270 --> 56:26.206
anyone can get around safely and easily by bike.

56:26.318 --> 56:29.886
Like Mr. Thompson, I'm here to express support for the Houston

56:29.918 --> 56:33.246
Bikeways Maintenance program. Houston's bike network

56:33.278 --> 56:36.866
is critical transportation infrastructure and it's time to start maintaining

56:36.898 --> 56:40.374
it as such. And it's no secret to anyone, including some people in this

56:40.412 --> 56:45.986
room who ride bikes around our city that are protected by leaves,

56:46.018 --> 56:49.450
litter, broken glass. I even came across the aftermath of

56:49.600 --> 56:52.886
car crash and found the whole front end of a Honda in the bike lane

56:52.918 --> 56:56.746
one time. This is the number one complaint that Bike Houston hears about from people

56:56.768 --> 57:00.590
who ride bikes and in fact, some folks in this room. Council members

57:00.660 --> 57:04.526
Alcorn Robinson, we saw the debris piling up in the WA and

57:04.548 --> 57:08.350
Commonwealth bike lanes. Council member Pollard, you may remember the garbage we saw

57:08.420 --> 57:12.046
in the new bike lanes on Hillcroft. Council member Cesneros knows all too

57:12.068 --> 57:15.758
well about the debris in the bike lanes on Hardy Street. And Council member Kubosh

57:15.774 --> 57:18.974
could spend a lot less on repairs at Blue Line Bike Lab if our bikeways

57:19.022 --> 57:22.606
were better maintained. And nobody likes a flat tire, of course. But when we fail

57:22.638 --> 57:26.726
to clear debris out of our bikeways, we create a safety hazard too. Because when

57:26.748 --> 57:30.146
the lanes are full of debris, people opt to ride outside of the bike lanes,

57:30.178 --> 57:33.894
entirely defeating the purpose of the bike lanes. We've invested so much

57:33.932 --> 57:37.186
in building Houston's amazing bike network. And we're going to celebrate

57:37.218 --> 57:40.874
these investments on Friday at the City's Bike to Work Day. But we can't stop

57:40.912 --> 57:44.394
at just building the lanes. We have to do the fiscally responsible thing and

57:44.432 --> 57:48.198
maintain them too. Our bike network. Mr. Katrufo,

57:48.214 --> 57:50.974
I'll let you go longer than a minute. Can you wrap it up in 5

57:51.012 --> 57:54.426
seconds? I do. Friday. We have to make sure it's

57:54.458 --> 57:57.982
useful and safe. And if we're serious about being a multimodal city where people

57:58.036 --> 58:01.838
have real transportation options other than driving, we need to make sure the bike

58:01.854 --> 58:04.674
lanes are useful and safe. Thank you. Thank you very much.

58:04.712 --> 58:08.018
Mr. Kurtrufo. Just to make sure we don't have

58:08.104 --> 58:12.470
Jason Oliver, Aris Brown or Vicky Martin on virtually.

58:14.970 --> 58:18.642
And you are? Okay. Jason,

58:18.706 --> 58:22.626
come on. We'll go through the list. Next we

58:22.668 --> 58:26.394
have Saba Blanding no,

58:26.512 --> 58:28.010
we'll call you in a minute.

58:29.710 --> 58:33.066
Yes, sir. 1 minute. Just a reminder. Got it? Yes, sir.

58:33.168 --> 58:35.840
Hi. I'm Jason Oliver. I live in District G.

58:37.250 --> 58:41.114
Few questions I'm interested in. Oh perfect. That's helpful.

58:41.162 --> 58:42.000
Thank you.

58:46.210 --> 58:48.400
So I was tall too, so this works. Well,

58:49.570 --> 58:52.994
I see that you all completed 74 council district service from

58:53.032 --> 58:57.022
projects, which is great. People often mention how long it takes to implement

58:57.086 --> 59:00.786
CDSF projects. I'm interested in what can we do to

59:00.808 --> 59:04.674
speed up the implementation. Kind of going along with what Council member

59:04.722 --> 59:08.278
Thomas said. And I'm also interested on page 29, if you

59:08.284 --> 59:11.814
can explain how much is being transferred through

59:11.852 --> 59:15.974
these 380 agreements specifically and then to which entities

59:16.102 --> 59:19.654
are receiving those which entities are receiving those funds.

59:19.782 --> 59:20.700
Thank you.

59:26.290 --> 59:27.520
Hold on 1 second.

59:29.810 --> 59:36.654
Any comments to

59:36.692 --> 59:40.290
answer the previous question for a 380 agreement is about 4.1 million.

59:40.360 --> 59:42.500
4.1. Yes. Okay, thank you.

59:45.750 --> 59:49.700
Debt service. Correct. Got it.

59:52.410 --> 59:55.320
You are Saba Blanding? Yes. Okay.

59:56.570 --> 1:00:00.646
Hi, I'm saba Blanding District I i had two questions

1:00:00.828 --> 1:00:04.626
over the past seven years. I noticed that your department has seen fluctuations

1:00:04.658 --> 1:00:08.650
in your budget for year to year, increasing as much as 9.8%

1:00:08.800 --> 1:00:11.994
and decreasing as much as 19%. How have

1:00:12.032 --> 1:00:15.642
these annual fluctuations impacted your department's ability to

1:00:15.696 --> 1:00:19.006
plan for and provide adequate services to meet the needs of the

1:00:19.028 --> 1:00:22.906
city of Houston? I thought it was really interesting how much it fluctuated.

1:00:23.098 --> 1:00:27.006
And secondly, on slide 14, you said that more infrastructure is

1:00:27.028 --> 1:00:30.766
degrading due to deferred, maintenance and insufficient

1:00:30.878 --> 1:00:34.146
reinvestment. What type of investment do you need to

1:00:34.168 --> 1:00:37.346
see from the city of Houston in order for your department to

1:00:37.368 --> 1:00:40.450
address Houston's infrastructure needs in a timely manner?

1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:48.092
So fluctuation in budget and then the second

1:00:48.146 --> 1:00:52.028
part yeah, it just goes back to so some of

1:00:52.034 --> 1:00:55.432
this fluctuation in budget over previous years has actually been rollover

1:00:55.496 --> 1:00:58.816
of capital equipment. Our vehicles are replacing our

1:00:58.838 --> 1:01:02.416
dump trucks. Very large expenditures that transfer from year to year in the

1:01:02.438 --> 1:01:06.240
operations budget. On the capital investment side, what we're seeing

1:01:06.310 --> 1:01:10.008
is actually the result of decades of underinvestment

1:01:10.124 --> 1:01:13.236
that we can't maintain to keep it in useful life when

1:01:13.258 --> 1:01:17.044
something's 50, 60, 70 years old. And so that statement is really

1:01:17.082 --> 1:01:20.480
referring to the fact that we have increased build. Use of

1:01:20.490 --> 1:01:23.636
forward is increasing the reinvestment and reconstruction.

1:01:23.748 --> 1:01:26.936
But there are things that are because every year we go

1:01:26.958 --> 1:01:30.520
along, things are continuing to age that continue to get

1:01:30.670 --> 1:01:34.236
beyond that. The water and wastewater system, the water rate study that we did last

1:01:34.258 --> 1:01:38.350
year will have a significant reinvestment in the water and wastewater system

1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:40.620
as a result of those rates.

1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:45.020
Thank you. Diane Crest.

1:01:47.300 --> 1:01:48.640
Diane Cress.

1:01:51.620 --> 1:01:54.656
Doug, turn your camera off. We love you, but we don't love

1:01:54.678 --> 1:01:58.500
you that much. Diane Cress.

1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:06.020
Diane Cress.

1:02:11.980 --> 1:02:15.000
Brown. Doris Brown.

1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:17.370
Okay, keep going.

1:02:19.980 --> 1:02:23.580
Becky Seal. I'm sorry. You, miss Brown.

1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:27.464
My apologies. Come on forward. We'll have Ms.

1:02:27.512 --> 1:02:30.780
Doris Brown followed missed by Miss Becky Seal.

1:02:45.190 --> 1:02:49.694
My name is Doris Brown, and I'd like to address the historic disinvestment

1:02:49.742 --> 1:02:54.120
in our bipartisan neighborhoods. For years,

1:02:56.090 --> 1:02:59.202
we have lived with the threat of flooding.

1:02:59.266 --> 1:03:02.406
It has come to the point to where we are anxious when it start to

1:03:02.428 --> 1:03:06.730
rain. Excuse me?

1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:11.130
It has come to the point when we get anxious and we get varied.

1:03:11.790 --> 1:03:15.370
It's kind of like post traumatic distress.

1:03:16.770 --> 1:03:20.814
When it rains, we get anxious. We get scared because

1:03:20.852 --> 1:03:23.280
we know that our streets are going to hold water.

1:03:25.250 --> 1:03:29.006
We have been historically disinvested and

1:03:29.028 --> 1:03:32.594
disenfranchised. We would like to have an amendment for

1:03:32.632 --> 1:03:36.046
the public works to have more money so they could do something about the flooding

1:03:36.078 --> 1:03:39.506
in our bipartisan neighborhoods. Not only that, we want

1:03:39.608 --> 1:03:43.174
to address the worst first. We would like for someone to come

1:03:43.212 --> 1:03:47.138
out to our neighborhoods and start doing some work that alleviate

1:03:47.154 --> 1:03:48.920
the flooding that's going on.

1:03:51.290 --> 1:03:55.126
I'll give you another couple of seconds. Could you define your

1:03:55.148 --> 1:04:00.602
neighborhood? My neighborhood is City

1:04:00.656 --> 1:04:05.066
Gas Lakewood. The northeast neighborhood. Got it. District B,

1:04:05.248 --> 1:04:09.034
we have 88% of open dish

1:04:09.082 --> 1:04:12.606
drainage, and we just need

1:04:12.628 --> 1:04:16.750
some help out there. We need some infrastructure because the infrastructure is antiquated,

1:04:17.890 --> 1:04:20.414
right? Yes. We're the worst first.

1:04:20.612 --> 1:04:23.390
Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Brown.

1:04:27.650 --> 1:04:30.946
Ms. Brown. Ms. Brown. Thank council Member Jackson. Thank you,

1:04:30.968 --> 1:04:34.974
Ms. Brown, for coming in and for your group,

1:04:35.112 --> 1:04:38.242
for all the work that you guys been doing in the district

1:04:38.386 --> 1:04:41.846
to make sure that we get the resources and get the projects we

1:04:41.868 --> 1:04:45.174
need to mitigate the flooding within District B.

1:04:45.292 --> 1:04:48.806
The neighborhoods are the Northeast, Houston. You have cashmere? Garden,

1:04:48.838 --> 1:04:52.166
Fifth Ward Acres Homes. And so these are neighborhoods that's

1:04:52.198 --> 1:04:55.306
hit hard every flood. 88% of the

1:04:55.328 --> 1:04:59.226
open ditches are in our district. That was a ditch study conducted

1:04:59.258 --> 1:05:02.762
back in 2014 out of the Hurricane Ike

1:05:02.826 --> 1:05:06.478
Disaster Recovery Round $2 that indicated that we needed

1:05:06.644 --> 1:05:10.030
some investment within our neighborhoods. And so I assure you that

1:05:10.100 --> 1:05:13.266
it's my priority. I will be submitting amendment to make sure that

1:05:13.288 --> 1:05:16.782
we get the resources, some dollars allocated

1:05:16.846 --> 1:05:20.338
for ditch maintenance, because if our ditches are not and our drainages are

1:05:20.344 --> 1:05:24.138
not maintenance, that's what causes a lot of the flooding. And we can't

1:05:24.254 --> 1:05:27.526
depend on seniors to do something that

1:05:27.708 --> 1:05:31.106
we should be doing. We were doing it at one point. That changed

1:05:31.138 --> 1:05:34.906
in 2001. And so I'm going to make

1:05:34.928 --> 1:05:38.922
sure that we try to get a drainage schedule maintenance regularly within

1:05:38.976 --> 1:05:42.140
our district. So thank you all for your advocacy. Thank you.

1:05:42.990 --> 1:05:46.330
Thank you. Ms. Becky Seal.

1:05:49.930 --> 1:05:53.686
Morning. Hey, good morning.

1:05:53.788 --> 1:05:57.338
I'm Becky Seal with the Northeast Action Collective. And Doris and

1:05:57.344 --> 1:06:01.146
all these people talking that packet we just passed out to you kind of,

1:06:01.168 --> 1:06:04.686
like, elaborates a bit on why we're working with Tarsha to do this

1:06:04.708 --> 1:06:08.160
budget amendment and really the details of what we're talking about.

1:06:08.610 --> 1:06:12.286
So I heard you guys say that there is money for

1:06:12.308 --> 1:06:15.874
drainage maintenance right now, and we'd like to know if that's different than

1:06:15.912 --> 1:06:19.346
previous years, because the maintenance to this point really

1:06:19.528 --> 1:06:23.506
is not matching the need at all. And if so

1:06:23.608 --> 1:06:27.394
or regardless, where can the public see a schedule so that we can keep

1:06:27.432 --> 1:06:30.950
public works accountable to that? So let me ask this question.

1:06:31.100 --> 1:06:34.786
So we're dealing with general fund right now. I think that's dealing

1:06:34.818 --> 1:06:38.466
with capital improvement project dollars. So two different things.

1:06:38.588 --> 1:06:42.186
We will attack CIP probably next month or

1:06:42.208 --> 1:06:46.346
so. So if an amendment comes forward within the general fund,

1:06:46.528 --> 1:06:50.826
there has to be a correspondent debit that

1:06:50.848 --> 1:06:54.986
you take away from it and a funding source that's identified. And Council Member Jackson

1:06:55.018 --> 1:06:58.090
will probably submit that as well with her amendment.

1:06:58.170 --> 1:07:01.518
But we will take up CIP. Am I correct in that?

1:07:01.604 --> 1:07:05.134
Well, it's both. So there is an O and M

1:07:05.172 --> 1:07:08.206
component to this. And I do want to clarify,

1:07:08.398 --> 1:07:12.242
and I hope you will acknowledge that Veronica Davis and her team

1:07:12.296 --> 1:07:16.110
have been very actively engaged with this community over the last year

1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:21.858
and have worked with you to identify specific locations.

1:07:22.034 --> 1:07:25.698
We have actually done surveys of the roadside ditches throughout

1:07:25.714 --> 1:07:29.826
the area, and we've identified, I believe, 25 different projects

1:07:29.858 --> 1:07:33.034
that we'll be doing over the next 18 months in that area that

1:07:33.072 --> 1:07:35.930
are in our budget that are funded to be done.

1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:40.042
And so I want to make sure that it's clear that we have

1:07:40.096 --> 1:07:43.458
responded to, that we are actively but that's

1:07:43.494 --> 1:07:46.954
just the first step. Those are the ones that you all have identified

1:07:47.002 --> 1:07:50.558
that, you know, we're looking at the entire

1:07:50.644 --> 1:07:54.446
area out there and working to identify those improvements. So we've

1:07:54.478 --> 1:07:58.146
also done the maintenance through the entire area of

1:07:58.168 --> 1:08:01.618
everything that has been identified to us. And there's a

1:08:01.624 --> 1:08:05.634
difference between true maintenance, where it's actually

1:08:05.752 --> 1:08:09.746
going out, and removing silt and soil and things in those ditches and restoring

1:08:09.778 --> 1:08:13.334
culverts versus day to day, like,

1:08:13.372 --> 1:08:17.126
I take care of my house, which is making sure

1:08:17.148 --> 1:08:22.166
that the litter is not getting there, and things of that nature throughout

1:08:22.198 --> 1:08:25.610
the city. What we ask people to do is that

1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:29.302
light level maintenance, not that heavy maintenance

1:08:29.366 --> 1:08:33.286
that we do. So we've been working with Veronica

1:08:33.318 --> 1:08:36.686
Davis a lot. Right. And what she's told us is that the

1:08:36.788 --> 1:08:40.382
money that they have to do proactive maintenance is not nearly enough,

1:08:40.436 --> 1:08:44.062
that it's 500 miles of open ditch drainage throughout the entire city

1:08:44.116 --> 1:08:47.966
per year. And she has said, unless we have more money put aside

1:08:47.998 --> 1:08:51.758
for this, we cannot do the maintenance required. And we don't

1:08:51.774 --> 1:08:55.314
think that the only ditches that should be maintained is from a group

1:08:55.352 --> 1:08:58.606
of us who semi professionally come to city council

1:08:58.638 --> 1:09:01.510
and have to put our entire lives into identifying ditches.

1:09:02.250 --> 1:09:05.446
Yes, there's been a massive improvement, and it's been amazing to work

1:09:05.468 --> 1:09:09.046
with Veronica Davis. We've really liked working with her and appreciated the

1:09:09.068 --> 1:09:12.618
response. But we think that there has to be a shift from

1:09:12.704 --> 1:09:16.426
that pattern to being more proactive. And she specifically has said the

1:09:16.448 --> 1:09:19.946
only way that's possible is if there's more money specifically put for

1:09:19.968 --> 1:09:23.226
that. Yes. And Miss Seal, if you want

1:09:23.248 --> 1:09:27.118
to look up the CIP map that we have,

1:09:27.204 --> 1:09:30.618
it can be found@buildhoustonforward.org. And you'll

1:09:30.634 --> 1:09:33.998
see the CIP. Yeah, we've looked at it a lot. But the CIP projects is

1:09:34.004 --> 1:09:37.842
not what we're talking about. We're not talking there are two buckets of

1:09:37.976 --> 1:09:41.838
projects. One is general fund and one in CIP. So we'll

1:09:41.854 --> 1:09:45.330
get to CIP, but your general fund. Okay.

1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:49.326
But in either one, you can't see what the actual money for

1:09:49.368 --> 1:09:52.658
ditch maintenance is. And we've scoured the Internet. If it's

1:09:52.674 --> 1:09:55.942
out there, please send it to us. We're trying to see if there's money

1:09:55.996 --> 1:09:59.622
in one of those overall city

1:09:59.676 --> 1:10:03.702
line in the CIP budget that's going to ditch maintenance.

1:10:03.766 --> 1:10:07.466
What does that mean? And then in the general fund, same thing. So that we

1:10:07.488 --> 1:10:11.206
can if it's already happening spectacular,

1:10:11.318 --> 1:10:14.990
we just want to see it and understand. Council member Tiffany Thomas.

1:10:15.490 --> 1:10:19.098
Thank you. In addition to the budget amendment

1:10:19.194 --> 1:10:22.442
your council member is going to offer, last year council Member Peck,

1:10:22.586 --> 1:10:26.206
during budget last year authored an amendment for council

1:10:26.238 --> 1:10:29.726
members to leverage council district service funds

1:10:29.838 --> 1:10:33.506
to maintain open ditches in our district. And I know

1:10:33.528 --> 1:10:37.106
she's had some successes with that. So in addition to

1:10:37.128 --> 1:10:40.726
that, your council member can couple the work around the timeline and the

1:10:40.748 --> 1:10:44.230
schedule that you're requesting, but then also leveraging some of the dollars

1:10:44.300 --> 1:10:47.794
she has locally to make sure that the funding

1:10:47.842 --> 1:10:51.286
that TDO is limited. To do that, the council

1:10:51.318 --> 1:10:55.034
office can support. That's been great, and you talk

1:10:55.072 --> 1:10:58.314
too, but Ms. Jackson has done a lot with that.

1:10:58.352 --> 1:11:02.026
But that statistic Doris pointed out, 88% of open ditch

1:11:02.058 --> 1:11:05.342
maintenance is in non white

1:11:05.396 --> 1:11:09.406
and poor neighborhoods, basically. So every city district having

1:11:09.508 --> 1:11:12.574
some money to put to that doesn't nearly address the problem.

1:11:12.692 --> 1:11:16.398
It's an unequal problem. So there has to be what

1:11:16.404 --> 1:11:19.390
I'm clarifying is that you have additional method.

1:11:19.470 --> 1:11:22.642
So it's and in both. So in addition to what's showing up in the general

1:11:22.696 --> 1:11:25.938
fund and the budget amendment for a timeline, she actually all of

1:11:25.944 --> 1:11:29.666
us have dollars available to support that where TDO

1:11:29.698 --> 1:11:33.142
is limited. So it's and in both. Thank you. Thank you.

1:11:33.196 --> 1:11:37.074
Thank you, Miss Sale. Next, we have Ms. Carolyn Addison

1:11:37.122 --> 1:11:37.910
Rivera.

1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:51.968
Good morning. What you see here are recent

1:11:52.144 --> 1:11:56.264
pictures of the ditches that

1:11:56.302 --> 1:11:59.832
we live in and the contamination that

1:11:59.886 --> 1:12:03.672
we deal with with water and our

1:12:03.726 --> 1:12:07.496
land. The first thing I want to do is say thank you.

1:12:07.678 --> 1:12:10.764
Okay. The first thing I want thank you, sir.

1:12:10.882 --> 1:12:14.252
Yes, ma'am. The first thing I want to do is say

1:12:14.306 --> 1:12:17.804
thank you to the city council and

1:12:17.842 --> 1:12:21.090
to let you know that we need you.

1:12:21.460 --> 1:12:25.570
We cannot. This is recent. If you can see this,

1:12:26.020 --> 1:12:30.368
this is what we live with every day.

1:12:30.534 --> 1:12:35.136
I have been calling Veronica

1:12:35.168 --> 1:12:38.740
Davis and the rest of since 2014,

1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:42.550
pleading for help. I've lived in that community

1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:46.324
over 40 years. When I moved

1:12:46.372 --> 1:12:49.236
there, there was regular maintenance.

1:12:49.428 --> 1:12:53.544
We had no flooding. My children could play.

1:12:53.742 --> 1:12:56.840
This was not in our community.

1:12:56.990 --> 1:13:00.568
This is reason. Just yesterday,

1:13:00.744 --> 1:13:03.516
I called and the guy come out,

1:13:03.618 --> 1:13:06.940
asked me, what do I want him to do? They dig

1:13:07.010 --> 1:13:10.364
ditches. Well water. Just stand. Do you hear

1:13:10.402 --> 1:13:13.488
me? It just stand. Thank you. Thank you.

1:13:13.494 --> 1:13:17.072
Ms. Addison Rivera. Thank you. And thank you very

1:13:17.126 --> 1:13:20.816
much. We need you. We can't do it without you.

1:13:20.918 --> 1:13:23.936
This is it reason. Thank you,

1:13:23.958 --> 1:13:27.760
ma'am. Appreciate it. Leah Johnson.

1:13:29.380 --> 1:13:30.800
Leah Johnson.

1:13:32.180 --> 1:13:33.760
Benjamin Broadway.

1:13:35.060 --> 1:13:36.650
Thank American.

1:14:09.330 --> 1:14:11.840
Mr. Broadway. Morning, sir.

1:14:18.550 --> 1:14:21.300
There you go. We're good. Okay. Thank you.

1:14:21.830 --> 1:14:24.894
I'm going to get straight to the point. In the Northeast,

1:14:24.942 --> 1:14:29.046
we need sewage and

1:14:29.228 --> 1:14:33.270
runoff. Help our kids stand

1:14:33.340 --> 1:14:36.678
in water when they're waiting for the school bus.

1:14:36.764 --> 1:14:41.286
Do your kids wait and stand in water? They get to school soaking

1:14:41.318 --> 1:14:45.114
wet. We need flood help

1:14:45.312 --> 1:14:48.570
in our area. We need the covered ditches.

1:14:48.990 --> 1:14:52.560
Three, one, one is a joke to me

1:14:53.250 --> 1:14:56.766
because when I call for help, they have

1:14:56.788 --> 1:15:00.366
us register. Every year, every time we move, when the

1:15:00.388 --> 1:15:03.914
disabled and visually impaired people relocate,

1:15:03.962 --> 1:15:07.426
they ask us to register. I register. I've never

1:15:07.528 --> 1:15:11.154
gotten one call from three one one to say,

1:15:11.272 --> 1:15:15.646
hello. Mr. Broadway. Are you okay? Do you need to evacuate?

1:15:15.838 --> 1:15:19.574
My family has had to come in high water vehicles to

1:15:19.612 --> 1:15:23.240
come and get me from my home. So please,

1:15:23.610 --> 1:15:28.386
with your help help. District B, I'm in Lakewood.

1:15:28.578 --> 1:15:32.380
I'm one of many disabled people that need the help.

1:15:35.870 --> 1:15:39.562
Thank you, Mr. Broadway, would you like a couple of seconds of my time to

1:15:39.616 --> 1:15:42.654
complete your statement? Yes.

1:15:42.772 --> 1:15:46.766
If there's any way we can try and make the system

1:15:46.868 --> 1:15:50.158
better, because every time we call

1:15:50.244 --> 1:15:53.722
with even simple things of loose

1:15:53.786 --> 1:15:57.426
animals because I can't walk to my mailbox without trying

1:15:57.448 --> 1:15:59.140
to get attacked by a dog,

1:16:00.870 --> 1:16:04.590
and the flooding issues, here I am facing

1:16:04.670 --> 1:16:08.034
another hurricane season. I'm terrified from

1:16:08.072 --> 1:16:11.846
a small rain. I don't know if my area is

1:16:11.868 --> 1:16:15.222
going to flood because the covered ditches, they have

1:16:15.276 --> 1:16:19.126
so much in them. Thank you. Council member Tasha Jackson. I just

1:16:19.148 --> 1:16:23.014
wanted to thank them for coming in and sharing their concerns.

1:16:23.062 --> 1:16:26.618
And then also just to piggyback on what Director Haddock did

1:16:26.704 --> 1:16:30.122
say about the SWAT projects slated for the area,

1:16:30.176 --> 1:16:33.738
and we doing the H and H studies. I think we just completed the

1:16:33.744 --> 1:16:37.706
H and H studies to actually show why these particular neighborhoods

1:16:37.738 --> 1:16:41.258
are draining. I mean, it's true that there has been no investment,

1:16:41.434 --> 1:16:44.734
why these neighborhoods are flooding. There has been no investment. And now we are

1:16:44.772 --> 1:16:48.930
getting the studies to identify why these neighborhoods are flooding. And then

1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:52.526
the next round is the fixing, the mitigating, these flooding.

1:16:52.558 --> 1:16:55.902
I mean, we have train tracks. We're always talking about the trains that's

1:16:55.966 --> 1:16:59.266
contributing to a lot of the flooding. So I just want to assure you that

1:16:59.288 --> 1:17:02.566
there has been a lot of movement and we're doing a lot of work.

1:17:02.668 --> 1:17:06.194
We had a lot of projects slated for the district to address the flooding.

1:17:06.242 --> 1:17:10.434
But then also, we do need a ditch maintenance

1:17:10.482 --> 1:17:13.926
schedule. So I'm with you on that. And, of course, Director Haddock said there's

1:17:13.958 --> 1:17:17.318
resources already in this budget for that. And so I'm

1:17:17.334 --> 1:17:21.066
going to have further conversations just to identify what is the amount, how much

1:17:21.088 --> 1:17:23.990
do it cost. If I have to use some of my district service funds,

1:17:24.070 --> 1:17:27.478
I will use some of my district service funds, but I have to use for

1:17:27.504 --> 1:17:31.390
parks and the illegal dumping and all these other things. So a million

1:17:31.460 --> 1:17:35.466
dollars only goes so far. So I want to try to work with the departments

1:17:35.498 --> 1:17:38.546
and see if we can find resources to move some of these projects. So thank

1:17:38.568 --> 1:17:41.858
you again for coming. Thank you. Thank you, Chair, and thank you,

1:17:41.864 --> 1:17:45.634
sir, for coming. This question is for the Public Works Director. So the

1:17:45.672 --> 1:17:49.570
document they provided, it said prior to 2001,

1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:53.410
we did regular maintenance. The city did regular maintenance of

1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:57.314
roadside ditches. And now

1:17:57.352 --> 1:18:00.250
we just go based on three one on complaints.

1:18:01.150 --> 1:18:04.650
Did the city ever have a policy where we regularly maintained,

1:18:05.230 --> 1:18:07.946
I'll be honest with you, council Member, I do not know the answer to that

1:18:07.968 --> 1:18:11.478
question. I'm going to have to get with and Eric Dargan joined

1:18:11.494 --> 1:18:16.160
the city in 2002. I joined in 2005.

1:18:19.010 --> 1:18:22.880
I'm unaware of that. But I also do know that

1:18:24.610 --> 1:18:28.130
there were a lot of things that in the late ninety s and early

1:18:28.200 --> 1:18:31.698
2000s, because of the limitations on

1:18:31.704 --> 1:18:34.900
the general fund, which at the time was in the general fund,

1:18:36.630 --> 1:18:39.526
were not able to continue forward. So I do not know the answer to that

1:18:39.548 --> 1:18:43.606
question because I've always been under the impression we did more major

1:18:43.708 --> 1:18:47.122
regrading and things like that on a regular schedule. But the maintenance

1:18:47.186 --> 1:18:50.886
itself, like the mowing, I mean, these pictures are way more

1:18:50.908 --> 1:18:53.500
than just mowing needed. I mean, that's a different situation.

1:18:53.870 --> 1:18:57.020
But that was the property owner's responsibility. Thank you.

1:18:58.190 --> 1:19:00.010
Malberth Moses.

1:19:09.250 --> 1:19:10.240
Good morning.

1:19:13.090 --> 1:19:16.686
I don't understand why I'm have to come up here and fight for what's

1:19:16.718 --> 1:19:18.740
supposed to be our rights in the first place.

1:19:20.470 --> 1:19:24.242
I moved in my neighborhood over 50

1:19:24.296 --> 1:19:27.570
years ago and it was predominantly white neighborhood.

1:19:27.730 --> 1:19:31.350
I couldn't even go outside the plate till you choose because being

1:19:31.420 --> 1:19:35.298
attacked. But they had a regular schedule

1:19:35.474 --> 1:19:38.966
of keeping up the ditch maintenance, picking up the

1:19:38.988 --> 1:19:43.174
heavy trash. But then as the neighborhood began

1:19:43.222 --> 1:19:47.898
to grow more black

1:19:47.984 --> 1:19:50.890
and brown, all of a sudden this stopped.

1:19:51.790 --> 1:19:55.586
And I don't see why all stopped all of

1:19:55.588 --> 1:19:59.306
a sudden. Why we just got took off the schedule

1:19:59.498 --> 1:20:03.374
altogether. I haven't seen anybody come in that neighborhood in

1:20:03.412 --> 1:20:07.438
over 20 years to clean the ditches. And that's

1:20:07.454 --> 1:20:10.900
ridiculous because we deserve that, right?

1:20:12.310 --> 1:20:15.826
So can somebody answer that question? Why do

1:20:15.848 --> 1:20:19.058
I have to come up here and fight for a right that I already deserve?

1:20:19.154 --> 1:20:22.546
Thank you, Mr. Moses. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

1:20:22.738 --> 1:20:25.320
I'm sorry. Thank you.

1:20:26.570 --> 1:20:29.190
I'm sorry. Vice chair, Ed Pollard.

1:20:29.550 --> 1:20:31.530
Thank you sir, for coming in. Your comment,

1:20:32.990 --> 1:20:36.822
this is for public Works. When you all are going out and identifying

1:20:36.886 --> 1:20:40.234
projects and infrastructure needs for

1:20:40.272 --> 1:20:43.662
improvements to the drainage, or is there

1:20:43.716 --> 1:20:47.120
some type of list

1:20:47.490 --> 1:20:50.800
that you all have put together to

1:20:51.330 --> 1:20:55.162
be able to understand what are the drainage and infrastructure

1:20:55.226 --> 1:20:58.626
needs for that particular area? Has that been

1:20:58.648 --> 1:21:02.482
shared to the public? Do we have a cost estimate for

1:21:02.616 --> 1:21:06.302
some of those improvements so that we as council can be better abreast

1:21:06.366 --> 1:21:10.194
on what could be done to alleviate

1:21:10.242 --> 1:21:13.858
some of these issues? That the community I will interject.

1:21:13.954 --> 1:21:17.394
Each district gets $2 million in SWAT projects designated

1:21:17.442 --> 1:21:21.042
by their council members. I know we do that. And every other district receives

1:21:21.106 --> 1:21:25.014
2 million in SWAT projects. I'm not sure where your neighbor is on the District

1:21:25.062 --> 1:21:28.938
B project list, but we do have the ability to do that what

1:21:28.944 --> 1:21:32.738
I'm speaking of is just general, not swap

1:21:32.774 --> 1:21:36.586
projects because those are smaller, like 2 million a year projects.

1:21:36.618 --> 1:21:40.590
What I'm saying is like an overall high level view of

1:21:40.740 --> 1:21:43.946
infrastructure needs when it pertains to drainage

1:21:43.978 --> 1:21:48.050
and maintenance for an area like District B that has a lot of open ditches.

1:21:48.470 --> 1:21:52.034
So I may ask Veronica to come up and join us,

1:21:52.072 --> 1:21:55.442
but it's been in the last

1:21:55.496 --> 1:21:58.886
decade through this administration that we've actually gone out

1:21:58.908 --> 1:22:02.166
and surveyed Ditches Citywide to have an idea on what the

1:22:02.188 --> 1:22:06.358
capacity of those ditches are. And we're currently

1:22:06.524 --> 1:22:09.890
working on a condition assessment for Ditches Citywide,

1:22:09.970 --> 1:22:13.926
which would give us more of that answer. We did have from the late

1:22:13.958 --> 1:22:17.846
90s, early two thousand s, a capacity assessment

1:22:17.878 --> 1:22:21.500
of the Pipe Systems Citywide. And so this is

1:22:21.870 --> 1:22:25.134
that data driving. And so to be

1:22:25.172 --> 1:22:27.840
more proactive, you have to have that citywide data.

1:22:29.250 --> 1:22:32.478
In lieu of having that data. We did rely a

1:22:32.484 --> 1:22:36.046
lot on the three one one reports, and that's what we're working with the

1:22:36.068 --> 1:22:39.186
council member right now. When would the

1:22:39.208 --> 1:22:43.410
data be available for you all to do an assessment?

1:22:43.910 --> 1:22:47.602
Good morning, everyone. Well, good afternoon at this point. So.

1:22:47.656 --> 1:22:51.266
Veronica Davis, director of Transportation and Drainage operations in Houston

1:22:51.298 --> 1:22:54.994
Public Works. So one, we're working on our stormwater master

1:22:55.042 --> 1:22:58.166
plan. So the city up until now has never had a full

1:22:58.268 --> 1:23:01.430
master plan. So currently, right now,

1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:04.300
we should be going to a notice to proceed very soon.

1:23:04.670 --> 1:23:07.882
And so there'll be a couple of components with that. So part of it will

1:23:07.936 --> 1:23:11.494
be doing an H and H hydraulics analysis

1:23:11.542 --> 1:23:14.874
for the city to be able to understand these needs,

1:23:15.072 --> 1:23:18.702
and then two, to be able to think about what is the full

1:23:18.836 --> 1:23:22.718
need that we have for the city. We have have other plans that

1:23:22.724 --> 1:23:26.526
have been done that we will pull into this process to help inform

1:23:26.628 --> 1:23:31.214
some of that. And I also want to clarify what we do generally,

1:23:31.262 --> 1:23:34.606
we do rely on three one one right now for digit maintenance.

1:23:34.718 --> 1:23:38.466
And so we do send our digital maintenance crews out to do the regrading to

1:23:38.488 --> 1:23:42.134
do the desilting. Once it is beyond the ability of our

1:23:42.172 --> 1:23:45.810
internal crews to do, we do refer it to either SWAT,

1:23:45.890 --> 1:23:50.166
which we work with the council members on. We also have the local drainage program.

1:23:50.268 --> 1:23:53.714
And so we have been working with the Northeast Action Collective.

1:23:53.842 --> 1:23:57.466
We have projects right now that are indesigned. We do our design in house.

1:23:57.648 --> 1:24:01.338
So we are currently working on projects that are indesigned. And in the

1:24:01.344 --> 1:24:04.606
new fiscal year, we'll be going to construction to address some of the

1:24:04.628 --> 1:24:08.110
concerns that have been brought up by the collective.

1:24:08.450 --> 1:24:11.310
Thank you, Ms. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Moses.

1:24:11.970 --> 1:24:15.614
Council Member David Robinson. I'm sorry, this one was with Mr.

1:24:15.652 --> 1:24:18.878
Moses in mind, but basically a comment wanting

1:24:18.894 --> 1:24:22.402
to thank the Northeast Action Collective for being here.

1:24:22.456 --> 1:24:25.934
I think in addition to what we just heard from Ms. Davis and the director.

1:24:25.982 --> 1:24:29.410
I think there are some really positive trends.

1:24:29.490 --> 1:24:33.478
This is slow coming. And your patience and observations in

1:24:33.484 --> 1:24:36.562
the neighborhood, we understand why that's a grievance,

1:24:36.626 --> 1:24:40.210
why that's not fair and not right and not satisfactory.

1:24:40.290 --> 1:24:44.060
So I think moving forward, what we've heard today are some of the very

1:24:44.430 --> 1:24:48.214
progressive actions that are being taken. They need to happen faster,

1:24:48.262 --> 1:24:51.306
in my opinion. And part of what we're doing together,

1:24:51.408 --> 1:24:54.638
with your input, with your group and with some of the

1:24:54.644 --> 1:24:59.066
tools that the Director mentioned is detect problems sooner,

1:24:59.178 --> 1:25:02.942
work on them more proactively, with an inventory of

1:25:02.996 --> 1:25:06.402
those ditches, those pipes, and where we can be

1:25:06.456 --> 1:25:10.258
more effective and more fair, more equitable with our dollars.

1:25:10.424 --> 1:25:14.562
And working across this huge city, But I think the

1:25:14.616 --> 1:25:17.922
literature that you all have brought today is really well done.

1:25:18.056 --> 1:25:21.334
It's compelling, it's instructive, and it

1:25:21.372 --> 1:25:25.042
points a path to where the worst first can be prioritized.

1:25:25.106 --> 1:25:28.246
So I want to salute you, Mr. Moses, and thank you for coming today.

1:25:28.348 --> 1:25:30.810
Thank you. James Burford.

1:25:44.020 --> 1:25:47.636
James Burford. Got you.

1:25:47.738 --> 1:25:49.060
Sandra Edwards.

1:26:05.230 --> 1:26:06.940
Good morning, everybody.

1:26:08.590 --> 1:26:11.162
I'm not going to even hold you all along because everything I want to say

1:26:11.216 --> 1:26:14.238
has been said, has been said already.

1:26:14.324 --> 1:26:17.534
This is just a map of the community in the neighborhood. I'm from I'm from

1:26:17.572 --> 1:26:21.534
two six. Okay, the council closed and all that good stuff. Okay, I just

1:26:21.572 --> 1:26:25.134
want to say one thing. You all need to put first things first.

1:26:25.172 --> 1:26:27.326
I know you all been hearing all this and I know you're tired of hearing

1:26:27.358 --> 1:26:30.546
all this because we're tired of saying it, but can you all put first things

1:26:30.568 --> 1:26:33.918
first? We didn't showed you the proof. That what we need. It's not like we're

1:26:33.934 --> 1:26:37.330
asking for it because this is just we feel we better. They think they better

1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:40.454
because they get everything that needs to come their way. For you to come to

1:26:40.492 --> 1:26:44.482
our area, can you put first things first? Come to our area, do some cleanup,

1:26:44.546 --> 1:26:47.722
clean some drainages. Maybe we won't flood so much and

1:26:47.776 --> 1:26:50.650
stop these people from going against us,

1:26:50.720 --> 1:26:54.262
our communities, and bringing in stuff that's going to make us flood,

1:26:54.406 --> 1:26:57.950
stopping up our drainages and everything. Just do the

1:26:58.020 --> 1:27:01.518
right thing for once. That's all I got to say. Do something right for a

1:27:01.524 --> 1:27:04.430
change. Thank you. Julia arduna.

1:27:05.810 --> 1:27:07.470
Julia Arduna.

1:27:08.850 --> 1:27:11.090
Anil Kapoor.

1:27:24.590 --> 1:27:28.842
Okay, thank you, council people, for having us

1:27:28.896 --> 1:27:32.394
come in today to speak and giving us a chance to speak.

1:27:32.592 --> 1:27:36.446
Before I talk, I do want to express my gratitude to

1:27:36.628 --> 1:27:40.318
Veronica Davis and her department. In a little less than a

1:27:40.324 --> 1:27:44.110
year, her and her office have been way more impactful

1:27:44.610 --> 1:27:47.762
for our neighborhood and our collective and

1:27:47.816 --> 1:27:51.074
the residents that have been there for over 20 years than any

1:27:51.112 --> 1:27:52.980
of the previous people in her position.

1:27:53.910 --> 1:27:57.270
Also want to thank Tasha Jackson for being open and working

1:27:57.340 --> 1:27:59.510
with us as well and being accessible.

1:28:00.810 --> 1:28:04.390
I just want to read this prepared statement.

1:28:06.250 --> 1:28:09.862
We would love for the city council to amend a public

1:28:09.916 --> 1:28:13.350
works budget to include a pilot program for drainage maintenance

1:28:13.430 --> 1:28:17.494
in district B. Specifically, it is one of the most flood prone areas

1:28:17.542 --> 1:28:21.606
and has very high concentrations of BIPOC and LMI

1:28:21.638 --> 1:28:25.914
people, as well as public housing. Open ditch drainage is an example of separate

1:28:25.962 --> 1:28:29.130
and unequal that leaves our communities vulnerable.

1:28:29.290 --> 1:28:33.310
It's essential that we invest before the next hurricane and disaster.

1:28:34.210 --> 1:28:37.250
Our seal thank you. Supposed to rise 18 inches. Thank you, sir.

1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:40.530
Thank you. Appreciate it. David espinoza.

1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:47.856
Have Mr. Espinoza, then followed by Mr. Butler, and that will conclude

1:28:47.888 --> 1:28:50.680
the public speakers. Mr. Espinoza.

1:28:51.900 --> 1:28:55.064
Good afternoon. My name is David. I'm from

1:28:55.102 --> 1:28:58.744
district b. I want to say that

1:28:58.782 --> 1:29:02.316
I used to be in just about the same predicament as my

1:29:02.338 --> 1:29:03.820
colleagues in the NAC.

1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:11.100
About a half a year ago, there was some development

1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.830
right along little York and epson road.

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:19.508
And around the same time, there was also commercial development.

1:29:19.544 --> 1:29:21.890
There was a couple of fast food places going up.

1:29:22.500 --> 1:29:26.320
And at the same time, there was a road maintenance,

1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:29.700
which came along with ditch maintenance.

1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:35.348
And my family saw a dramatic improvement from

1:29:35.434 --> 1:29:38.948
the flooding we got we used to have we couldn't get out of

1:29:38.954 --> 1:29:42.920
our neighborhood when it when it was flooded real bad. But that's proof

1:29:43.260 --> 1:29:46.756
that ditch maintenance widening ditches, making them deeper,

1:29:46.788 --> 1:29:50.824
cleaning them out, it's not regular, but we

1:29:50.862 --> 1:29:54.028
do our best to keep our trash out, me and

1:29:54.034 --> 1:29:57.500
my neighbors, and so far,

1:29:57.570 --> 1:30:01.020
we've been doing good so far, and I want to see that happening

1:30:01.090 --> 1:30:04.556
throughout the northeast with my fellow

1:30:04.588 --> 1:30:07.552
members, to see them live better. Thank you, Mr.

1:30:07.606 --> 1:30:09.490
Espinoza. Thank you,

1:30:10.740 --> 1:30:12.160
Mr. Butler.

1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:19.410
You're the last one we can say good morning to, so we will. Good morning.

1:30:22.500 --> 1:30:25.856
Good afternoon. My name

1:30:25.878 --> 1:30:28.850
is Broderick Butler, and I'm a resident of district b.

1:30:29.460 --> 1:30:33.184
Those are my neighbors, and our message is pretty consistent.

1:30:33.232 --> 1:30:37.700
Along with getting things done faster, we'd like for things to be done properly

1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:42.180
and consistently. Council member Robinson,

1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:46.344
with all due respect, this is the first time I'm hearing these

1:30:46.382 --> 1:30:50.564
staff names, and I've long since wanted the senior

1:30:50.692 --> 1:30:54.504
management to come to our district and talk to

1:30:54.542 --> 1:30:58.104
people on their level about a problem that you've

1:30:58.152 --> 1:31:01.404
heard from multiple people over a period of

1:31:01.442 --> 1:31:05.912
decades. So my questions directed to the director

1:31:05.976 --> 1:31:09.936
are, who makes the decision where money is

1:31:09.958 --> 1:31:13.760
spent in their department in regards to our district and

1:31:13.910 --> 1:31:18.000
infrastructure projects? I also want to know, again this question

1:31:18.070 --> 1:31:21.840
of scheduling. There are people that have lived in this community their entire

1:31:21.910 --> 1:31:25.156
lives, and they've seen things go away. They're not lying to

1:31:25.178 --> 1:31:28.916
you. Lastly, there's a water treatment plant. There's still

1:31:28.938 --> 1:31:32.276
a disconnect there's a water treatment plant that was created in the

1:31:32.298 --> 1:31:36.056
northeast. No one knows it even exists that lives in the

1:31:36.078 --> 1:31:38.970
northeast. So I would say to you,

1:31:39.340 --> 1:31:43.032
this department, while it has done a lot of good for

1:31:43.086 --> 1:31:46.716
us, we need some more reaching out to

1:31:46.738 --> 1:31:50.956
this community to talk about solving the problems

1:31:51.058 --> 1:31:54.872
that exist. Thank you. Thank you. And I have some additional

1:31:54.936 --> 1:31:57.020
questions that I'd like to submit in writing.

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:02.764
We will put those into SharePoint. That concludes the

1:32:02.802 --> 1:32:06.380
Houston Public Works Budget workshop. Thank you,

1:32:06.450 --> 1:32:10.212
Director Haddock. Thank you,

1:32:10.306 --> 1:32:13.264
Director Salanki. Appreciate your insight.
