1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,074
Abby came and shaking her head no, but I love droughts. Difference of opinion.

2
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:07,754
Thank you. We will now transition from parks and recreation

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,350
to Houston Police department.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,586
At this time, I would welcome Chief

5
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:18,586
Fender and Miss Rhonda. Smith, the CFO of Houston Police

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,378
Department, along with Chief Satterwhite.

7
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:26,390
Chief Slinkert. And I thought I saw Chief Jones as well.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,680
So good to see everybody.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,436
And of course, Ms. Rhonda Smith, the CFO. Chief, I saw

10
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:41,020
you in DC. You look good. How was that plane trip?

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,030
Oh, you're a smart man. Yeah.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,630
Good to see you.

13
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,644
I just want to thank each and every

14
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:24,132
council member for such support. It means

15
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:28,344
a lot having the opportunity to talk to chiefs all around the nation and

16
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:32,024
to have the support from the Horseshoe. It means a lot,

17
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:33,770
but we'll jump right into it.

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,364
Chief Troy Finner. And on behalf of the Houston Police Department,

19
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:43,516
I appreciate the opportunity to submit the HPD's

20
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:47,728
proposed budget budget for FY 2023.

21
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:51,556
Let me first say how proud I am to be the

22
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,260
police chief in this great city with this great department.

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,156
The benefit of the burian audience. HPD is the

24
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:02,856
largest agency in the state of Texas, fourth largest in the

25
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:06,756
nation. We have over I'm sorry, the fifth

26
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:09,464
largest in the nation. We have over 6100,

27
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:13,480
both classified and civilian employees.

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,976
Before moving forward, I'd like to acknowledge the men and women of the Houston

29
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:21,976
Police Department, but especially the executive staff and the budget

30
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:25,576
and finance staff who has worked so diligently to prepare

31
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:29,856
this presentation. This year began and

32
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,520
has been very challenging for us, as around

33
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,850
the nation, we lost some of our own family members.

34
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,476
But in Houston and Harris County,

35
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:43,780
there was a total of six. Now, last week,

36
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,504
seven line of duty deaths. We also faced

37
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:51,840
the challenge of increasing

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,110
crime. At the beginning of the year, especially,

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,770
my top priority is to address those.

40
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,116
The trends of increasing crime was to reduce

41
00:03:04,148 --> 00:03:07,900
the violent crime, enhance technology, and also

42
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,324
improve the staffing. Just want to say the

43
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:16,876
One Safe Houston initiative has been successful. We've been

44
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:20,944
doing an excellent job looking at the numbers. Every week those

45
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:24,496
numbers have been going down, and we've seen a reduction in

46
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:28,064
violent crime on a weekly basis. So, again, I want to thank

47
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:32,320
the mayor, I want to thank City Council for the additional

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,880
opera rescue funding and fighting crime and reducing

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,564
some of that crime and improving the quality of life.

50
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:44,584
I want to hit on one stat before

51
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:48,920
we move forward. In January,

52
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,480
as compared to the previous year, our homicide numbers

53
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,740
were over 70%. Today it's 7%.

54
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,532
And that is a direct result of

55
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:05,356
good policing, but also everybody

56
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,720
working together, our citizens and the criminal justice system

57
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,050
coming together. Technology.

58
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,320
We have secured the following major technology milestones.

59
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,196
Body warrant camera upgrades will allow us to

60
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,772
purchase the next well, 300 I'm sorry,

61
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:26,740
3500 next generation body worn cameras.

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,140
The HPD data center locate relocation.

63
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,808
We completely moved the HPD primary data center

64
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:40,410
to a shared space within the city data center.

65
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,000
We've moved over 300 servers.

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,136
We've implemented Shot spotters not only in the Southeast,

67
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:52,350
but also in the North Division. Now,

68
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,540
I'm sorry, our RMS system, we're in a quiet period,

69
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,480
but we have an RFP out.

70
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,684
That's all I'm going to say about that. But it will assist

71
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:11,060
us in our fight of violent crime.

72
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,848
We want to make our real time crime center a true strategic

73
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:21,184
decision support system. The expansion

74
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:24,584
of automated license plate readers in

75
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:27,992
high crime areas and also cameras. So we're looking,

76
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:31,336
and I want to thank certain council members for

77
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:34,972
funding that. It's something that we want

78
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:38,732
to move around the city, but it's not just the

79
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:42,476
responsibility of the city and taxpayers. We want to get

80
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:44,190
everybody on board on that.

81
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,624
We also, in terms of staffing, we have

82
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:53,676
to continue to fund the five academy

83
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,170
classes each year.

84
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,044
Also want to thank council for working on city

85
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:07,168
audience, for the Cadillac converter audience, the noise audits

86
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:10,992
audits. And also the exterior

87
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:14,388
security video camera audit audits.

88
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:19,064
And also the county for passing the 10%

89
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:22,040
bond for defendants charged with violent crime.

90
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,592
The presentation will begin with an overview of organizational structure.

91
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:35,644
For the sake of time, I will move through these slides quickly and answer any

92
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:38,540
questions at the end. Next slide.

93
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,560
This slide shows a current organization structure.

94
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,000
Next slide.

95
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,936
This slide is basically the addition of the executive

96
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:57,408
assistant Chief I'm sorry, the Executive chief, chief Slinker,

97
00:06:57,504 --> 00:07:01,140
which we added that new position at the beginning of my administration.

98
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,416
Next slide. This is

99
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:10,520
the office of the police, of the Chief of Police.

100
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,920
Everything that's up under my command. Next slide.

101
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,700
This slide, it looks at investigations and special operations.

102
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,420
It's under Chief Jones.

103
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,770
And the next slide is patrol operations on the chief satellite.

104
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,230
Next slide, please. This is a special fund.

105
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,308
In addition to our general funds, our organization

106
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:46,336
includes operations and special funds.

107
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:49,796
These are funds that are restricted. The money is

108
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:53,524
restricted for restricted use. I meant to say Ms. Smith will

109
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:56,260
go into further detail here just shortly.

110
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,696
Next slide. Want to look at the

111
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:04,004
breakdown of gender of our agency. The significant

112
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:07,544
thing about this slide is for cities of

113
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:11,416
over 1 million in population I'm

114
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:14,430
sorry, we move it. One more slide. One more.

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,990
Thank you.

116
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,720
For cities over 1 million in population.

117
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,348
And the police departments have 17%

118
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:30,708
female. HPD is also at 17%.

119
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:34,500
For the civilian, that's for classified. For the civilians,

120
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,524
we're at 68% as compared to the national average

121
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:41,050
of 66%.

122
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,936
HPD is one of the most diverse law enforcement agencies in

123
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,330
the nation. We're a majority I'm sorry. Next slide. Go to it.

124
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,264
HPD is one of the most diverse agencies

125
00:08:56,312 --> 00:09:00,052
in the nation. We are a majority minority police department

126
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:03,616
with 78.9% of the

127
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:08,060
civilians are minority, 60.9% of classified.

128
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,696
A closer breakdown of it looking at the classified side,

129
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:14,288
39% Caucasian,

130
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:17,460
31% Hispanic or Latino,

131
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,484
21% African American and

132
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:26,516
8% Asian. For the civilian workforce,

133
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:29,530
we have 45% African American,

134
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,716
21% White, 25% Latino

135
00:09:33,748 --> 00:09:36,280
Hispanic and then 8% Asian.

136
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,064
The department programming. I always like to state our mission statement.

137
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:46,636
Mission statement is to hang the quality of life in the

138
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:51,532
city of Houston by working cooperatively

139
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:55,452
with the public within the framework work of the US constitution

140
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,160
to enforce laws, preserve the peace,

141
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,680
reduce fear, and provide a safe environment.

142
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,500
Next slide.

143
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,896
Reducing violent crime is one of the mayor's highest

144
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:14,384
priorities, and we have made great strides in accomplishing

145
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:18,280
the goal. Despite financial challenges and staffing,

146
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,204
some of the core duties prevent

147
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:27,120
crime, respond to calls for service, conduct investigations,

148
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,380
arrest individuals suspected of committing crimes,

149
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,364
coordinate with Homeland Security activities, protect lives and

150
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:39,180
property during mass gathering and special events, and also enforcing traffic.

151
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,520
Next slide.

152
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,680
Department program continues statutory requirements of

153
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,644
delivery of services. The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure

154
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:55,396
and the city ordinance. Chapter 34, article two, defines the

155
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:57,860
duties of the Houston Police Department.

156
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,364
Recently, our team

157
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,400
published a five year strategic plan listing five

158
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,384
key organizational priorities. One was

159
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:15,224
public safety. Building community trust was two.

160
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,500
Three was professional development. Four was Operational

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,368
Excellence and five was productivity.

162
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:27,692
This budget proposal funding request for key

163
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:31,840
initiatives discussed in this plan, which are first

164
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,596
ePROs and that is employment programs

165
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,360
for retired officers.

166
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,836
42 individuals will come back as retired officers

167
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,552
and it will give us immediate assistance in investigations

168
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:48,944
and other administrative duties. Five cadet classes

169
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:52,624
budgeted for 75 per class. A gun

170
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:56,520
intelligence center. We're working with Atl to implement

171
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,712
a robust gun intelligence center. And also cell

172
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:04,708
phones. Continued cell phones for each classified

173
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:08,460
officer previously. This is funded by the

174
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,836
Cares Act. I would like

175
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:15,352
to now ask Ms. Smith, our Chief Financial

176
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:19,864
Officer, to provide an overview of the 2023

177
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,970
proposed budget. Thank you.

178
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,370
Thank you, Chief. Good morning everyone.

179
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,512
My name is Rhonda. Smith, as the chief has said.

180
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:33,928
And I am the deputy director for the Houston Police Department.

181
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,808
And I echo Chief Sinner's

182
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:41,456
sentiment in terms of working with such a great crew.

183
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:44,868
And so I want to take just a minute point of privilege to talk about

184
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:48,548
the Office of Budget and Finance who've been working tirelessly throughout

185
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:52,212
the year and particularly now for the budget presentation.

186
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:56,170
So I'm going to ask them just to stand so I can acknowledge them.

187
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,376
So we're always behind the scenes, so they are a little shy,

188
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:08,732
but thank you. So as we move forward, this first

189
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:12,344
slide is the revenue by fund. First, I'd like to just say that

190
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:15,628
the police department operates under six funds.

191
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:19,456
The primary fund is the general fund, which makes up about 97%

192
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:23,312
of our operations. The other funds are special funds. And so each

193
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:27,204
fund has a revenue component. And this is what you see here on this

194
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:31,328
slide. So for the first item, general fund and I'll

195
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:35,244
be speaking from the column that's titled Fiscal Year 23 proposed Budget

196
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:39,412
for the General Fund. The proposed revenue

197
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:42,952
anticipated is $43.5 million.

198
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:46,340
Now, it's revenue, but it's actually a reimbursement.

199
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,884
84% of that is the reimbursement that we receive from

200
00:13:49,922 --> 00:13:54,168
the airport systems. So we provide those services for intercontinental

201
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:56,430
hobby and the Ellington field.

202
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,396
The next item is our police special services

203
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:04,156
fund. This is a collection of special funds for restricted

204
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:07,600
use. For example, all of the training that we do that is

205
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,024
provided by the state flows through this fund,

206
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,836
reimbursement for what's called MoUs, or Memorandum of

207
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:19,024
Understanding, which we have with other agencies,

208
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:22,896
flow through this fund and funding for our combat

209
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:27,160
against human trafficking, as well as cost recovery services

210
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,800
and special funds and special events.

211
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,208
We anticipate that that budget would be 7.9 million.

212
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,208
And our next item, our special fund is auto dealers.

213
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:43,532
And for revenue for that one, we are anticipating 8.5

214
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,256
budgeted for the auto dealers. And of course, with auto

215
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:50,624
dealers, it's a standalone fund. And this fund

216
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:53,772
is responsible for regulating automotive businesses,

217
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:57,536
auto salespersons, storage lots, and towing industry. So the

218
00:14:57,558 --> 00:15:01,596
revenue we receive primarily is coming from fees that we charge

219
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:05,380
in servicing that process. Our next

220
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,012
item is child safety fund. And that's clearly just a flow through.

221
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:12,676
Just for by way of background, in 1991,

222
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:16,760
the state legislature required that any population over 850,000

223
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,424
should fund it. And we fund it through assessing certain

224
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:24,632
fees on municipal fines. And so what

225
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:27,816
we get, we pass back through. And if we don't get

226
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:31,340
enough, then there's no money else, no other

227
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,856
way to get the funding. And so that's what that child safety

228
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:38,492
fund is. And of course, asset forfeiture. So under

229
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:41,724
asset forfeiture. The one thing I'll say,

230
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:45,564
and I know my stuff is looking at me because we cannot budget

231
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:49,296
for asset forfeiture because it's on a

232
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,340
case by case basis other than the state allows us to do some budgeting.

233
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,716
But I will say that typically right now, we're budgeting $2 million,

234
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:01,632
which is, if you look in the history, it's a little lower than anticipated.

235
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:04,932
But what has happened is that we are taking

236
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:08,740
the same impact everyone else is with COVID and the court systems,

237
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,256
because in order to receive these funds, it has to flow through the

238
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,856
court system. So we're hoping that in time

239
00:16:17,038 --> 00:16:20,664
that we will be back on chart. And lastly

240
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:24,604
is the Forensic Transition fund. And that Forensic Transition Fund

241
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:28,924
that shows 373,000,000 is really just a flow through

242
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:32,832
because back in 2014, I believe we

243
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:37,120
transitioned the operations of the Forensic Fund to the local

244
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,492
government corporation. But we kept the funding,

245
00:16:40,556 --> 00:16:44,416
we kept the actual individuals that were associated

246
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:48,432
with HPD in our funding.

247
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:51,876
So we received reimbursement. So the good news is

248
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:55,444
it's doing what it's supposed to. It was a transition. It started with

249
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,584
probably more than 20. Now we only have three staff left.

250
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:02,472
So we anticipate over the next several years that that will move down.

251
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:05,928
So what we have in total is $65 million

252
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:08,430
for revenue. Next slide, please.

253
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,204
So this slide just highlights some of the reasons why

254
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:18,060
there's a difference from year to year and the comparison is

255
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,044
with the estimated revenue compared to the budget. So for General Fund

256
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,296
we're showing a $1.4 million increase. As I

257
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,448
mentioned before, 84% of the General Fund revenue has to

258
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:31,888
do with our services to the police, of services to the

259
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:35,684
airport system. So of course a lot of the increase has to do with the

260
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:39,472
contractual obligations. In reference to the 4% increase

261
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:42,660
for police and the 3% for civilian.

262
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,704
The one thing I will highlight that the one new add

263
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:51,252
on is seven positions anticipated

264
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:54,536
for the last five months of the fiscal year that have to do with the

265
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,436
integrated coordination center which is being created by the airport

266
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:01,532
system and they have requested our participation in that,

267
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:04,988
but of course they will be reimbursing us for it. So I'm going to

268
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:09,004
skip to auto dealers and you'll see a small decrease. But really

269
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:13,116
that's just because fiscal year 22 we saw uptick

270
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:17,440
in the increase of selling cars that have been stored

271
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,560
and the actual funding for that.

272
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,076
So we tend to budget pretty conservatively. So we've

273
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:27,492
gone back to what we typically would see

274
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:30,836
during a year. And the last item that I

275
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:34,180
will include is the forensic transition. But I've already explained that one

276
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,770
why that's going down, so next slide please.

277
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,024
So this is the expenditure by fund. So for General Fund,

278
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:47,800
the proposed budget is $988,000,000

279
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,148
or a difference of 33 million.

280
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:54,588
And I will explain that a little bit later

281
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:57,772
on and go into a little bit more detail. In terms of the general

282
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:00,968
budget for police special Fund, we have a

283
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:05,196
budget of $10.9 million and most of that is personnel.

284
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:09,280
But we do also have some increases because of technology

285
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,036
increase, technology enhancements that we are anticipating this fiscal

286
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:13,650
year.

287
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,696
The only other thing that I will focus on is asset forfeiture,

288
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:23,268
but I think I've kind of mentioned that before and why that number

289
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:26,772
appears to be going up, but we didn't spend as much last year,

290
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:30,392
but we do anticipate spending a little bit more this year. Thank you.

291
00:19:30,446 --> 00:19:34,516
Next slide please. This is the expenditure highlights

292
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,836
which shows the difference. As I mentioned with General Fund there's a $33 million

293
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:42,030
difference which I'll go in into the next slide and

294
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,736
I believe I've already explained the differences in the others. So I'll

295
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,110
move forward with the next slide please.

296
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,024
So this is the slide that explains

297
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:55,408
how we came up to the 988,000,000.

298
00:19:55,574 --> 00:20:00,896
If you recall, last year we had a budget adopted of 955,000,000 and

299
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:04,436
throughout the year there are adjustments to the budget. For example,

300
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:08,288
there are adjustments in the restricted funds that are shared

301
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:12,356
funds that we are provided that number from the

302
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,692
administration. And then we of course we have the adjustment for

303
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:20,424
the 3% increase for the Hope budget is

304
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:23,624
what I'd like to refer to as the three three three that we're all very

305
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:27,224
ecstatic to see happen. And then we

306
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:31,032
had a decrease in our health benefit. So that's

307
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,968
primarily because we had a lot of more attrition than anticipated.

308
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:38,456
So the budget was adjusted to reflect that decrease

309
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,700
for health benefits. Then of course we have the Council

310
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,256
council support monies that we've received about $129,000 and

311
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:53,796
then that gets you and, and of course I can't, I would be remiss if

312
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:58,070
I didn't add on that. We added the

313
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,364
gunshot detection with the shot spotter and

314
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:07,540
those are two locations at 350 each. So that's the 700,000.

315
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,932
So that gets us down to what we refer to as the current budget.

316
00:21:10,996 --> 00:21:14,536
And the current budget is just the adopted plus any adjustments we've made during the

317
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,344
year. And from there we get down to how we

318
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:22,300
came to the current budget, to the fiscal year budget.

319
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,316
And this pretty much shows you every item that has

320
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:30,430
been adjusted. A lot of it has to do with the Hope and

321
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,176
the contract with the police union HPU in

322
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:40,016
terms of the increases, the 4% and the 3%. And of course we had

323
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:43,010
an increase in the health care also.

324
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,284
So I'm not going to go through each one. I wanted to just highlight those

325
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:50,676
items that may bring up some question if you look

326
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:53,856
about halfway down there's, the Cadet

327
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:57,828
adjustment. So last year we had anticipated six classes,

328
00:21:57,924 --> 00:22:01,700
but we now know that filling up the five classes is our priority.

329
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,444
So we readjusted that down to five classes versus

330
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:09,544
six classes. And then the

331
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:13,356
last several items here, it's called approved PBJs and

332
00:22:13,378 --> 00:22:17,356
those are requests that we've made to adjust our budget. And I'm happy to

333
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:21,068
say that we had four this year. One had to do with the body worn

334
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:24,656
cameras, which was approved this last fiscal year. And this

335
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:28,304
1.8 represents the storage cost

336
00:22:28,422 --> 00:22:31,536
for the body worn cameras. And of course,

337
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,470
the Chief mentioned the ePRO program also.

338
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,870
Next slide, please.

339
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,156
So this slide represents the

340
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:46,880
balance between personnel cost and non personnel costs.

341
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,352
So interesting enough, we have 988,000,091%

342
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:55,464
of that pertains to personnel cost. Last year was about 92,

343
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:58,604
93%. And you may ask what's happened?

344
00:22:58,722 --> 00:23:02,540
Well, we've got the ePROs program and we also have

345
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,204
another program, I can't remember the name, but the other

346
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:09,964
program which actually has added to the other

347
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:13,088
side of it. So now it's 91%. So it's going in

348
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:15,890
the right direction. Next slide, please.

349
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,064
So I'm going to move through these pretty quickly because if you see with the

350
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:24,236
special funds, it's mostly 50 50, mostly personnel

351
00:23:24,348 --> 00:23:27,604
and non personnel, it's about 50 50. So with

352
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:31,780
the Police special fund it is 52% for personnel and

353
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,512
48% for non personnel and special

354
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:39,060
funds. A lot of the personnel has to do with overtime.

355
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,888
There are some staff, but it's primarily overtime cost

356
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,520
that we receive fund reimbursement for.

357
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,248
Next slide please. So this is asset forfeiture.

358
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:53,964
It's the same case as 50 50 just about and

359
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:57,608
that's personnel versus non personnel. So next slide

360
00:23:57,624 --> 00:24:00,720
please. And this is the auto dealers.

361
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,356
The same with this one in terms of personnel

362
00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:08,850
versus non personnel. Next slide please.

363
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,508
So we've put these two on the same slide. The first one is a

364
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:17,670
child safety and of course that's strictly a flow through. So it's 100%

365
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,212
or almost 100% flow through for

366
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:25,800
services and for the forensic, it's 100%

367
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,304
personnel. Next slide, please.

368
00:24:29,422 --> 00:24:33,032
So this gives you a historical factor in terms of how

369
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:36,436
we have fared in comparison with what we've spent

370
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:39,752
versus our adopted budget. And as you can see that

371
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:43,420
we typically come on budget. We spend a lot of time making

372
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,196
sure that we stay within our budget. We understand the budgets are

373
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:50,368
tight and we are fiscally responsible and we want to make

374
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:55,020
sure that we stand here. So this actual presentation

375
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,480
shows that in a graphical manner. Next slide.

376
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,544
So the next few slides you'll see that the adopted budget is

377
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:06,312
much more than the expenditures. A lot of times with the special funds,

378
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:10,020
if we do not have enough time to spend the money,

379
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,316
it's just rolled over to the next fiscal year and that's happened in

380
00:25:13,338 --> 00:25:17,290
the first five years of 2019 through 2023.

381
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,416
Next slide please. The same with asset forfeiture you'll see that

382
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,824
same trend, but we are working to make sure

383
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:28,636
that the revenue and the adopted budget and the

384
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:31,276
expenditures are in line,

385
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:34,350
but there are some times when we run out of time.

386
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,716
Next slide, please. And this is the

387
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,520
auto dealers, which is typically on target.

388
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,556
Next slide, please. And of course it's the child safety

389
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:51,040
which is a smaller funds.

390
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,396
Next slide. So with that, I'm going to pass it

391
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:59,190
back over to Chief if he'd like to close us out.

392
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,460
Just again, thanks for the support of

393
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,984
our council members and the citizens as well. But we really wanted

394
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:10,104
to kind of move through quickly because I wanted to save time for

395
00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:11,960
questions and answers.

396
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,640
Thanks again, Ms. Jones. And Chief Finner.

397
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,204
It's not every day that we have the opportunity to have you

398
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:27,656
and your command staff in front of us. So again, I'd like to recognize Chief

399
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:31,276
Slinkert, chief Jones and Chief Satellite, and also

400
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,784
Ray Hunt and Doug Griffin with HPOU who are

401
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:38,416
valuable partners not only to the police department but to the city council as

402
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:41,536
well. And also Mr. Peter Stout with the

403
00:26:41,638 --> 00:26:45,460
CEO of the Houston Forensic Science Lab. Our first question

404
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,860
comes from council member Abby Cayman.

405
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,876
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. And I have a list of questions, so just

406
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:55,656
go ahead and put me back in queue. Chief, first off, thank you

407
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:59,416
so much for your leadership and to the entire team all the

408
00:26:59,438 --> 00:27:02,664
way on down to each division as we

409
00:27:02,702 --> 00:27:06,504
continue to face not only the

410
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,156
surgeon violent crime following the pandemic locally. But could

411
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:13,180
you share what you're seeing? I know you were just in DC,

412
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,512
what that trip was about and what we're seeing nationally

413
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:21,504
and how what we are doing is either working or not

414
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:25,788
working. Thank you for asking. It was a good trip

415
00:27:25,964 --> 00:27:29,490
for not only me, but for the mayor and for our city

416
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,944
and visiting with the President, the Rescue

417
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:38,148
Act, he pledged to continue

418
00:27:38,234 --> 00:27:41,172
to fund us, and that was a huge thing.

419
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:45,456
But the meeting, first of all, I just want to say honor

420
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:49,000
to those men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice

421
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,976
during that weekend of memorial. But when

422
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:59,820
you're talking to other chiefs from around the nation, you understand

423
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,484
that everybody has the same problems, with one

424
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:07,484
exception. Nobody has the backlog problem that we have here in

425
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,896
Houston, Harris County. Absolutely nobody. And in

426
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:14,256
our conversations, they were amazed. But they're dealing with

427
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,880
some of the same other issues, the gun violence,

428
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,016
letting individuals out of jail when

429
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:25,680
they're repeating time and time, violent crime.

430
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,460
So that's the challenge. But also recruiting

431
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,084
and just hearing some of the things that they're doing. And I told

432
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:37,704
the mayor that I think I'll meet this Thursday. I want to talk to him

433
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:41,844
about some of the recruiting initiatives

434
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:45,944
that they are putting in place and also probably

435
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,812
using as more funding comes in,

436
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:53,096
using some of that for some incentives for individuals

437
00:28:53,128 --> 00:28:57,230
coming in to the academy or actually recruiting them.

438
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,984
Mentioned recruitment. There's been

439
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:05,312
conversations and questions about cadet classes. And I know you mentioned

440
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:09,264
in this budget there's five, is that correct? And could you

441
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:13,232
clarify, though, because we oftentimes talk about cadet classes,

442
00:29:13,296 --> 00:29:17,252
but we also are dealing with retention issues. So can you share

443
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:21,380
with us where that brings us in terms of HPD?

444
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,240
Yes, staffing, the recruiting,

445
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,244
we can always improve. But the biggest problem right now

446
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:34,280
is the Attrition Rate We're Agent Agency and

447
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,730
a lot of these individuals who are leaving when they get 35, 30 years,

448
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,404
it's hard to keep them when they're ready to go. So as we

449
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:47,224
put cadets in the class on the back end, people are retiring.

450
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:50,576
So that is a huge challenge right

451
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:53,920
now. So it's very important that

452
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,552
we just don't lose hope and understand and hoping that that

453
00:29:57,606 --> 00:30:00,844
time itself out as some of those retire

454
00:30:00,972 --> 00:30:04,384
and then other cadets come through

455
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:07,632
our academy and come on out on the streets.

456
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:10,724
Hopefully on the back end, in a few years, we'll be able to hold on

457
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:13,444
to a lot more for a longer time.

458
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:17,720
It's not just that we're adding additional numbers. We'll put you back in queue.

459
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,080
Council Member Sally Alcorn.

460
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,800
Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Chief, for the presentation.

461
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,740
I have a question about investigative and special operations.

462
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,296
I know there was talk about clearance rates and how we were doing better ten

463
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:37,768
years ago than we were doing now.

464
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:44,476
And we added, I thought some classifieds

465
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:48,320
to that division. It looks like we budgeted for more

466
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,696
last year and then hired fewer, and now we're trying to

467
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:55,156
get more. Can you talk a little bit about yeah, I'm proud to say

468
00:30:55,258 --> 00:30:59,104
that our clearance rate, divisional clearance rate and homicide

469
00:30:59,152 --> 00:31:01,430
is at 80% now. That's great.

470
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,890
When you looked at last year in 2020,

471
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,780
those numbers were down. So we're trending in the right direction.

472
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,732
I want to give credit to the great investigative

473
00:31:15,796 --> 00:31:19,292
work and also the leadership on the investigative side,

474
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:22,716
chief Jones and some of our other assistant chiefs and the

475
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:26,088
men and women who are doing just knockout investigations.

476
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,836
But again, people don't give

477
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:33,356
enough credit to the value of good relationships

478
00:31:33,468 --> 00:31:36,704
with citizens. And you see time and

479
00:31:36,742 --> 00:31:40,384
time again, citizens are stepping up more. And I think that's because

480
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:44,640
of a better relationship and more trust building

481
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,288
in. So it has to all gel together. But I'm

482
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:51,940
excited about it, and I just pray that we continue to trend that way.

483
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,870
That's great news. Good to hear. On the property room,

484
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,948
how many classifieds do we have working at the property room?

485
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:02,648
I'm not sure on that number. Does anybody have a property room?

486
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,988
And if not, we'll get that to you. Okay, that's great. And I'd

487
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:09,576
like to see, in addition to the clearance rate be put on the performance measures

488
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:13,596
that you all include in the book, the disposition of

489
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:17,564
property. I know what we receive in and what goes out.

490
00:32:17,762 --> 00:32:21,216
I think we're way in more. We have way

491
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:24,464
more in in all categories than than what goes out. And that

492
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:28,560
ties up a lot of officers. We include that council member Tiffany Thomas.

493
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,604
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. Hello, Chief. It's good to see you doing this morning.

494
00:32:34,742 --> 00:32:38,820
I'm well. So two questions. One's an aside from the general fund, I'm pretty clear

495
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,272
about how you're funded, but oftentimes we receive

496
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:46,152
grant where council approves grant award grant applications rather

497
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:49,732
to support the department. And I remember there was one item,

498
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:53,368
particularly that was almost like a community

499
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:57,192
mobile unit that was the

500
00:32:57,246 --> 00:33:00,876
application was supposed to use to

501
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:04,268
do some community efforts. When do we receive information

502
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:07,720
that the award was actually accepted or funded

503
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,116
and that those capital pieces of equipment are actually within our

504
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:14,764
hands? That mobile brand? I think that got it's.

505
00:33:14,812 --> 00:33:18,770
Chief Johnson. Commander Johnson. We just

506
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,388
put in for a year ago. Yeah. So we'll

507
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:26,564
get some follow up on that and see what we are, because it's a great

508
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:30,260
idea. We want to go to our communities

509
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,960
because of staffing. A lot of the storefronts were

510
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,520
closed down. So if we can have a mobile outreach,

511
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,116
I guess I used to call them Winnebagos vehicles,

512
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:48,330
but we can go directly to the community. Right. Just curious about

513
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,604
the status of that. And then secondly, I think my first year in

514
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:56,124
office, I took a tour of the forensic center. I was fascinated by it,

515
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:59,070
just overwhelmed with the amount of work that they do.

516
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,176
If I understand this, this is a decrease in their budget. Is this

517
00:34:04,198 --> 00:34:07,744
the variance? Is that a variance? So for what we

518
00:34:07,782 --> 00:34:11,744
have, it's just the number of individuals that transition over from

519
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:15,804
the city to the forensics. So it's just kind of like a holding

520
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:19,556
pattern because that was what was agreed upon in order to

521
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:23,044
keep them with the benefits of the sure. So then this

522
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:26,736
leads to my question in terms of making sure your officers

523
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:30,184
on the ground are doing yeoman's work around with the homicide rate.

524
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:33,476
Everyone's doing their part. That's the asset.

525
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:37,256
We've asked the community what type of funding would they need in order to

526
00:34:37,278 --> 00:34:41,164
make sure that evidence is not backlog? All of that data collection so

527
00:34:41,202 --> 00:34:44,332
they can keep in track with the goals that we're setting in the city.

528
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:47,640
We have to stay in communication with our forensic

529
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,620
center as we make more arrests.

530
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,848
There is more of a demand on them, and we need to make sure that

531
00:34:55,014 --> 00:34:58,336
we're meeting that demand. So we've been

532
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:02,284
in communication, and I'm sure they're going to be in communication

533
00:35:02,412 --> 00:35:05,648
with the mayor to make sure they get what

534
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:08,996
they need. Sure. Wonderful. So you're not saying we need to play the

535
00:35:09,018 --> 00:35:12,452
mega millions in order to get this funded? Because maybe we need to play some.

536
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:16,760
I think that there should be some direct conversations

537
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,616
on need and we need to work

538
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:24,808
together as a team. And the mayor has been just stand up

539
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:28,408
with that, including the council. When any of us

540
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:32,204
pertaining to safety of our city needs something and we

541
00:35:32,242 --> 00:35:35,916
present it to everybody has been very fair, and I want us

542
00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:38,856
to keep doing that with all, not only HPD,

543
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:42,668
but with all departments in the city. Vice Mayor

544
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:46,208
Pro TEM martha Castex Tatum. Thank you, Chair. Chief Finner, thank you for

545
00:35:46,214 --> 00:35:50,000
the presentation. Ms. Smith, thank you for always being so very thorough.

546
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,700
I wanted to talk a little bit about ShotSpotter.

547
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,008
We had almost a unanimous council vote on the support of ShotSpotter.

548
00:36:01,104 --> 00:36:05,156
Our residents are clamoring for ShotSpotter in

549
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:09,044
our communities. If you can give us some insight

550
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:13,140
on the value of that and if you anticipate that the cost of Shot spotter

551
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,660
will decrease I don't know about decreasing.

552
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,264
We hope as we add more, we can make better deals.

553
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:24,110
But it's a tremendous piece of technology,

554
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,996
gun detection. We've had cases where when

555
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:33,884
they discharge a firearm, we're immediately responding

556
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:37,632
to it and we have made some arrests. So as

557
00:36:37,686 --> 00:36:40,608
many more as we can stand up as fund and allow.

558
00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:43,760
But again, you look at different cities,

559
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,848
it's not just the city government responsibility.

560
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,756
Everybody has to kick in corporations so we

561
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:56,376
can stand up more, but it's something that's needed and wanted by

562
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:59,188
the chief and our men and women in uniform.

563
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:03,770
So it's something I hope we can find more. But also

564
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,936
the corporations and private entities step up and assist

565
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:12,540
us with. That. And then I wanted to talk about

566
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,696
the rollout of the outward facing cameras.

567
00:37:16,888 --> 00:37:20,092
If we can eventually come back to maybe

568
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:23,536
public safety once that 90 day period is

569
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:27,008
up, to talk about those places that have

570
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:29,824
installed those cameras or the ones that have not.

571
00:37:30,022 --> 00:37:33,868
What we need to do to make sure that we are enforcing that ordinance.

572
00:37:33,964 --> 00:37:38,084
One of the biggest complaints we have in our district is the

573
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:42,288
nuisance that is created at a lot of those convenience stores.

574
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:45,776
And when you let that petty crime go on, it leads to bigger

575
00:37:45,808 --> 00:37:50,276
crime. So I think we are headed in the right direction with those ordinances.

576
00:37:50,388 --> 00:37:54,088
And we appreciate all that you and your entire

577
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:57,396
team is doing to keep us all safe in the city of Houston. Thank you.

578
00:37:57,438 --> 00:38:01,304
Council Member we're very intentional on holding those convenience

579
00:38:01,352 --> 00:38:03,404
stores, bars, and anybody, any,

580
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:07,580
established accountable for helping us fight crime.

581
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,760
Council member. Leticia plummer. Thank you so much. Mayor Person.

582
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,512
Thank you, Chief. Good morning. Good morning. Two questions.

583
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:19,120
What is the retention rate of our cadets?

584
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,750
Do they stay with the force? Have we found that?

585
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,508
You know, I had some let me see

586
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,580
if I had some numbers. When did they graduate?

587
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,610
I forgot where I was on my page. I looked at it.

588
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,636
Be specific. When they graduate. Yes. Let me get

589
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:52,096
you a percentage. I know we have it somewhere here, but we'll

590
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:55,016
get that to you. Absolutely. Okay, wonderful. Thank you. I would like to know that

591
00:38:55,038 --> 00:38:58,216
you're looking at graduation rate. How long? Stay on

592
00:38:58,238 --> 00:39:02,548
the course. Okay, I got you. What's the retention rate of our graduates?

593
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:06,364
Because we're paying for them to be trained. Right. Got you. Okay. And then what

594
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:09,804
would that look like in terms of increasing that number, whatever that is?

595
00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:13,884
We can talk offline on that. The other question is, you mentioned the

596
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:17,070
Biden administration. Congratulations on meeting with the President.

597
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,588
Thank you. Just honestly, I hear that we

598
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:24,248
can put thousands of officers on the ground, but if we don't get forensics funded

599
00:39:24,344 --> 00:39:27,808
properly, it leads to two issues. Right. The backlog

600
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,208
is going to continue to increase, and then people are going to be falsely accused

601
00:39:30,224 --> 00:39:33,316
for issues. Yes. So my question to you is maybe this is a not right

602
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:36,784
now question, but I would love to see our forensics department

603
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,904
get the money that they need. I think they need I think they're short,

604
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:42,436
like, $9 million to fill that, to get that backlog

605
00:39:42,468 --> 00:39:47,896
handled. And also training

606
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:51,284
and funding going toward

607
00:39:51,332 --> 00:39:53,964
our officers that collect the data,

608
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:58,716
specimens, et cetera, on the ground so

609
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:02,076
we can make sure whatever is collected is collected properly. Yes. And our

610
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:05,695
officers are going to need training and all that they need to do

611
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,456
to that do that well. So those are two things I would love to see

612
00:40:09,478 --> 00:40:13,072
line items for. Yes. Okay.

613
00:40:13,126 --> 00:40:16,876
Thank you. Council Member Carolyn Evan Shabaz.

614
00:40:17,068 --> 00:40:20,228
Thank you, Mayor Pro tim and I believe last year,

615
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:23,748
council Member Pollard gave 50,000,

616
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:27,364
I think, to the forensics unit. And I would like to,

617
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:30,952
like they say, follow that cab. I'd like to do that as well

618
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:34,916
from my council district service funds. And I urge other council

619
00:40:34,948 --> 00:40:38,628
members to look at that as well, because we're

620
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:42,344
going to have to get these cases, get the information

621
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:46,012
that is given to us examined in order to move

622
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:50,044
through the court system. And so I would like to say

623
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:53,372
that and challenge my colleagues to do the same.

624
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:57,276
Thank you. Council member Tasha

625
00:40:57,308 --> 00:41:00,384
Jackson. Thank you.

626
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:03,952
Hey, Chief. How are you? Good morning, Council. So I have three

627
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:07,252
questions. So what is HBB's clearance rate for

628
00:41:07,306 --> 00:41:10,468
violent crime last year? And what is the

629
00:41:10,474 --> 00:41:14,340
clearance rate for crime overall? And then lastly,

630
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,176
constituents have reached out about the cadet classes

631
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:22,660
and just want to know what is HBD doing to recruits

632
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,044
from within the neighborhoods? There's a complaint

633
00:41:27,092 --> 00:41:31,076
that concern that the officers that's patrolling

634
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:34,296
the neighborhoods do not reflect the

635
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,236
race, the people that they're so they want to see more black officers in

636
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:41,692
the district. What are we doing to recruit the

637
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:45,592
black officer? Let me start with the clearance rates.

638
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:49,008
I went over the homicide. I'll have to get back with you, and we'll get

639
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:52,960
some time in the day. On the other clearance rates for

640
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:58,716
violent crimes. In terms of pacifically

641
00:41:58,828 --> 00:42:02,276
African American officers, the first thing I want to

642
00:42:02,298 --> 00:42:05,556
do is make sure that we're recruiting good officers. I want to look

643
00:42:05,578 --> 00:42:09,140
at that heart. But I understand when you have

644
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,904
officers from the community who are committed, who knows the

645
00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:16,664
community, it helps. So we are doing

646
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:20,196
everything we can to increase the diversity

647
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:24,156
in our agency. But I also do

648
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:27,416
not, and I say this with a lot of respect,

649
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:31,720
I don't ever want to discount the contributions

650
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,324
of non minority officers with our

651
00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:38,896
agency. And I know that you're not accident or saying that, but I

652
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:42,880
want to acknowledge their work because they have been in our communities doing

653
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,632
all much work for 25,

654
00:42:45,686 --> 00:42:49,428
35 years without any complaints and

655
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:53,044
retired honorably. So I do want to acknowledge that.

656
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:57,808
But at the same time, what are we doing to increase minorities?

657
00:42:57,984 --> 00:43:01,524
We're going out to where they are, the universities.

658
00:43:01,652 --> 00:43:04,488
Let me stop. Keep going. Okay,

659
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:07,700
universities. Some of the radio stations,

660
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,560
hip hop radio stations,

661
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,364
wherever they are, we instituted not

662
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:20,444
the word study, but the

663
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:24,510
life program. What is it, life history,

664
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,464
where you get an individual and I'll get this

665
00:43:28,502 --> 00:43:31,968
quick example. We had at first,

666
00:43:32,054 --> 00:43:35,756
you had to have so many college hours or you had to be honorably discharged

667
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:39,044
from the military. What about the young man and young lady that worked

668
00:43:39,082 --> 00:43:43,108
at Ups or any other job for five years and is a great

669
00:43:43,194 --> 00:43:46,788
individual? And we say in our agency, well,

670
00:43:46,954 --> 00:43:49,908
you don't have a college, you don't have a military, we don't want you.

671
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:53,064
We did away with that. Okay? So we're looking at other

672
00:43:53,102 --> 00:43:57,256
ways that we can recruit not only minorities, but anybody

673
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:00,936
to increase that pool. And we'll continue to do that. But I

674
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:04,424
need help from council members and everybody else in our

675
00:44:04,462 --> 00:44:07,928
community. It's just not the job of the police department.

676
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:10,860
I need you all to advocate for us, and I know you all do,

677
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,572
but all citizens. It is a great career, and I know

678
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:17,776
people don't think that sometimes because they listen to

679
00:44:17,798 --> 00:44:20,876
the negative, but this is an honorable profession, and we'll

680
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,330
continue to do whatever we can increase those numbers.

681
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,040
All right, so before we go to

682
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,756
second round of questions from council members, I have a couple of questions,

683
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:33,316
and it's related to some of the comments you made,

684
00:44:33,418 --> 00:44:37,044
specifically backlog and more demand on the

685
00:44:37,162 --> 00:44:39,190
Houston Forensic Science Center.

686
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,644
Over the past couple of years, we've become very aware of a significant

687
00:44:44,692 --> 00:44:48,296
backlog in forensic lab testing, mostly due to

688
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,300
COVID, mostly due to a halt in court operations,

689
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,636
increase in homicides. We have job openings that

690
00:44:56,658 --> 00:45:00,604
we can't fill. What can we do? Because it

691
00:45:00,642 --> 00:45:04,684
seems as though the testing that we're doing today won't be available

692
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:08,396
for three years. So to council Member Plummer's point and to council member

693
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:11,632
Evan Shabbaz's point, if we arrest someone today

694
00:45:11,686 --> 00:45:14,400
for a homicide or whatever, do some testing,

695
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,012
it's not for three years that this person actually goes

696
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:23,284
to court. Thus we're seeing a lot of bad

697
00:45:23,322 --> 00:45:26,868
people going back on the streets. So when people talk about

698
00:45:27,034 --> 00:45:31,256
violence, I will point to the

699
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:35,080
courts, the judicial system in the city of Houston and Harris County,

700
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,204
but we also have to look at the Houston Forensics Science

701
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:42,904
Lab. So what can we do to

702
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:46,344
make sure that we get these bad guys to trial quicker

703
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:49,740
with forensic evidence and get them off the streets?

704
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,096
Merrick pro TEM. I don't want to speak for them, but whatever we

705
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:58,064
do, we need to make sure that we're working together to

706
00:45:58,102 --> 00:46:01,804
make sure that there's properly staffing

707
00:46:01,852 --> 00:46:05,500
and funding of that. I don't know all the operations

708
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,644
over there, but just as we

709
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:12,116
support the police officers, we got to support all the

710
00:46:12,138 --> 00:46:15,348
departments, and they need some help over there.

711
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:19,364
And again, I think the mayor, when it's bought to

712
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:23,016
him and laid out, he's going to make the

713
00:46:23,038 --> 00:46:27,016
right decision, and I'm sure that city council will support it.

714
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:31,210
So as a non police guy, I'm going to draw a parallel between

715
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,324
forensic testing backlog and number of

716
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:39,068
criminals that are on the streets. So until we get

717
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:42,876
part a solved, we're going to constantly see more bad guys on

718
00:46:42,898 --> 00:46:46,248
the streets. So I'll point to something. We gave you a

719
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:49,324
million dollars in ARPA funds for buyback guns.

720
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:52,736
Has that program been successful? How many guns have we

721
00:46:52,758 --> 00:46:56,236
bought back? And specifically, how many dollars have we spent on that

722
00:46:56,278 --> 00:46:59,956
buyback program? We're still standing it up. It was

723
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:04,016
a lot dealing with it. You know, right now we're

724
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:08,150
running all of our guns through the knob and system.

725
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,596
So I want to do that. But in a gun

726
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:16,276
buyback program, you can't get any identification

727
00:47:16,388 --> 00:47:19,656
from the people. What I understand, but I still want to

728
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:22,712
run those guns, so it's a bit

729
00:47:22,766 --> 00:47:26,396
complicated, and I got

730
00:47:26,498 --> 00:47:30,088
ms. Cloud is not here with our community affairs.

731
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:34,740
She's coordinating that with us. But we'll

732
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,400
do whatever we can with that. Okay. Thank you, council Member Abby Cayman.

733
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,752
Thank you, Chief. I ask every

734
00:47:42,806 --> 00:47:46,532
department this, and I know that in the appendix, you have a list

735
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:49,844
here. HPD is

736
00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:54,244
doing an extraordinary job with very

737
00:47:54,282 --> 00:47:57,840
tough circumstances. The unmet needs of the department.

738
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,230
I'd like you to share a little bit about that.

739
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,424
Again, we have a certain amount in the budget. There are

740
00:48:04,462 --> 00:48:08,056
constraints. What are the needs? I'm looking at

741
00:48:08,078 --> 00:48:12,072
this list. A lot of it has to do with technology and

742
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:15,384
not in the list. I talk about it all the time. I'm like the broken

743
00:48:15,432 --> 00:48:19,340
record about it. But CAD. RMS relies on CAD.

744
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,836
Real time crime center has to do with CAD. So all

745
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:27,360
of these can you talk about those costs, any additional needs,

746
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,944
including facility needs for

747
00:48:30,982 --> 00:48:34,816
our divisions? Because those buildings are like the

748
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:38,288
rest of the city right now in terms of struggling. We're in a city of

749
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:42,468
a huge city. You look at our square miles. The first

750
00:48:42,554 --> 00:48:45,680
need, we have an aging fleet.

751
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,028
If we get anything additional or extra

752
00:48:49,114 --> 00:48:52,712
money, almost 50% of our

753
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:56,424
fleet is past the lifespan, and that's 100,005 years

754
00:48:56,462 --> 00:49:00,072
for marked 120,000 miles and

755
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:03,816
seven years for unmarked. Almost 50% of our vehicles

756
00:49:03,848 --> 00:49:07,804
are over. I was at the gas pumps before

757
00:49:07,842 --> 00:49:11,896
I went to DC. And there was a young female officer,

758
00:49:12,008 --> 00:49:15,356
and I had to apologize to her, and she drove up in that car

759
00:49:15,378 --> 00:49:18,816
to put gas in there. I know we're doing the best that

760
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,784
we can do, but we have to do better. As far as

761
00:49:22,822 --> 00:49:27,700
a real time crime center, we do have through

762
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:31,380
the Tag Center, they have pledged to

763
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,124
fund some of the additions we need to

764
00:49:35,162 --> 00:49:38,310
make it a true real time crime center.

765
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:43,124
We're still waiting for that money to come down. Hopefully they'll

766
00:49:43,172 --> 00:49:46,250
prove it and we'll move forward on that.

767
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,450
But I would say, number one, the need

768
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,484
for better vehicles and newer vehicles, that is

769
00:49:55,522 --> 00:49:59,356
a must. We're not in a city that's very small

770
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:03,244
and you can do a lot of foot patrol. Even though I would love I

771
00:50:03,282 --> 00:50:06,956
love foot patrol. I love neighborhood policing. But the fact of the

772
00:50:06,978 --> 00:50:11,024
matter is, you move around in vehicles in Houston, and we need

773
00:50:11,062 --> 00:50:13,536
to keep up with these criminals. And the only way we're going to be able

774
00:50:13,558 --> 00:50:17,236
to do that is put money and funds as much as we can

775
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:20,644
into the fleet and really

776
00:50:20,682 --> 00:50:24,884
quickly. In addition to Vice Mayor pro TEM's request on follow up

777
00:50:25,002 --> 00:50:28,436
on the new camera ordinance, I'd love to get

778
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:32,324
an update from you all on the ATF partnership. We keep

779
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,716
talking about violent crime, but it's guns.

780
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:38,952
Yes, it is. We'll get it. Thank you.

781
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:42,488
Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you, Chair.

782
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:46,220
There was about a million for increase in

783
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:49,692
temporary personnel services in the Chiefs command. Is that for

784
00:50:49,826 --> 00:50:53,576
a specific project or ePROs? ePROs.

785
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:57,104
That's what the okay, got it.

786
00:50:57,142 --> 00:51:00,048
And then I just want to point out and you noticed you had it in

787
00:51:00,054 --> 00:51:04,284
the adjustments. This was a $2 million over budgeting

788
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:08,100
of health benefits. That comes back to the department.

789
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,104
Correct. Like last year, there was no so it was originally

790
00:51:13,152 --> 00:51:16,720
anticipated that there would be more staffing

791
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,148
and that would actually adjust for

792
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:23,464
the health benefits. And so the health benefits was

793
00:51:23,502 --> 00:51:27,480
reduced by the finance. Got it. One more thing. And on recruiting,

794
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,352
I like the changes you made, the Ups example and all. And also,

795
00:51:31,406 --> 00:51:34,744
you guys spent over a million dollars, which is a really good thing. On tuition

796
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:37,870
reimbursement, that should be another big recruiting thing.

797
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,004
Any kind of incentive. I really want us to look at that as

798
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:45,730
a team. It's really important.

799
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,960
But even front end incentives.

800
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:54,640
At the meeting in DC, you asked about a councilwoman.

801
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,408
That's what I think has been working for other agencies,

802
00:51:58,444 --> 00:52:01,812
and it may work for us, but also to

803
00:52:01,946 --> 00:52:06,372
help with some of the debt. Now, the challenge is when

804
00:52:06,506 --> 00:52:09,844
individuals come in and we give them front end incentives and

805
00:52:09,882 --> 00:52:13,544
they leave, and we can say, well, hey, we require you to

806
00:52:13,582 --> 00:52:17,176
stay three years or five years, but when they leave, who's collecting the

807
00:52:17,198 --> 00:52:20,456
money? So then that's the challenge that some

808
00:52:20,478 --> 00:52:24,270
of the other chiefs had as well. So just want to bring that up

809
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,588
so we have no other council members in queue. I'll ask the last questions.

810
00:52:30,674 --> 00:52:34,072
It really upsets me when I turn on the media and I hear comments

811
00:52:34,136 --> 00:52:38,380
like the murder capital of the world, and then your comment about homicides

812
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:42,236
moving from 70% to 70. I had some visitors in town

813
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:46,184
from my hometown of New Orleans, and they were talking about crime,

814
00:52:46,252 --> 00:52:50,020
murder rates, things like that. And my explanation was

815
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,944
we have a significant problem with domestic

816
00:52:54,992 --> 00:52:58,228
violence. The other day I read a report where

817
00:52:58,314 --> 00:53:01,796
a lady approached a man with a gun. Man took it from her and shot

818
00:53:01,828 --> 00:53:05,400
her. I don't know anyone in the world

819
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:09,204
who can stop something like that. Whether you have a police force

820
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,890
with 2 million people or a police force with one,

821
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,456
it seems to me like domestic violence shootings,

822
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,172
and I'll call them homicides, are happening each and every day.

823
00:53:20,226 --> 00:53:23,788
So I think I understand your statistics on 70 to seven,

824
00:53:23,874 --> 00:53:27,528
because every time I look at the TV, the murders

825
00:53:27,544 --> 00:53:31,404
are related to domestic violence. So can you lend a little

826
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:34,796
color to that? As far as the homicide rate? Domestic violence has

827
00:53:34,818 --> 00:53:38,788
ever anything we can domestic violence is one

828
00:53:38,874 --> 00:53:42,516
category that's driving our homicide up. But there

829
00:53:42,538 --> 00:53:47,380
has to be education. There has to be intervention and intervention

830
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,224
into it. And what I mean by that, we have to make

831
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:54,648
sure with our Dart program and I'm so proud of

832
00:53:54,654 --> 00:53:58,072
that when we have an advocate in the car

833
00:53:58,126 --> 00:54:01,296
with the police officer, once you go to that scene

834
00:54:01,348 --> 00:54:04,200
and somebody is assaulted, they still alive.

835
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,124
It's a vicious cycle that's going to get worse. If we can

836
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:11,704
lend in what we do, those resources

837
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:15,328
to that victim or that complainant right away,

838
00:54:15,414 --> 00:54:18,050
get them out of that situation,

839
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,592
that's the way that we save lives.

840
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:26,640
But it is frustrating to police officers when we're judged.

841
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,040
I don't know how you can prevent it when it's behind walls,

842
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,676
but we can't forget about them. We have to

843
00:54:34,698 --> 00:54:38,416
do everything we can as a society to make sure that we're addressing

844
00:54:38,448 --> 00:54:41,960
it. And we are, but it is frustrating. It's also frustrating

845
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,356
when people turn and they push

846
00:54:46,388 --> 00:54:49,992
their own narrative. What's the narrative now? How many

847
00:54:50,046 --> 00:54:54,004
people you talk and you hear talking about the dramatic

848
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:57,756
drop in homicide rate? Okay, now we

849
00:54:57,778 --> 00:55:01,356
know summer is here and we know what to expect during the

850
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:05,016
summer. But we're rolling up and we're going to meet the challenge. And I don't

851
00:55:05,048 --> 00:55:08,716
take all the credit for homicides. I said we have some good investigators

852
00:55:08,748 --> 00:55:12,480
and good police work, but it is truly something that

853
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,064
this community and everybody has to partner up with us to

854
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:19,876
make the city safer. But we're on the right track. And I

855
00:55:19,898 --> 00:55:23,620
thank you all again for all your support. Thank you. Council member Abby Cayman,

856
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,804
I appreciate that you brought up domestic violence in chief. I'm going to assume that

857
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:32,840
the over $4 million in ARPA funds that are going towards

858
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:36,664
Dart, dart forensic nurses is helping. And again,

859
00:55:36,702 --> 00:55:40,436
hats off to Dart. Some of the most dangerous situations

860
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:44,428
that they're responding to. But mayor pro TEM to your point in

861
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:48,296
terms of preventative action, again, the majority of domestic violence

862
00:55:48,328 --> 00:55:51,784
homicides are with a firearm and we have no red flag

863
00:55:51,832 --> 00:55:55,488
laws the courts aren't able even to enforce right now. So if

864
00:55:55,494 --> 00:55:58,784
there's a record of someone perpetrating or is

865
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:02,316
a domestic abuser, I'm assuming, chief,

866
00:56:02,348 --> 00:56:04,690
you all can't remove those firearms from that situation.

867
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,284
Yeah, we still can move when

868
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:13,476
there's evidence of violence, you can temporarily move those firearms and

869
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,756
we do do it, but I don't dab into the

870
00:56:16,778 --> 00:56:21,604
politics too much. But I do want to say this lawmakers,

871
00:56:21,732 --> 00:56:25,396
and we talked about this in DC. Around the nation, I don't care if you're

872
00:56:25,428 --> 00:56:28,360
local, you state or you're federal,

873
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,912
everybody needs to be real careful as we move

874
00:56:31,966 --> 00:56:35,644
through the pandemic and violent crimes. Be careful what you

875
00:56:35,682 --> 00:56:39,576
vote for, be careful what you write in law, okay? When there's

876
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:42,796
a backlog, we need to do the

877
00:56:42,818 --> 00:56:46,304
best that we can do and not point fingers at

878
00:56:46,342 --> 00:56:50,096
reducing the guns on the street, especially in the wrong hands

879
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,804
of individuals who commit violence after violence.

880
00:56:53,932 --> 00:56:57,424
Now everybody's smart in here and we read through the lines,

881
00:56:57,472 --> 00:56:59,590
but everybody needs to do their part.

882
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,956
I just encourage friends and

883
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:07,940
family and anybody. We need to do our part and be smart about

884
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:10,250
gun violence. We really do.

885
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:15,256
Council member Tiffany Thomas. Thank you. Mayor Pro tim

886
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:19,016
raised a really good point about the domestic violence, but I can't help to

887
00:57:19,038 --> 00:57:23,320
think about active shooter issues happening,

888
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:26,476
and I know there was some in north Harris County. Buffalo is

889
00:57:26,498 --> 00:57:29,756
the latest one. And so the investment in

890
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:33,336
domestic violence is significant. But when we're talking about active shooter

891
00:57:33,368 --> 00:57:36,964
and making sure your division is ready because I have to have conversations

892
00:57:37,032 --> 00:57:40,764
with my father about going to grocery stores right, and transitioning

893
00:57:40,812 --> 00:57:44,944
that because of what could possibly be. We're a huge city and I don't see

894
00:57:44,982 --> 00:57:48,692
that in terms of your division around active shooter and that training.

895
00:57:48,746 --> 00:57:52,404
But do you need additional resources for your men and women in order

896
00:57:52,442 --> 00:57:54,900
to always use additional resources?

897
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,736
Sure. Active shooting, anything else? But Councilwoman, you bring

898
00:57:58,778 --> 00:58:02,824
up a valid point. We do need the world that we're living in

899
00:58:02,862 --> 00:58:06,600
today. We all need to be ready for whatever comes.

900
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:11,176
And an active shooting is a problem, and I

901
00:58:11,198 --> 00:58:14,584
hope I'm wrong, but I think it's going to get worse before it gets

902
00:58:14,622 --> 00:58:18,270
better. And we all have to look out for one another to the public.

903
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,008
Be aware of your surroundings. I want us to keep going where we're

904
00:58:22,024 --> 00:58:25,532
going and take care of one another, but be aware of your surroundings.

905
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:28,848
We'll continue with our active shooting training that

906
00:58:29,014 --> 00:58:32,812
Steven Daniels does and some other individuals,

907
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:35,936
and we need to increase that because you have to be

908
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:39,510
in a mindset and if you don't think about it before it happens,

909
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,796
you're going to freeze. So we got to get in the mindset and we

910
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:47,796
have to train our officers to respond quickly and effectively. But also

911
00:58:47,898 --> 00:58:51,272
citizens need to know what to do. The first

912
00:58:51,326 --> 00:58:54,820
few seconds of an active shooter,

913
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,184
the first few minutes, if you can survive that,

914
00:58:58,222 --> 00:59:01,516
if you can do the right thing and wait for

915
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:05,212
the police arrive, once we arrive, we handle it pretty

916
00:59:05,266 --> 00:59:08,940
quickly. So we all need to, as a community, be aware of it

917
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,350
and train up.

918
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,496
Vice mayor pro TEM martha kestex tatum. Thank you,

919
00:59:16,518 --> 00:59:20,176
chair. I really wanted to just amplify some

920
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:24,416
of the performance measures that

921
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:28,944
you have in your book and the external

922
00:59:28,992 --> 00:59:33,040
citizen complaints with the expected

923
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,270
performance measures of a reduction of 2%.

924
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,524
I like the trend in that

925
00:59:41,642 --> 00:59:45,016
specific category, especially because now we

926
00:59:45,038 --> 00:59:48,596
have more ways for people to report their complaints.

927
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:52,796
And the fact that we have opened that up with

928
00:59:52,818 --> 00:59:56,972
the addition of Ms. Okafor's office and the other

929
00:59:57,026 --> 01:00:01,160
opportunities that people have to actually express their concerns

930
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,120
and that we're trending downward, I think it speaks volumes for

931
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:08,848
our city and for our police department. And then

932
01:00:08,934 --> 01:00:12,780
on the accomplishments that we completed,

933
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,176
78 of 104 of the

934
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:19,712
mayor's task Force on Policing Reform recommendations.

935
01:00:19,856 --> 01:00:23,636
I don't think we tout that enough. When that was happening,

936
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:27,108
we had residents in the city of Houston asking

937
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:32,168
for these items and we completed 78 of 104

938
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:36,116
of those recommendations. And as a city and a police

939
01:00:36,148 --> 01:00:40,244
department, I think this speaks volumes for our residents

940
01:00:40,292 --> 01:00:43,896
to know that we hear them and we want to make sure that we

941
01:00:43,918 --> 01:00:46,904
are serving them to the best of our capabilities.

942
01:00:47,032 --> 01:00:50,856
And so I wanted to say thank you to all of our HPD officers

943
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:53,976
and everyone that served on that task force, to the council

944
01:00:54,008 --> 01:00:58,108
members and to the entire city of Houston, because public safety

945
01:00:58,204 --> 01:01:01,920
is one of the most important things that will take place in our city.

946
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:05,600
And I think we are leading the nation, hence your

947
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,276
visit to the White House and setting

948
01:01:09,308 --> 01:01:12,564
a real standard as we deal with tough issues in

949
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:15,828
this country. Thank you so much for bringing that up. That was in the talking

950
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:19,556
points and I was trying to save time, but I'm so proud

951
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:22,410
of that and we are all proud of that.

952
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,770
I want to say this too, right quick, if I can.

953
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,520
When I was up in DC.

954
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:34,060
President Biden's administration. Several members spoke of

955
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:37,708
our one Safe Houston plan. They said that it was one of the

956
01:01:37,714 --> 01:01:41,256
best that they have seen because we're actually bringing people together and fighting

957
01:01:41,288 --> 01:01:45,196
crime, violence, disruption programs,

958
01:01:45,308 --> 01:01:48,080
dealing with mental illness, more funding for that,

959
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,888
working with domestic violence. But they were very excited about

960
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:56,050
the way that we are bringing people together, building trust,

961
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,784
working on issues that are symptoms

962
01:02:00,912 --> 01:02:04,496
of violent crime. I'm really proud

963
01:02:04,528 --> 01:02:07,860
and excited about it. And it's not a police thing, it's a community

964
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,556
thing. And that's huge here. And it starts with

965
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:15,976
council, it starts with our great mayor. And I

966
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:19,416
was very proud and I am proud about it. Thanks for allowing me to say

967
01:02:19,438 --> 01:02:23,224
that. Thank you, Chief. And we have a number of public speakers that are

968
01:02:23,262 --> 01:02:26,604
going to come before us in a minute. But before we let you go

969
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:30,216
back to the streets, I applaud

970
01:02:30,248 --> 01:02:34,108
your decision. I'm not sure if who made it on the administrative team,

971
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:37,696
but to go from six cadet classes to five, but to staff them

972
01:02:37,718 --> 01:02:41,084
with more individuals, to get them on the streets more rapidly,

973
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,210
I think that was a brilliant move and I'm glad to support it.

974
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,984
In the day of defunding police, I'm proud to say that

975
01:02:48,022 --> 01:02:51,364
we add money to your budget, but we can reallocate the amount of money

976
01:02:51,402 --> 01:02:55,184
in there to certain departments, like you mentioned, with the mental health component.

977
01:02:55,312 --> 01:02:58,832
So a lot of those things that we're doing today are very creative

978
01:02:58,896 --> 01:03:01,992
and I applaud you and your staff for doing those types of things.

979
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:05,956
The one thing that always bothers me, and this is my 9th

980
01:03:06,068 --> 01:03:09,512
Police Department budget process, I always ask

981
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:12,868
this question, how many of your police officers

982
01:03:12,884 --> 01:03:15,950
are retirement eligible today?

983
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,684
Percentage wise? Just a guess. About 27%?

984
01:03:20,802 --> 01:03:24,536
27%. I look behind you and I see some great individuals

985
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:28,016
and I walk the streets every day. And you

986
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:31,024
all do a phenomenal job. I know I couldn't do it,

987
01:03:31,062 --> 01:03:34,144
so God bless. Thank you for what you do.

988
01:03:34,262 --> 01:03:37,664
Stay safe. And as I always say,

989
01:03:37,702 --> 01:03:40,768
whenever I say I'm the last guy, it comes back to somebody else. So council

990
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:44,912
member Robert Guy egos. I'll give you the last word. Thank you, Mayor Protein.

991
01:03:45,056 --> 01:03:48,516
Thank you, Chief, for the presentation. In regards to

992
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:52,644
the budget, in regards to recruiting, does HPD

993
01:03:52,692 --> 01:03:56,008
reach out to the High School of Law Enforcement working

994
01:03:56,094 --> 01:03:59,172
some kind of I know, like you stated, that right now you're

995
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:02,856
required some college degree or some college credits. Yes,

996
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:06,316
and what have you. So are you all partnering with

997
01:04:06,338 --> 01:04:09,448
the High School of Law Enforcement? Not only that high school, other high schools.

998
01:04:09,464 --> 01:04:13,148
With our youth programs. I forgot to mention that I'm

999
01:04:13,234 --> 01:04:16,850
glad you brought up youth programs and I'm stepping outside,

1000
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,784
but it's very important youth and going into this

1001
01:04:20,822 --> 01:04:24,000
summer, please, whatever we do with Parks and Rec,

1002
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:27,852
get those pools open, hire more lifeguards

1003
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:31,364
and get some basketball goes up. So we have to do that.

1004
01:04:31,402 --> 01:04:34,516
To answer your question, absolutely. And that's a part of

1005
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:38,724
our recruiting. With our Explorer program, we start working with those young

1006
01:04:38,762 --> 01:04:41,912
men and young women at a young age,

1007
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:45,912
as early as the 9th grade, getting them acclimated and

1008
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:49,768
hoping that they join our agency later. Well,

1009
01:04:49,934 --> 01:04:54,060
that's good to know. And I appreciate also

1010
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:57,900
you mentioning regarding keeping

1011
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,676
or us being aware of what's out there in regards to I

1012
01:05:03,698 --> 01:05:07,740
know what happened this past weekend in Buffalo and what happened in El Paso

1013
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,504
a couple of years ago. I know that

1014
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:15,008
we received calls from constituents. A couple of weeks ago,

1015
01:05:15,174 --> 01:05:18,956
there was a neo Nazi group that was putting baggies out in people's

1016
01:05:18,988 --> 01:05:23,120
driveways promoting neo Nazism.

1017
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,660
And of course, we asked them to call HPD.

1018
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,244
So I don't know if that's are you getting other calls

1019
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:34,516
throughout the city as well? We take those hate

1020
01:05:34,548 --> 01:05:37,540
crimes and crimes of bias really seriously.

1021
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:41,044
I hadn't seen the uptick, but I'll get you some stats

1022
01:05:41,092 --> 01:05:44,940
just to make sure. But it's a call to our entire community

1023
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:49,020
to look after one another, and we really need to stamp out that hate

1024
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,564
at the earliest moment. We can just stop

1025
01:05:53,602 --> 01:05:57,440
it and stamp it out. And there's some responsibility to close

1026
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:01,296
friends and family members as well. When you see it, get your

1027
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:02,610
loved ones some help.

1028
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,900
Great. Thank you. Once again, thank you for what

1029
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:12,896
you do each and every day. Thank you to my friends in HPOU

1030
01:06:13,008 --> 01:06:16,832
and as I heard two weeks ago, officers dismissed.

1031
01:06:16,976 --> 01:06:20,612
We'll now go to public speakers. Mayor Pro. Tim,

1032
01:06:20,746 --> 01:06:24,532
before we leave, I wanted to just reiterate that for the gun buyback

1033
01:06:24,596 --> 01:06:28,152
program, it's actually starting July 30, so I think that one

1034
01:06:28,206 --> 01:06:31,572
was just determined this morning. So I wanted to. Okay, so it doesn't

1035
01:06:31,636 --> 01:06:34,796
start until July. July. July. Got it.

1036
01:06:34,898 --> 01:06:36,620
Thanks. God bless.

1037
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,180
First public speaker is Fabiola Jimenez.

1038
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,260
Fabiola Jimenez. Going once, going twice.

1039
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,180
Mr. Jason. Oliver.

1040
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,856
Thank have handouts

1041
01:07:01,888 --> 01:07:02,470
today.

1042
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,800
Sorry, I wasn't trying to put you to work, Councilmember Jackson. I wasn't expecting everybody

1043
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:24,800
to run out during public comment.

1044
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,416
And we're going to hold everybody to 1 minute, as instructions stated,

1045
01:07:30,448 --> 01:07:33,268
because we have a meeting that starts in just a little while and we have

1046
01:07:33,274 --> 01:07:36,992
to transition. All right, I'll go quick. So this handout

1047
01:07:37,056 --> 01:07:40,928
shows items that are consistently higher in general fund spending than actuals

1048
01:07:40,944 --> 01:07:44,184
and therefore good candidates free allocation to a department like

1049
01:07:44,222 --> 01:07:48,116
housing. I know council member Catholic Tatum is gone, but she mentioned the complaint

1050
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:51,784
process. If you go on HPD's website right now, please tell

1051
01:07:51,822 --> 01:07:55,576
me if you see an easier process for filing a complaint. It hasn't changed

1052
01:07:55,608 --> 01:07:59,084
on their website. It still asks for your Social Security number in a city like

1053
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:02,536
Houston. According to HPD stats and public safety

1054
01:08:02,568 --> 01:08:06,064
presentations, violent crime and crime overall was down year to date

1055
01:08:06,102 --> 01:08:09,852
before one Safe Houston was announced. I'm concerned that the public is being misled

1056
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:13,756
about things like that. Also, according to the Texas Sandra

1057
01:08:13,788 --> 01:08:17,068
Bland Act racial profiling data for 2021,

1058
01:08:17,174 --> 01:08:20,304
HPD is a state leader in violent traffic stops.

1059
01:08:20,432 --> 01:08:24,884
We have only 3% of stops in Texas, but 44%

1060
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:28,416
of violent stops statewide. That averages out to five violent

1061
01:08:28,448 --> 01:08:31,832
stops per day, with three of them targeting black people each

1062
01:08:31,886 --> 01:08:35,816
day. With these terrible statistics and the clear danger posed both

1063
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:39,236
to officers and residents by these hundreds of thousands

1064
01:08:39,268 --> 01:08:42,940
of stops, how much are we paying for this traffic enforcement?

1065
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,716
Thank you. And I'm assuming this is referring to what

1066
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:49,452
I would call a sort of a surplus. Look ahead.

1067
01:08:49,586 --> 01:08:53,116
Exactly. Okay. Every year, you'll notice within the

1068
01:08:53,218 --> 01:08:57,010
Mo for monthly financial reports, when we get to the end of the year,

1069
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,896
we have a large differential between what we gave

1070
01:09:00,998 --> 01:09:04,896
departments and what they've actually spent. All that money rolls into our

1071
01:09:04,918 --> 01:09:08,116
fund balance. That's why we maintain a healthy fund balance. This year,

1072
01:09:08,138 --> 01:09:11,508
it's projected to be 13 five based on exactly

1073
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:15,536
this information that you gave us. So when the departments

1074
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,364
don't spend the money that's been allocated by council, it rolls into fund

1075
01:09:19,402 --> 01:09:23,508
balance, and we're at 13.5%, and the obligated

1076
01:09:23,604 --> 01:09:27,624
fund balance is 7.5%. So we're doubling that for the rainy day.

1077
01:09:27,742 --> 01:09:31,492
But we want departments to spend that money. Right. So if we reallocate

1078
01:09:31,636 --> 01:09:34,856
these overages, right? Correct. We get hundreds of thousands,

1079
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:38,744
but millions of dollars. Right. Then we get to use those monies for buyback

1080
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:42,636
programs or forensic we heard the problem with forensic science lab. Maybe we

1081
01:09:42,658 --> 01:09:46,428
use some of that for parks

1082
01:09:46,524 --> 01:09:50,256
or parks, whatever. You're exactly right. Right. So I just want to

1083
01:09:50,278 --> 01:09:53,616
say that these are clear candidates for hundreds of thousands of

1084
01:09:53,638 --> 01:09:57,824
dollars of potential reallocation from years of consistent over budgeting

1085
01:09:57,872 --> 01:10:01,296
for these items. Council. Member Alcorn, some of the drainage

1086
01:10:01,328 --> 01:10:04,310
improvements that we talked about in District B. Absolutely.

1087
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,980
District e. Stop. A blanding.

1088
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,656
Thank you. Question comes from a robin. Sorry, I'm back in. Okay. I just

1089
01:10:13,678 --> 01:10:17,428
wanted to point out, I did ask I did notice that $1.4 million increase

1090
01:10:17,444 --> 01:10:21,476
in temporary personnel services, that is for hiring the retired officers.

1091
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:24,764
So that looks like your biggest item on there. I think these

1092
01:10:24,802 --> 01:10:28,524
are adjustments from where we end up and where we're budgeting next

1093
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:32,108
year, correct? Yes, sir. Ma'am. Thank you. Thank you.

1094
01:10:32,114 --> 01:10:35,164
Mr. Oliver saba blandy did

1095
01:10:35,202 --> 01:10:38,988
bring your daughter today. Listener I know she had tar testing.

1096
01:10:39,084 --> 01:10:42,464
How many people with a documented history of mental health challenges did

1097
01:10:42,502 --> 01:10:46,188
HPD arrest in 2000 and 22,021? How many calls received

1098
01:10:46,204 --> 01:10:49,536
by emergency dispatch regarding a mental health crisis were responded to with

1099
01:10:49,558 --> 01:10:52,948
armed police officers in 2000 and 22,021? How many of

1100
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:56,612
those were part of a Cert team? How many of those were individual officers without

1101
01:10:56,666 --> 01:11:00,464
the support of a trained mental health professional? How many calls received by emergency

1102
01:11:00,512 --> 01:11:04,788
dispatch regarding a mental health crises were responded to with an unarmed

1103
01:11:04,884 --> 01:11:08,536
response through MCOT in 2000 and 22,021? I heard it would only

1104
01:11:08,558 --> 01:11:12,344
cost 23 million to expand Heart Holistic Assistance Response Team to cover

1105
01:11:12,382 --> 01:11:15,932
all of Harris County. Harris county currently has invested 1.2 million

1106
01:11:15,986 --> 01:11:19,628
for a pilot program. How would it relieve HPD officers to have such a

1107
01:11:19,634 --> 01:11:22,936
program expanded into Houston? Would the city of Houston consider expanding

1108
01:11:22,968 --> 01:11:26,168
the Heart pilot into Houston? To quote precinct

1109
01:11:26,184 --> 01:11:30,076
to Commissioner Adrian Garcia, heart is a historic investment

1110
01:11:30,108 --> 01:11:33,276
in public safety, and I'm excited to see this cutting edge program be launched

1111
01:11:33,308 --> 01:11:36,940
soon. As a longtime member of law enforcement who has seen firsthand

1112
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,648
what's happening in some communities, I know that having the right people respond

1113
01:11:40,684 --> 01:11:43,792
to a scene can make all the difference between a positive or tragic outcome.

1114
01:11:43,856 --> 01:11:47,204
Okay, thank you for your comments. What I would do is I would send that

1115
01:11:47,242 --> 01:11:50,496
exact list and give it to your council member, and let's

1116
01:11:50,528 --> 01:11:53,784
make sure that we have that answered, and we'll post that on SharePoint for

1117
01:11:53,822 --> 01:11:56,570
every council member. So thank you for your interest.

1118
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,376
Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you, Chair. And thank you

1119
01:12:00,398 --> 01:12:03,796
to the public speakers. I think this is hard. You've sat through a long meeting,

1120
01:12:03,828 --> 01:12:07,116
and you're really trying to spit it all out. I will have a form up

1121
01:12:07,138 --> 01:12:10,024
on my website, hopefully by the end of the day. I send it out via

1122
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:13,432
email where you can submit questions easily.

1123
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,352
We want to make sure we track all that too fast to write down.

1124
01:12:16,406 --> 01:12:20,252
But thank you very much for your participation, and we do respect

1125
01:12:20,316 --> 01:12:23,856
the fact that you have questions that you want answered. Thank you.

1126
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:27,440
And thank you for that notice. And also

1127
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:31,124
have council members questions that were asked during this session and other

1128
01:12:31,162 --> 01:12:34,676
sessions posted to SharePoint as well. And we'll make sure that we get

1129
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:38,244
those included for the public mr.

1130
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:40,020
Christopher Rivera.

1131
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,994
Hello, Nick. I'm glad some

1132
01:12:59,032 --> 01:13:02,478
council members mentioned the performance measures measurements.

1133
01:13:02,574 --> 01:13:06,386
My question is, why should the police department receive an additional $32 million

1134
01:13:06,488 --> 01:13:10,254
when they continue to fail and in some instances barely meet the department's

1135
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:14,326
2022 performance measurement goals? For example, the police set

1136
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:17,686
a response time goal of 75%. The police estimate they will

1137
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:21,654
only reach that goal by 55% this year,

1138
01:13:21,852 --> 01:13:25,078
failing to meet that goal by 20% next year, the police

1139
01:13:25,094 --> 01:13:29,206
will be lowering that goal to 65% to accommodate the police slow response.

1140
01:13:29,318 --> 01:13:33,446
Here's an instance when police barely reached their goal. The police department priority

1141
01:13:33,558 --> 01:13:37,306
was to have an average response time of four to six minutes. The police estimate

1142
01:13:37,338 --> 01:13:41,034
that the average response time is five minutes and 54 seconds. The previous

1143
01:13:41,082 --> 01:13:44,906
year's response time was slightly faster. Why should we continue invest

1144
01:13:44,948 --> 01:13:48,174
in systems that fail us when there is so much need for housing,

1145
01:13:48,302 --> 01:13:52,158
parks and services that benefit the community and doesn't criminalize

1146
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:54,610
us? I would like a response.

1147
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:59,250
Thank you, Mr. Rivera. No response.

1148
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:01,190
There are no council members in queue.

1149
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:03,750
Lauren Johnson,

1150
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,352
am I closing us out today? So just

1151
01:14:14,406 --> 01:14:17,916
to be fair, I heard you saying that we should submit

1152
01:14:17,948 --> 01:14:21,890
our questions to the council, and we'll do that, but also

1153
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:26,576
we couldn't have done that before because the presentations hadn't been

1154
01:14:26,598 --> 01:14:29,796
made. I know the slides were available, but also the process has been

1155
01:14:29,818 --> 01:14:32,310
different in previous days, so that wasn't possible.

1156
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,436
I was interested in hearing about the site and release program. I'd like to

1157
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:39,956
know a little more about how many times that has been used

1158
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:44,024
in 2000 and 22,021, and also if there

1159
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:48,104
are plans to expand it and find out where the problems

1160
01:14:48,222 --> 01:14:51,944
exist in that program. Because I think it should

1161
01:14:51,982 --> 01:14:55,164
be being used more and we haven't been seeing it live up to its full

1162
01:14:55,202 --> 01:14:58,284
potential. So I think it's important to identify what's going

1163
01:14:58,322 --> 01:15:02,364
on with that and how we can improve that program. That's it.

1164
01:15:02,482 --> 01:15:06,300
Thank you, Ms. Johnson. Thanks, Mr Peter Stout.

1165
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:16,900
Good afternoon, you all. Dr. Peter Stout, head nerd of the crime lab.

1166
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:21,654
I mostly showed up just to answer any questions. I figured there

1167
01:15:21,692 --> 01:15:25,814
probably would be some questions with HPD as we

1168
01:15:25,852 --> 01:15:29,350
are inextricably linked to what HPD does. They depend

1169
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:33,022
on our results for their investigative

1170
01:15:33,106 --> 01:15:37,130
investigations. The courts depend on our results for prosecutions.

1171
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:41,770
And if there are questions I can answer for you now about

1172
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,374
where we're at, I know there was one question, I forget who asked

1173
01:15:45,412 --> 01:15:50,014
it, about pages 456 and 457

1174
01:15:50,132 --> 01:15:54,030
are fund 20 213. That was the transitionary fund

1175
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,338
for the LGC when we started as the LGC. So right now it's

1176
01:15:57,354 --> 01:16:00,894
got three employees left in it. That's why that

1177
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:04,322
is only about 300,000. If you look for the rest of what our budget is,

1178
01:16:04,376 --> 01:16:07,986
is on page 233. There's one note in there of the 28

1179
01:16:08,008 --> 01:16:11,794
and a half million, and that is really the discussion of the difference between

1180
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:15,258
that and what my board passed and the differences

1181
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:17,702
of what that will mean for us, of what we can do in the coming

1182
01:16:17,756 --> 01:16:21,670
couple of years. But if there are questions, I'm happy. Yes. Council member. Leticia plummer.

1183
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:24,806
Thank you so much. And thank you, Dr. Staff, for everything that you do with

1184
01:16:24,828 --> 01:16:28,282
your whole entire team. Can you explain a little bit? I know there's a

1185
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:32,266
tell me exactly how much you're looking to need

1186
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:35,626
in terms of increase of your budget and then just a very quick synopsis of

1187
01:16:35,648 --> 01:16:39,406
what those those are going to be used for. Certainly what my board passed was

1188
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:41,440
34.4 million.

1189
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:46,614
That includes 2.6 million for wage

1190
01:16:46,682 --> 01:16:50,450
adjustments. We are getting our heads handed to us in retention and recruiting.

1191
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:54,606
There's about a million in there to expand the crime scene

1192
01:16:54,638 --> 01:16:58,498
unit. There is about

1193
01:16:58,664 --> 01:17:02,326
500,000 in there. And we basically walk down the

1194
01:17:02,348 --> 01:17:07,062
places that we are the most concerned. Crime scene firearms next.

1195
01:17:07,116 --> 01:17:10,466
After that is toxicology Layton prints.

1196
01:17:10,578 --> 01:17:14,134
And the balance of that, this is about a $5.9

1197
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:18,026
million difference from this year's budget into next year.

1198
01:17:18,128 --> 01:17:21,846
So it's between staffing and then trying to stabilize the growth

1199
01:17:21,878 --> 01:17:23,340
of the backlogs that we're seeing.

1200
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:29,866
Another question, and if you receive that money, do you believe that we could decrease

1201
01:17:29,898 --> 01:17:33,550
the backlog that we have currently? I don't think so.

1202
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:36,720
Okay. And this is part of the concern that I have.

1203
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,302
We have had backlogs grow somewhere between

1204
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:43,666
twice to about five fold, depending on which discipline you're looking

1205
01:17:43,688 --> 01:17:46,926
at. The difficulty for us is we are disproportionately affected

1206
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:50,046
by homicide in particular, creates a lot of evidence.

1207
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:54,178
The evidence that it creates goes to our most expensive disciplines. So it's

1208
01:17:54,194 --> 01:17:57,510
really disproportionate in the impact that it has on the laboratory.

1209
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:03,930
It is very long arc for us, training examiners

1210
01:18:04,990 --> 01:18:08,966
finding equipment. So really, if I were to try and eliminate

1211
01:18:08,998 --> 01:18:12,058
the backlog, that would probably take something more in the neighborhood of

1212
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:16,054
45 million. Even if that number were realistic, I couldn't

1213
01:18:16,102 --> 01:18:19,694
spend it. I can't find the people, I can't find the equipment in this next

1214
01:18:19,732 --> 01:18:23,086
year. So the 34 is designed to work

1215
01:18:23,108 --> 01:18:27,070
with what we've got and try and stabilize the growth of the backlogs.

1216
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:33,166
We have 200 amazing people. I have full confidence

1217
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:36,706
they will probably exceed expectations. But so that you have an

1218
01:18:36,728 --> 01:18:40,990
understanding of the expectations of what that's designed for, it is to stabilize backlogs,

1219
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:44,926
not reduce anything. Council member

1220
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:48,242
Abbey Cayman. Thank you, Dr Stout.

1221
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:51,442
Just so we're clear, when we talk about evidence

1222
01:18:51,506 --> 01:18:54,854
backlogs, that's distinct from the current court backlog.

1223
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:58,202
Correct. Do you want to expand upon that a little bit? Oh,

1224
01:18:58,256 --> 01:19:01,786
boy. Yeah. So a crime laboratory gets to

1225
01:19:01,808 --> 01:19:05,502
be sandwiched between law enforcement doing

1226
01:19:05,556 --> 01:19:09,454
investigations and we do evidence processing as

1227
01:19:09,492 --> 01:19:12,240
part of investigations. And as law enforcement builds a case,

1228
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:16,762
then law enforcement hands that case over to prosecutors

1229
01:19:16,906 --> 01:19:21,122
to develop the case for prosecution. At that point,

1230
01:19:21,176 --> 01:19:25,570
there is a whole nother suite of requests we often get that come from prosecution.

1231
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:30,206
So for us, we've got the increase in particularly

1232
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,118
homicide over the last couple of years that sandwiched us from that side

1233
01:19:34,284 --> 01:19:38,434
now with the absolutely mind boggling backlog in the courts

1234
01:19:38,562 --> 01:19:42,054
as that is picking back up the pressure from

1235
01:19:42,092 --> 01:19:45,590
that to support past results that we've done in court

1236
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:49,354
goes up. And the request from prosecutors who are now starting to deal

1237
01:19:49,392 --> 01:19:53,606
with cases goes up. So right now my folks are testifying on violent crime

1238
01:19:53,638 --> 01:19:57,434
cases typically from about 2017, 2018 as

1239
01:19:57,472 --> 01:20:00,702
the courts catch up to where we're at. This is part of my concern is

1240
01:20:00,756 --> 01:20:03,966
somewhere in about the next six to twelve months we start to become the

1241
01:20:03,988 --> 01:20:07,166
backlog and the bottleneck because the courts are then

1242
01:20:07,188 --> 01:20:10,850
going to start waiting on us for results on cases when they get there.

1243
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,562
Right now we're not just to be clear as it stands today,

1244
01:20:14,616 --> 01:20:18,002
and I appreciate it always helps right when we have people saying,

1245
01:20:18,056 --> 01:20:20,966
hey, in about six months or a year we're going to have a challenge and

1246
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:24,278
we need to be looking at that now. So I appreciate that very much.

1247
01:20:24,364 --> 01:20:27,874
And right now the court

1248
01:20:27,922 --> 01:20:32,202
backlog is not hinging on

1249
01:20:32,336 --> 01:20:35,450
the incredible work that the Forensic Science Center is doing.

1250
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,522
The DA's office is not hinged on that

1251
01:20:40,576 --> 01:20:44,218
either. No, that's not where at right now. You can see the

1252
01:20:44,224 --> 01:20:47,674
arc of this. I joke explaining our work

1253
01:20:47,712 --> 01:20:50,926
is a little bit more like explaining orbital dynamics than it is like driving a

1254
01:20:50,948 --> 01:20:54,446
car. Because what we do now for us impacts where we're at in

1255
01:20:54,468 --> 01:20:57,534
about two years. And my concern is even

1256
01:20:57,572 --> 01:21:00,866
if you back the truckload of money over on me in two years,

1257
01:21:01,048 --> 01:21:04,414
I can't do much with it for another two years. Understood,

1258
01:21:04,462 --> 01:21:07,140
but I really appreciate the clarification. Thank you.

1259
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:11,174
So a follow up. So your backlog is

1260
01:21:11,212 --> 01:21:14,406
related to people and equipment. Correct. Okay. So you have

1261
01:21:14,428 --> 01:21:17,926
a homicide today looking at a presentation that

1262
01:21:17,948 --> 01:21:21,526
you had given ways back. We won't get

1263
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:25,580
to the evidence because of the backlog that we have for three years.

1264
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:29,414
And if that employee who's doing the evidence collection

1265
01:21:29,462 --> 01:21:33,098
and the data leaves, the clock starts over again.

1266
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,650
So that employee goes back to day one and that three years

1267
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,914
was wasted. Yeah. This is a consistent

1268
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:43,326
problem for us and really for every laboratory in the state as we

1269
01:21:43,348 --> 01:21:47,674
have employees that leave and this is part of the cost to me for employees,

1270
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:51,694
we figure. And I was just at the meeting of American Society

1271
01:21:51,742 --> 01:21:54,338
Crime Laboratory directors a couple of weeks ago.

1272
01:21:54,504 --> 01:21:58,210
Most labs, it's somewhere between 300,000 and $500,000

1273
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,510
to train a new analyst just out of the box,

1274
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:05,366
somewhere between about a year to three years before they're productive in

1275
01:22:05,388 --> 01:22:09,586
the laboratory. If they leave in the court,

1276
01:22:09,778 --> 01:22:13,446
unless we can get that person to come back and testify about that,

1277
01:22:13,548 --> 01:22:17,338
the evidence becomes hearsay. So most prosecutors will want

1278
01:22:17,424 --> 01:22:20,922
and pressure us to rework the case with somebody that's actually currently

1279
01:22:20,976 --> 01:22:24,426
employed. So you can almost take when an employee leaves, you can

1280
01:22:24,448 --> 01:22:27,326
take the work that they've done for about the last three to five years and

1281
01:22:27,348 --> 01:22:31,310
throw it out the way backlog. Absolutely. So what's the solution?

1282
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:34,970
We have to stay ahead of the curve.

1283
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:38,814
And this is why, to Council Member Cayman's point right

1284
01:22:38,852 --> 01:22:42,402
now, we're not the problem. I am desperately trying

1285
01:22:42,456 --> 01:22:46,146
to not be the problem about two years from now, because we

1286
01:22:46,168 --> 01:22:49,766
have to try and stay ahead of the arc of this, knowing all of these

1287
01:22:49,788 --> 01:22:54,070
challenges that we have to get equipment in to validate things to train employees

1288
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:59,430
so that two years from now, we aren't the headline.

1289
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:03,154
So I would invite Chair Cayman

1290
01:23:03,202 --> 01:23:07,046
to bring this up in one of your public safety. Because when I started reviewing

1291
01:23:07,078 --> 01:23:10,554
the material for today's presentation, I went back and looked at

1292
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:14,074
the position that if somebody leaves, then you start the clock all over

1293
01:23:14,112 --> 01:23:17,534
again, and you just wasted three years. And that person sits in jail for six

1294
01:23:17,572 --> 01:23:21,534
years instead of three until the trial comes. So I'd love to

1295
01:23:21,572 --> 01:23:24,160
dig into this a little bit more when we have more time.

1296
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:28,606
Those conversations and the planning for that we're speaking,

1297
01:23:28,788 --> 01:23:32,002
those are conversations that we're currently having right now. Okay, great.

1298
01:23:32,056 --> 01:23:35,506
Thank you. No other council members in queue. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much.

1299
01:23:35,528 --> 01:23:39,026
I appreciate your support. Yes. Thanks, Dr. Sal. Appreciate what you

1300
01:23:39,048 --> 01:23:44,098
do. Joe Grochell followed

1301
01:23:44,114 --> 01:23:46,630
by Melissa Martinez and Aris Brown.

1302
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,060
So we are spending $8 million on community affairs.

1303
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:59,552
This seems like a very expensive duplication of

1304
01:23:59,606 --> 01:24:02,800
city services, especially neighborhoods,

1305
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,756
which could be beneficial for all the other departments we've been

1306
01:24:06,778 --> 01:24:10,324
hearing from. Would council members consider

1307
01:24:10,442 --> 01:24:12,500
and support consolidation?

1308
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,204
And then my other question is in

1309
01:24:20,242 --> 01:24:23,696
what the police said in his objectives is how

1310
01:24:23,718 --> 01:24:25,680
do you measure reduce fear?

1311
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:31,232
I would like him to like you all to figure that out. How do you

1312
01:24:31,286 --> 01:24:34,944
measure reduce fear? If you

1313
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:38,496
write those questions I'm sure you have in your notes, submit it to your council

1314
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,844
member. We will enter that and we will get the answers within 48 hours.

1315
01:24:41,962 --> 01:24:46,020
Thank you, and thanks again for coming. You're welcome. Melissa Martinez.

1316
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,350
Hi.

1317
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,736
I have a couple of questions, such as how many unhoused

1318
01:25:01,768 --> 01:25:05,212
students and how many the in house and

1319
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:09,904
students have been arrested by HPD in 2000 and 22,021?

1320
01:25:10,102 --> 01:25:13,484
Because I know that a lot of council members have previously

1321
01:25:13,532 --> 01:25:17,696
discussed about all these cases of domestic abuse

1322
01:25:17,728 --> 01:25:21,700
and all these other abusive, very violent

1323
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,796
situations. And I wanted to follow up with another question,

1324
01:25:25,898 --> 01:25:29,690
because after listening to other departments that were brought up here today

1325
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:34,216
on how some, even you yourself, praise how

1326
01:25:34,318 --> 01:25:38,408
much they could do while being underfunded within

1327
01:25:38,494 --> 01:25:41,908
their own limited, low budgets. And I wanted to ask if

1328
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:45,404
there could be a possibility with all these issues of

1329
01:25:45,442 --> 01:25:48,876
being at the intersections and facing these violences that they

1330
01:25:48,898 --> 01:25:52,792
do need to be funded, such as housing in public

1331
01:25:52,946 --> 01:25:57,170
libraries, the public recreations. As myself,

1332
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:03,824
I am a survivor of domestic abuse. And those are those

1333
01:26:03,862 --> 01:26:06,880
things yes, ma'am. That helped me. Yes, ma'am.

1334
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:10,576
So it comes down to it's an easy equation.

1335
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:13,620
It's revenue versus expenses.

1336
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,376
Revenue is capped. We receive revenue

1337
01:26:17,408 --> 01:26:21,332
from basically two sources property taxes

1338
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:24,824
and sales taxes. Our sales tax projections look

1339
01:26:24,862 --> 01:26:28,516
pretty good. Unfortunately, with inflation taking place, the cost of goods

1340
01:26:28,548 --> 01:26:32,364
are going up. Thus our sales tax revenue has gone up. This will

1341
01:26:32,402 --> 01:26:35,980
be the 8th year out of the past nine years that

1342
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:39,820
we've had a tax rate decrease.

1343
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:44,272
And the tax rate is a function well, your taxes on your

1344
01:26:44,326 --> 01:26:47,676
homestead is a function of two variables.

1345
01:26:47,788 --> 01:26:51,728
The tax rate that we have times your value

1346
01:26:51,814 --> 01:26:56,036
of your home. That's the revenue we receive on the

1347
01:26:56,138 --> 01:27:00,084
property tax. So we're capped by the

1348
01:27:00,122 --> 01:27:03,712
state of Texas so that every year we have to reduce

1349
01:27:03,776 --> 01:27:07,360
our tax rate, which means we don't get the ability

1350
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:11,208
to spend the money that is coming in via property

1351
01:27:11,294 --> 01:27:14,680
taxes because it is capped, as is every major

1352
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:19,044
city in the state of Texas. However, the cap we're

1353
01:27:19,092 --> 01:27:22,612
under is different than the cap. Dallas is under,

1354
01:27:22,766 --> 01:27:25,884
san Antonio is under, and Austin is under

1355
01:27:25,922 --> 01:27:29,356
because they're on a lesser cap. So when you look

1356
01:27:29,378 --> 01:27:33,004
at property taxes, the tax rate has gone down eight of the last

1357
01:27:33,042 --> 01:27:36,684
nine years. When you look at sales tax revenue,

1358
01:27:36,812 --> 01:27:39,984
we've had some tough times during COVID but the projections look

1359
01:27:40,022 --> 01:27:43,356
better. At the same time, our personnel costs

1360
01:27:43,388 --> 01:27:46,948
are increasing. Police 4%

1361
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:51,396
salary increase come July 1 fire 6%

1362
01:27:51,498 --> 01:27:55,284
salary increase come July 1 city Employees and

1363
01:27:55,322 --> 01:27:58,912
municipal Employees 3% July

1364
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:03,064
1 and you saw in the information we were presented that 65%

1365
01:28:03,102 --> 01:28:06,568
of our overall budget on the expense side is due to

1366
01:28:06,734 --> 01:28:10,208
personnel. So when you have those equations,

1367
01:28:10,404 --> 01:28:13,624
it's a no win situation unless

1368
01:28:13,672 --> 01:28:17,196
you go out and tell people in the city of Houston, do you want your

1369
01:28:17,218 --> 01:28:18,780
taxes to increase?

1370
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,756
Every year I do this and I announce it to fellow council members. I look

1371
01:28:25,778 --> 01:28:29,424
at my tax bill and I share it publicly. And in my

1372
01:28:29,462 --> 01:28:33,232
tax bill this year that I paid in February, the amount

1373
01:28:33,286 --> 01:28:37,268
of dollars that I gave to the city of Houston was 19%

1374
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,270
of my overall tax bill.

1375
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,910
My school district taxes are 56%.

1376
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,816
We had an election on Saturday for a bond referendum that passed

1377
01:28:48,848 --> 01:28:52,000
overwhelmingly. But yet, every time

1378
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:55,364
I'm out in public, people look at me and say, your taxes

1379
01:28:55,412 --> 01:28:58,712
are way too high in the city of Houston. And I point

1380
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:02,104
back to my school district taxes. Yeah, you get

1381
01:29:02,142 --> 01:29:06,424
what you pay for. But I have no children anymore

1382
01:29:06,552 --> 01:29:09,724
that are in the K through twelve education and I look

1383
01:29:09,762 --> 01:29:13,176
really closely at the dollars that are spent in my particular school district.

1384
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:17,216
So I've rambled way too much. But we have a no win situation

1385
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:20,716
in the city of Houston because of the property tax cap that we're

1386
01:29:20,748 --> 01:29:24,608
under and the sales tax revenue projections that

1387
01:29:24,614 --> 01:29:27,820
we see coming at us. Because basically, we have those two sources.

1388
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:31,396
And if I ask Joe Q public if they want their taxes increased by

1389
01:29:31,418 --> 01:29:34,550
the city, they'll say, not no, but heck no.

1390
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:39,188
Thank you. I wanted to follow up real quick because we got to

1391
01:29:39,194 --> 01:29:42,456
get out about all these caps on the taxes. And I

1392
01:29:42,478 --> 01:29:46,852
was asking that's why I was directing it towards HBD,

1393
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:50,876
having all these allocations of funds, and that way

1394
01:29:50,978 --> 01:29:55,100
that other departments could be invested through those instead

1395
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:59,240
of just hiring these tax caps that you were mentioning.

1396
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,550
Yes. Thank you,

1397
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:06,592
Eris Brown. Last but not least

1398
01:30:06,646 --> 01:30:07,490
for the day.

1399
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:17,080
Hello, city Council. I just want to say it's particularly heartbreaking

1400
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:20,808
to sit and a lot of people have come from their jobs

1401
01:30:20,824 --> 01:30:24,832
and are not able to receive income because they're here,

1402
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:27,936
and not to be able to have their questions answered by the folks who make

1403
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:31,444
the presentations. And so I did want to mention that my

1404
01:30:31,482 --> 01:30:36,448
first question is research has shown strategically

1405
01:30:36,624 --> 01:30:39,472
and well designed parks can reduce gun violence,

1406
01:30:39,536 --> 01:30:42,864
improve safety, and keep residents healthier with the council

1407
01:30:42,912 --> 01:30:45,960
see a benefit in allocating some of the resources to the

1408
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:49,656
very clearly underfunded Parks and Recreation Department. But what would

1409
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:52,916
alleviate the work that needs to be done by HPD officers?

1410
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:55,588
We've been talking a lot about prevention,

1411
01:30:55,764 --> 01:30:59,596
and a lot of the measures that we've thought about with HPD's presentation have

1412
01:30:59,618 --> 01:31:03,196
been reactive. Adding more, doing this. Are we interested in

1413
01:31:03,218 --> 01:31:07,032
more preventative measures by funding through parks and recreation

1414
01:31:07,096 --> 01:31:11,310
libraries, et cetera? My first question, my second question is

1415
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,672
the PFM report. And Chief Finner's comments last year

1416
01:31:16,726 --> 01:31:20,176
showed that we've had police officers doing the work that can and should be

1417
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:23,524
done by civilians. I wanted to know if there has been a shift in that

1418
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:27,940
practice at all. If you go to the website, HPD has about 5400

1419
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:31,552
officers and 892 civilians.

1420
01:31:31,616 --> 01:31:35,224
I'm interested if we've made any sort of shifts in those past couple

1421
01:31:35,262 --> 01:31:36,010
of years.

1422
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,400
Thank you for your question. If you look at personnel,

1423
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:47,160
classified versus civilian,

1424
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:51,390
classified was 93%, civilian was 7%

1425
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:57,144
in the 2023 budget. And then the personnel

1426
01:31:57,272 --> 01:32:01,500
on we'll get back with you. There's a number of different categories

1427
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:05,564
with that. So if you would post your question to your council member,

1428
01:32:05,692 --> 01:32:08,924
we'll make sure that question is answered.

1429
01:32:08,972 --> 01:32:12,192
Council Member Ed Pollard. Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM.

1430
01:32:12,246 --> 01:32:16,352
And thank you to all the speakers who spent time coming in person to

1431
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:19,524
address your question. One I would like to see the study so I can see

1432
01:32:19,562 --> 01:32:22,276
what you're reading. So if you want to send that to our offices, that would

1433
01:32:22,298 --> 01:32:25,736
be great. I think there's always ways in

1434
01:32:25,758 --> 01:32:29,476
which we can look at preventative measures through either different programs,

1435
01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:32,280
after school programs, parks, libraries,

1436
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:36,364
and it would be great if we could have some additional dollars for those

1437
01:32:36,402 --> 01:32:39,112
programs. I think from parks,

1438
01:32:39,176 --> 01:32:42,668
libraries, airports, police, fire, they're all going

1439
01:32:42,674 --> 01:32:46,750
to say, we need more. There's not one department that's going to say

1440
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:51,184
we couldn't perform better if we had more dollars.

1441
01:32:51,302 --> 01:32:55,120
And so from our standpoint, we have to make reasonable

1442
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:59,170
decisions regarding where those allocations are.

1443
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:03,860
Every single night you turn on the news, all you hear is issues

1444
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:07,412
with public safety. That is the number one email we get.

1445
01:33:07,466 --> 01:33:09,430
That is the number one call we get.

1446
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,512
Whenever we go to homeowners associations, people are talking about crime.

1447
01:33:14,576 --> 01:33:17,464
They're also talking about trash. They're also talking about a couple of other things,

1448
01:33:17,502 --> 01:33:21,400
but they're always talking about crime. So we have to find ways in which

1449
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:25,016
to provide adequate law enforcement and

1450
01:33:25,038 --> 01:33:28,396
public safety, but also kind of reimagine it that it's not

1451
01:33:28,418 --> 01:33:31,676
always in the same way. So to think

1452
01:33:31,698 --> 01:33:34,856
about police officers not always having to serve

1453
01:33:34,888 --> 01:33:37,976
in traditional roles, I think Council Member Leticia Plummer,

1454
01:33:38,008 --> 01:33:41,664
she brought forth an amendment last year regarding having more

1455
01:33:41,702 --> 01:33:45,296
clinicians and technicians and medical professionals. And that's something that

1456
01:33:45,318 --> 01:33:49,056
the mayor has put forth in his One Safe Houston plan.

1457
01:33:49,158 --> 01:33:52,384
So we are looking at ways in which to not have

1458
01:33:52,422 --> 01:33:55,876
the same type of traditional police officers do, the same type

1459
01:33:55,898 --> 01:33:59,664
of traditional duties, but it's something that we need to continue to explore

1460
01:33:59,712 --> 01:34:02,260
to see how we can make those additional steps.

1461
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,456
Right. And thanks for Ms. Brown, for your comments. As we talked about in

1462
01:34:06,478 --> 01:34:10,564
their session, we've increased the budget projected to increase the budget

1463
01:34:10,612 --> 01:34:14,632
in police. But the way we allocate those dollars are a lot different this year

1464
01:34:14,686 --> 01:34:18,536
moving forward versus last year piggybacking police with mental

1465
01:34:18,568 --> 01:34:22,204
health problems, the homeless initiative that we have a big situation

1466
01:34:22,322 --> 01:34:25,484
with. So to Council Member Pollard's point,

1467
01:34:25,682 --> 01:34:29,180
using the dollars a little bit differently moving forward

1468
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:32,896
than we do today, we don't think reimagination. I'm interested in

1469
01:34:32,918 --> 01:34:36,272
how we can imagine these things outside of the methods that haven't worked,

1470
01:34:36,326 --> 01:34:40,064
like the police department and actually putting them in programs that can work

1471
01:34:40,102 --> 01:34:43,216
if we're thinking about reimagination, right? Yes, ma'am. I think

1472
01:34:43,238 --> 01:34:47,152
that'd be a difference of opinion and perspective on what may

1473
01:34:47,206 --> 01:34:50,256
work and what does not work. And I think those are discussions we need to

1474
01:34:50,278 --> 01:34:54,072
continue to have. Absolutely. And I appreciate you making

1475
01:34:54,126 --> 01:34:57,048
those comments. And if you could provide the information on that study, I'd love to

1476
01:34:57,054 --> 01:35:00,344
read it. Absolutely. Thank you. You're welcome. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. There are no other

1477
01:35:00,382 --> 01:35:03,764
public speaking meeting adjourned until tomorrow. We'll pick up budget

1478
01:35:03,812 --> 01:35:07,050
meetings at 01:00 with Houston Airport System.
