WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:03.546
This concludes our Administrative and Regulatory Affairs Budget

00:03.578 --> 00:07.066
workshop. We will now begin our budget workshop for the municipal

00:07.098 --> 00:10.586
courts. And at this time, I would like to welcome Judge

00:10.618 --> 00:13.966
Elaine Marshall and CFO Nellie Santos to

00:13.988 --> 00:16.750
provide the municipal courts budget presentation.

00:24.330 --> 00:28.720
Put the chair up too high. Thank. Thank you.

00:31.010 --> 00:33.390
Welcome, your Honor. And that floor is yours.

00:34.690 --> 00:40.640
And good afternoon and

00:40.950 --> 00:44.498
council members. I am here and it is my pleasure to present today the

00:44.504 --> 00:48.222
Municipal Court Department's FY 23 Budget.

00:48.366 --> 00:52.206
Attending with me today is McD's Chief Financial Officer,

00:52.238 --> 00:55.750
Deputy Director Nellie Santos, and she's seated with me today

00:55.820 --> 00:59.010
as well as members of my executive team who are in the audience.

00:59.170 --> 01:02.582
This presentation is reflective of our commitment to

01:02.636 --> 01:06.182
our community to provide court services in an equitable

01:06.246 --> 01:09.340
and safe manner. Next slide, please.

01:10.510 --> 01:13.846
Our General Fund consists of seven cost centers,

01:13.958 --> 01:17.706
each of them having budgets assigned, staffed, and specific core

01:17.738 --> 01:20.910
services. This slide includes four of the seven

01:20.980 --> 01:24.634
cost centers. The system support cost. Center has no assigned

01:24.682 --> 01:26.830
FTEs. Next slide.

01:28.210 --> 01:31.954
This slide includes the remaining three General Fund cost

01:31.992 --> 01:33.890
centers. Next slide.

01:35.190 --> 01:39.346
Municipal Court also manages four special funds that provide specific

01:39.448 --> 01:43.314
services, including security, technology, and truancy

01:43.362 --> 01:47.078
prevention. The Municipal Jury Fund is our fourth special

01:47.164 --> 01:50.534
fund and currently has no assigned FTEs or

01:50.572 --> 01:54.102
expenditure budget. This is a newly created fund and

01:54.156 --> 01:58.086
expenditures will be budgeted once the fund balance increases.

01:58.198 --> 01:59.420
Next slide, please.

02:01.230 --> 02:04.474
Listed on this slide are McD's major services.

02:04.672 --> 02:08.014
These services help us to achieve our overall goals and

02:08.052 --> 02:10.430
our mission. Next slide.

02:11.890 --> 02:15.646
Our courts are mandated by law to provide a legal forum for

02:15.668 --> 02:19.406
the individuals charged with criminal offenses. Included in

02:19.428 --> 02:23.122
these mandates are the right to a jury trial, equal access to

02:23.176 --> 02:26.754
the legal system, and adherence to our state and local law.

02:26.952 --> 02:28.260
Next slide, please.

02:33.850 --> 02:37.346
Sorry. Oh. Next slide,

02:37.378 --> 02:41.334
please. MCD has

02:41.372 --> 02:45.438
many internal revenue generating initiatives that provide enhanced

02:45.474 --> 02:48.934
court services to the public and assist municipal courts

02:48.982 --> 02:53.094
in achieving its overall revenue target. These services include

02:53.142 --> 02:56.614
passports, weddings notary, and the printing of driving

02:56.662 --> 03:00.590
records to better serve target areas within our community.

03:00.740 --> 03:04.426
We have various specialized dockets that provide meaningful

03:04.538 --> 03:07.034
and safe methods for case resolution,

03:07.162 --> 03:10.602
including the Veterans Court and the Safe Harbor Court.

03:10.746 --> 03:14.542
Judges assigned to these dockets have the ability to reduce fines,

03:14.606 --> 03:18.414
offer payment plans, or other methods of case resolution

03:18.462 --> 03:21.634
to individuals who are experiencing hardships but who

03:21.672 --> 03:24.882
still want to fulfill their legal obligations to the court.

03:25.026 --> 03:28.694
I'm happy to report that Teen Court was able to resume their

03:28.732 --> 03:32.774
in person monthly activities in FY 22. This program

03:32.892 --> 03:37.046
has made long lasting impressions on the lives of our youth by providing

03:37.078 --> 03:40.934
a glimpse at the legal system through firsthand participation

03:41.062 --> 03:44.838
and through mentorship provided by our professional volunteers.

03:44.934 --> 03:48.494
Next slide, please. I think

03:48.532 --> 03:52.126
we're one slide ahead of me now. There we

03:52.148 --> 03:55.742
go. MCD began decentralizing court services

03:55.876 --> 03:59.166
many years ago, anticipating the future growth in

03:59.188 --> 04:02.546
the population. We serve our full service courts can

04:02.568 --> 04:06.494
be found in key areas of the city and they include our central

04:06.542 --> 04:09.774
location, Macawa, West Side and North

04:09.822 --> 04:13.250
Command. We also have annex courts that are open

04:13.320 --> 04:16.662
and located in Kingwood and the Clear Lake areas which are open

04:16.716 --> 04:20.034
one day per week, and a court at the Joint Processing

04:20.082 --> 04:24.066
Center which we perform and they handle jail, dockets and magistrate

04:24.098 --> 04:27.706
court services, and we do those. That court is in

04:27.728 --> 04:30.442
operation seven days a week, 22 hours a day,

04:30.496 --> 04:34.454
365 days a year. We also anticipated

04:34.502 --> 04:38.382
the greater use of technology and have implemented many web

04:38.436 --> 04:41.678
based processes. Our short term messaging service

04:41.764 --> 04:45.214
provides text messages and email reminders to our

04:45.252 --> 04:48.574
customers about upcoming scheduled court dates, as well

04:48.612 --> 04:52.210
as important emergency notifications to address

04:52.280 --> 04:56.434
the needs of our diverse community and to allow full participation in the

04:56.472 --> 05:00.062
legal service. We have full time certified Spanish

05:00.126 --> 05:04.002
interpreters as well as access to other languages through contract

05:04.066 --> 05:07.480
services and the language line. Next slide, please.

05:09.770 --> 05:13.522
This slide represents a comparison of revenue for FY

05:13.586 --> 05:17.066
21, FY 22 and FY 23 for

05:17.088 --> 05:20.218
all MCD funds and the percentage change

05:20.304 --> 05:24.330
between the FY 23 proposed and the FY 22

05:24.400 --> 05:28.826
estimates. As reflected, there is an overall 3% decrease

05:28.858 --> 05:32.270
in revenue across all funds for FY 23.

05:32.420 --> 05:36.490
Next slide, please. Despite the COVID challenges

05:36.570 --> 05:40.234
and the lower rate of citation issuance, we expect FY

05:40.282 --> 05:43.586
22 General Fund revenues to exceed the

05:43.608 --> 05:47.266
budget target. This increase is attributed to the resumption of

05:47.288 --> 05:51.374
all the dockets, including cases that were delayed during the suspension

05:51.422 --> 05:54.934
period. This increase is also due to the high level of

05:54.972 --> 05:58.466
performance from our internal and external collection teams,

05:58.578 --> 06:02.306
McD's revenue generated initiatives, and the deferred

06:02.338 --> 06:05.510
payment program for FY 23.

06:05.660 --> 06:09.226
We project a slight decrease in General Fund revenue from the

06:09.248 --> 06:12.586
FY 22 projection due to a reduction in the

06:12.608 --> 06:16.102
number of backlog cases and a continued lower citation

06:16.166 --> 06:20.074
rates. Next slide, please. This slide

06:20.122 --> 06:23.402
includes revenue highlights for our four MCD

06:23.466 --> 06:26.718
special funds. The annual variances in

06:26.724 --> 06:30.318
the revenue budgets for the funds remain in line with the General

06:30.404 --> 06:33.746
Fund for FY 23. We anticipate a

06:33.768 --> 06:37.266
reduction in the grant funding from the office of the Governor for our

06:37.288 --> 06:40.654
Juvenile Case Manager Truancy Prevention initiative.

06:40.782 --> 06:44.770
Through this grant, we have been able to expand our program to additional

06:44.850 --> 06:49.174
schools. However, this reduction may negatively impact the

06:49.212 --> 06:53.154
services we provide to our partner school districts. Next slide,

06:53.202 --> 06:56.906
please. This slide represents a

06:56.928 --> 06:59.962
comparison of expenditures for FY 21,

07:00.096 --> 07:03.434
FY 22 and FY 23 for all

07:03.472 --> 07:07.542
MCD funds and the percentage change between FY

07:07.606 --> 07:10.930
23 proposed and FY 22 budgets.

07:11.030 --> 07:15.230
There is a 2.3 overall increase in expenditures across

07:15.300 --> 07:18.302
all MCD funds for FY 23.

07:18.436 --> 07:19.760
Next slide, please.

07:21.510 --> 07:25.314
80% of the General Fund expenditure budget consists of

07:25.352 --> 07:29.326
personnel cost. The remaining 20% is non

07:29.358 --> 07:32.858
personnel costs that include inner fund accounts, CSMART,

07:32.894 --> 07:36.274
support supplies and services. Next slide,

07:36.322 --> 07:36.920
please.

07:38.570 --> 07:42.354
99% of the building security fund expenditure

07:42.402 --> 07:45.782
budget is non personnel and it includes contract

07:45.846 --> 07:49.334
security services. The remaining 1% of the budget

07:49.382 --> 07:53.034
is personnel and is related to the retiree health benefits

07:53.152 --> 07:55.340
cost. Next slide, please.

07:56.750 --> 08:00.490
The majority of the court technology fund expenditure budget

08:00.570 --> 08:03.790
is nonpersonal. It includes software and

08:03.940 --> 08:06.490
hardware licensing, maintenance costs,

08:06.570 --> 08:10.374
CSMART support and other planned technology enhancements.

08:10.522 --> 08:13.906
The remaining 18% is personnel cost.

08:14.008 --> 08:17.666
Next slide, please. 90% of

08:17.688 --> 08:21.778
the local Tourancy Prevention and Diversion Fund

08:21.944 --> 08:25.634
expenditure budget is personnel costs. The remaining

08:25.682 --> 08:29.046
10% is non personnel cost, including education

08:29.148 --> 08:32.566
and training supplies, as well as teen court and

08:32.588 --> 08:35.610
student engagement activities. Next slide.

08:36.990 --> 08:40.682
This worksheet provides an overview of the expenditure net

08:40.736 --> 08:44.182
change between the FY 22 and the FY

08:44.246 --> 08:47.854
23 General Fund budgets. FY 23

08:47.892 --> 08:51.402
reflects a 2.2% increase in expenditures.

08:51.546 --> 08:55.162
This increase is due to the resumption of dockets and the related

08:55.226 --> 08:59.118
increases in court services, noticing jury cost,

08:59.204 --> 09:02.778
postage language services, variances in the inner

09:02.794 --> 09:06.770
fund accounts, pension and health benefit rates, and the two Hope

09:06.840 --> 09:09.940
3% increases. Next slide, please.

09:10.790 --> 09:14.690
This slide provides our FY 23 expenditure highlights

09:14.770 --> 09:17.906
for the General Fund. We will continue to maintain

09:17.938 --> 09:21.522
the court CSMART System fund, contractual increases

09:21.586 --> 09:25.302
in the security and armored car service, language services,

09:25.436 --> 09:28.870
passport program costs, and citation book printing.

09:28.950 --> 09:32.694
Next slide, please. This slide provides

09:32.742 --> 09:36.614
expenditure highlights for our four special revenue funds.

09:36.742 --> 09:40.686
Expenditures in these funds include contract security services,

09:40.868 --> 09:44.794
technology maintenance and enhancement cost, and Truancy

09:44.842 --> 09:48.394
prevention services. Two of these four funds include

09:48.442 --> 09:50.770
personnel cost. Next slide.

09:51.590 --> 09:55.554
This concludes the budget portion. Now we'll proceed to the next section of

09:55.592 --> 09:59.374
this presentation. The next section of the presentation will highlight

09:59.422 --> 10:03.080
other department level information. Next slide, please.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.346
This list provides more detail regarding our citywide

10:07.458 --> 10:11.062
interfund our citywide restricted accounts. Sorry.

10:11.116 --> 10:14.482
Next slide, please. The MCD

10:14.546 --> 10:18.634
organizational chart on this slide includes our leadership team and

10:18.672 --> 10:23.050
lines of direct and indirect reporting. Next slide.

10:24.510 --> 10:28.774
The information provided here reflects the diversity of our municipal court

10:28.822 --> 10:30.960
team. Next slide, please.

10:32.370 --> 10:36.122
I am pleased to be able to share with you some of our major accomplishments

10:36.186 --> 10:39.754
from this past year on the next two slides. While we remained

10:39.802 --> 10:43.134
operational throughout COVID Pandemic, we suspended

10:43.182 --> 10:46.610
regular dockets and jury service for over a year.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.354
This resulted in a large number of our cases that needed to be

10:50.392 --> 10:53.874
reset and rescheduled. We have worked diligently

10:54.002 --> 10:57.974
since then, resuming dockets from last April to reschedule these

10:58.012 --> 11:01.670
cases, handle the volume of new cases, and maintain lower

11:01.740 --> 11:05.514
docket levels to meet safe distancing requirements. We also

11:05.552 --> 11:08.982
summoned jurors at a reduced level and found a solution

11:09.046 --> 11:12.346
for masking by implementing a clear mask option for

11:12.368 --> 11:16.394
the jurors selected for trials. Our Passport program

11:16.512 --> 11:19.690
is celebrating its first year anniversary.

11:19.770 --> 11:23.406
To date, our Passport program has assisted almost 3000

11:23.508 --> 11:27.082
individuals to obtain their passports and has generated

11:27.146 --> 11:30.062
$115,000 in that year.

11:30.196 --> 11:34.366
I'm extremely proud of our staff who has worked very hard to obtain their certification

11:34.478 --> 11:37.666
as passport agents and their dedication to the

11:37.688 --> 11:41.506
success of our program. Our program has been recognized by

11:41.528 --> 11:45.206
the US. Department of State for excellent customer service and

11:45.228 --> 11:49.078
for increasing the availability of this public service.

11:49.244 --> 11:53.270
Next slide. In order to better serve

11:53.690 --> 11:57.610
our other areas of our community, the Juvenile Case Manager Program

11:57.760 --> 12:01.126
expanded its Truancy prevention services to include

12:01.158 --> 12:04.666
the Aldine Independent School District this past year.

12:04.848 --> 12:08.582
Our Deferred Payment Program was recently recognized

12:08.646 --> 12:12.526
by the Government Collections Association of Texas as being the

12:12.548 --> 12:16.302
most innovative collection program for 2021.

12:16.436 --> 12:20.194
This program has a great team of dedicated staff who work very

12:20.232 --> 12:24.194
closely with individuals who need time to pay their fines and who

12:24.232 --> 12:27.038
track cases through the successful compliance.

12:27.214 --> 12:31.182
Court security remains at the forefront in our today's challenging

12:31.246 --> 12:35.026
environment. McD's Court Security Committee

12:35.138 --> 12:39.138
includes broad range of internal and external participants,

12:39.234 --> 12:42.242
and we meet monthly to discuss security related

12:42.306 --> 12:46.246
issues. Next slide, please. The major unmet

12:46.278 --> 12:49.466
need for MCD is the

12:49.488 --> 12:52.886
replacement of our central facility. We suffered

12:52.918 --> 12:57.020
major damage from Hurricane Harvey almost five years ago.

12:57.410 --> 13:01.102
Our court staff has been extremely flexible and

13:01.156 --> 13:04.394
several workarounds have been implemented, including doubling

13:04.442 --> 13:08.426
up in courts, doubling up in offices, sharing workspaces,

13:08.538 --> 13:12.078
and dealing with additional flooding and infrastructure

13:12.254 --> 13:16.098
failures as they arise and occur throughout the building.

13:16.264 --> 13:19.950
We are currently working very closely with the Mayor, GSD,

13:20.030 --> 13:23.366
Finance and FEMA to find a permanent solution for

13:23.388 --> 13:27.314
this ongoing facility replacement project. Next slide,

13:27.362 --> 13:30.886
please. This concludes the presentation of our

13:30.908 --> 13:34.466
FY 23 budget. Just wanted to thank my entire court

13:34.498 --> 13:37.734
team. They have been resilient and positive throughout this

13:37.772 --> 13:41.734
entire five years, doing the things that were necessary to keep the courts

13:41.782 --> 13:44.950
up, to keep the courts running, to keep the courts operational,

13:45.110 --> 13:48.394
and they have been doing an excellent job. And I would also

13:48.432 --> 13:51.914
like to thank the mayor, all of you council members for your continued

13:51.962 --> 13:54.714
support and my partner departments as GSD.

13:54.842 --> 13:58.110
Sometimes they let me knock out a wall, sometimes they won't.

13:58.530 --> 14:02.602
But we have done everything we can to keep the courts at the central location

14:02.666 --> 14:06.370
up and running for our citizens of Houston. And at this time, I welcome

14:06.440 --> 14:10.750
any questions you have. Thank you. Judge, do you have any insight

14:10.830 --> 14:15.094
on our site and release initiative? How many cases come

14:15.132 --> 14:17.800
to courts based on the site and release program?

14:18.490 --> 14:20.440
Site and release? Yes.

14:23.210 --> 14:27.222
They never come to municipal court for Class C misdemeanors?

14:27.286 --> 14:29.820
No, sir. Okay.

14:30.670 --> 14:34.326
All right. What about the associate judges positions?

14:34.358 --> 14:38.022
Have we filled those or how are we looking for the Associate

14:38.086 --> 14:41.678
municipal court judges? We are still going through the

14:41.684 --> 14:45.786
boards of commission to see who is applying. To date, we really don't

14:45.818 --> 14:49.386
have very many applicants because we are looking for more applicants

14:49.418 --> 14:52.994
for the Associate Judge position. I think I

14:53.032 --> 14:56.226
have contacted Jackie and the

14:56.248 --> 14:59.534
newest person there who took Maria's place, and we're

14:59.582 --> 15:03.140
still trying to get applicants in. If you could send

15:03.910 --> 15:07.794
additional information to my office again like you all did earlier

15:07.842 --> 15:11.286
in the year so we can reach out to our networks to see if

15:11.308 --> 15:16.518
we can get some people to apply, we'll do great council

15:16.534 --> 15:19.610
Member Abby Cayman. Thank you, Vice Chair.

15:20.430 --> 15:23.866
Judge, I think you've spotlighted all of the

15:23.888 --> 15:27.614
challenges that the municipal courts continue to face, again,

15:27.652 --> 15:30.190
distinct from criminal and civil.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.958
But going back to the accomplishments you listed, I know when

15:34.964 --> 15:38.634
we've been talking at Public Safety Committee night court,

15:38.762 --> 15:40.030
team court,

15:42.070 --> 15:45.954
all of the different efforts to meet people where

15:45.992 --> 15:50.354
they are, make sure they aren't unduly penalized and

15:50.392 --> 15:53.954
do right by them and do right by the city and law enforcement.

15:54.002 --> 15:58.614
Right. So I just want to give you all credit for that really

15:58.652 --> 16:01.560
quickly on the building, because you mentioned that.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.540
Talk to us about some of those challenges, if you can. Again,

16:06.990 --> 16:10.550
we are still dealing with the impacts of Harvey

16:10.710 --> 16:13.882
COVID, the structural damage. But what is that doing

16:13.936 --> 16:17.706
to the court process? The ability to function day to

16:17.728 --> 16:21.246
day. When Harvey hit, it wiped out the

16:21.268 --> 16:24.574
entire basement, as everybody knows. And we had six

16:24.612 --> 16:27.962
courts, I think, in operation. We had a bonding section,

16:28.026 --> 16:31.726
parking section, the bailiffs, we had different offices there.

16:31.828 --> 16:34.960
So all of those offices had to move

16:35.570 --> 16:39.162
somewhere. And the only court we had on the first floor

16:39.226 --> 16:43.320
was one court. And we have all of the cashiers and

16:43.770 --> 16:47.266
their departments there. The second floor had courtrooms.

16:47.378 --> 16:50.822
And so we have staff that we have

16:50.876 --> 16:55.500
renovated closets to put supervisors in.

16:57.630 --> 17:01.030
We have judges that are doubling up with courts and court dockets.

17:01.110 --> 17:05.914
We have done everything we could to maintain the

17:05.952 --> 17:09.450
atmosphere of a court that's friendly and safe for everyone.

17:09.600 --> 17:13.642
And then came COVID. And with COVID you can't

17:13.706 --> 17:17.134
stand close to each other. So it took the limited amount

17:17.172 --> 17:20.494
of space we had in the courtroom and cut it in half.

17:20.692 --> 17:24.594
And so that's how we have been operating now,

17:24.712 --> 17:28.274
but we're opening back up into sitting next to each other.

17:28.312 --> 17:31.486
But I have been mandated by the Supreme Court

17:31.518 --> 17:35.454
and I've given the authority to have everyone wear a mask

17:35.502 --> 17:38.694
because we see 2000, 3000 people a day. I just

17:38.732 --> 17:42.294
think it's safer that way for the employees. And I appreciate that

17:42.332 --> 17:46.186
because more shutdowns are going to create a further backlog. So I

17:46.208 --> 17:49.340
completely get that really quickly.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.500
In terms of other needs, concerns for the future,

17:54.270 --> 17:59.002
talk to me about truancy prevention and how that's going. Our truancy

17:59.146 --> 18:02.846
prevention is basically we have

18:02.868 --> 18:06.382
a fund from we have grant funding and we started out

18:06.436 --> 18:11.410
with grant funding that was around the $700,000

18:11.480 --> 18:15.102
range. We have seven juvenile case managers that operate

18:15.166 --> 18:19.502
under that grant. We have now submitted

18:19.646 --> 18:23.090
a request for additional grants and right now

18:23.160 --> 18:26.990
it's pending approval temporarily.

18:27.070 --> 18:31.398
They're saying that we may get 100,000. If we just get 100,000.

18:31.564 --> 18:34.966
There may be some other options we have to have to go to do so.

18:34.988 --> 18:38.554
That is an unmet need because for the school district to

18:38.592 --> 18:42.426
have juvenile case managers in there who know the

18:42.448 --> 18:45.946
kids if they come to teen court, the defendants who come to

18:45.968 --> 18:49.450
teen court, chances are a juvenile case manager

18:49.530 --> 18:53.440
knows that kid. And if we have to cut it,

18:53.890 --> 18:57.550
it's going to be a disservice, I think, to our youth.

18:57.890 --> 19:02.018
I just received word on the way yesterday to

19:02.104 --> 19:05.298
Teen Court's final thing that I do believe.

19:05.464 --> 19:09.060
I don't know if he is my first, but one of the first

19:09.510 --> 19:13.018
juveniles student volunteers that came through Teen

19:13.054 --> 19:16.326
Court is about to graduate from the University of Houston's Law

19:16.348 --> 19:18.840
School. So I was very proud of that.

19:19.290 --> 19:22.150
But if the Juvenile case managers,

19:23.450 --> 19:26.886
if we have enough money to keep what

19:26.908 --> 19:30.154
we have, we can work. But I'm not really sure we're going to be able

19:30.192 --> 19:33.430
to keep what we have with just that amount of grant funding.

19:33.510 --> 19:36.746
So are you saying that we may lose the 700,000 that

19:36.768 --> 19:40.762
we currently have? 700,000 is what they started

19:40.816 --> 19:45.566
off giving us. Then we went down to 500 and

19:45.588 --> 19:48.000
now the proposed is 125,

19:49.250 --> 19:53.060
I think you're saying is the Truancy program as is cannot continue.

19:53.750 --> 19:57.314
We have seven JCMS that are funded there. We may be able

19:57.352 --> 19:59.890
to fund three, but four we may lose.

20:00.230 --> 20:03.000
If you could keep us apprised of that,

20:03.770 --> 20:05.800
I would very much appreciate that.

20:09.550 --> 20:12.966
Council Member David Robinson. Thank you, Chair judge

20:12.998 --> 20:17.758
Marshall, thank you for being here. In your final page

20:17.844 --> 20:21.418
of your final slide of your appendix

20:21.514 --> 20:24.560
and your final bullet on that final page,

20:24.930 --> 20:28.746
you asked a mouthful, stating, in partnership

20:28.778 --> 20:32.338
with the Mayor's office, Finance, GSD and FEMA, we continue to

20:32.344 --> 20:36.078
seek an agreeable option for the replacement of the Central Court facility.

20:36.174 --> 20:37.940
Do you have anything to add to that,

20:39.750 --> 20:43.000
please, council members?

20:43.370 --> 20:46.280
Can we get your support as well? You have my support.

20:48.090 --> 20:51.926
I think our hands are basically tied by FEMA right

20:51.948 --> 20:55.080
now. For them to say, yes,

20:55.450 --> 20:58.566
we'll give you this funding, or no, we won't give you this funding,

20:58.598 --> 21:01.962
or yes, we're giving you some. And it has been

21:02.016 --> 21:05.498
like so there are some plans out there,

21:05.584 --> 21:08.974
Judge, as you know. And I guess what I'm asking you is

21:09.012 --> 21:12.670
if you have anything more to add and it sounds like we're in a pattern.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.520
Okay, thank you very much.

21:18.530 --> 21:22.062
Thank you, Judge, and Miss Santos for your presentations.

21:22.206 --> 21:25.860
And you are dismissed. Thank you. Thank you.

21:31.350 --> 21:34.534
And also thank you to your entire staff, your whole team back there,

21:34.572 --> 21:37.846
everyone who's in the chambers and not here. Thank you all for everything you do

21:37.868 --> 21:38.600
as well.

21:45.450 --> 21:48.454
We will now move into the public comment period.

21:48.582 --> 21:52.006
I will start with the virtual speakers. Please press star six to unmute

21:52.038 --> 21:54.806
when you hear your name. The first speaker is Ms.

21:54.838 --> 21:56.330
Saba Blanding.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.646
Hey, good afternoon again. I had

22:01.668 --> 22:05.470
a couple of questions. The first is, is there a plan

22:05.540 --> 22:09.374
to extend and expand the Safe Harbor Court from

22:09.412 --> 22:13.170
a public safety presentation? Last year, we had processed around

22:13.320 --> 22:16.862
1000 with 500,000 cases outstanding.

22:17.006 --> 22:21.330
How many people have been served in comparison to the eligible population?

22:21.990 --> 22:25.506
And then my second question is in regards

22:25.538 --> 22:29.062
to the truancy prevention initiatives. I'm curious what

22:29.116 --> 22:32.962
organizations and departments are collaborating in truancy prevention

22:33.026 --> 22:36.582
initiatives. Are there others in the Houston ecosystem

22:36.646 --> 22:40.650
to engage for compassionate approaches to truancy prevention?

22:43.310 --> 22:47.486
So for great questions, the first one, we're going to take

22:47.508 --> 22:50.826
that question and get a response from you regarding

22:50.858 --> 22:54.218
the Safe Harbor courts. So please submit

22:54.234 --> 22:59.306
that in writing over to District E at district

22:59.338 --> 23:02.846
E at Houst Gov and we'll get back to you shortly.

23:03.038 --> 23:06.546
Your second question on the truancy. I know

23:06.568 --> 23:10.050
that my Brother's Keeper, as well as the Credible Messenger program

23:10.120 --> 23:13.766
that we initiated last year, are working in collaboration with

23:13.788 --> 23:16.520
the municipal courts on the truancy issues.

23:17.050 --> 23:21.474
They do collaborations with the wraparound service and college counselors

23:21.602 --> 23:25.594
at some of the high schools. So they

23:25.632 --> 23:29.286
are working in tandem with different stakeholders

23:29.318 --> 23:33.594
and community groups on enhancing that program and trying

23:33.632 --> 23:35.850
to make sure that it's beneficial for the youth.

23:38.290 --> 23:41.486
Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.720
Amanda she.

23:45.730 --> 23:49.798
Hi, thank you. It feels like a theme

23:49.914 --> 23:54.350
across a lot of these budget presentations,

23:54.430 --> 23:57.874
like from the Health Department, department of Neighborhoods, things like that,

23:57.912 --> 24:01.950
is we're losing a lot of budget

24:02.030 --> 24:05.202
in terms of support for the youth.

24:05.266 --> 24:08.520
And I think this is just a statement, really. It just

24:09.290 --> 24:13.430
feels like a really great loss in a time when

24:13.500 --> 24:17.450
there's already so much for the kids to overcome

24:18.590 --> 24:23.834
what was having lost a lot of support with

24:24.032 --> 24:27.982
the schools and things like that. Yeah, I just

24:28.036 --> 24:31.886
wanted to highlight that. Thank you for highlighting that. And also

24:31.988 --> 24:35.370
be mindful that outside of just the city of Houston,

24:35.530 --> 24:39.034
there are many nonprofits

24:39.082 --> 24:42.594
and different organizations with youth emphasis that we

24:42.632 --> 24:46.270
collaborate with all of our offices, kind of work with some of these neighborhood

24:46.350 --> 24:50.206
and after school program groups that are focused on youth

24:50.238 --> 24:53.906
engagement. And so although some of the funding may not be

24:53.928 --> 24:58.306
there through the city of Houston, there are still ways in which we partner

24:58.418 --> 25:02.514
with a lot of great agencies that are still doing similar wonderful

25:02.562 --> 25:05.994
work for the youth as well. The next

25:06.032 --> 25:08.010
speaker is Jason Oliver.

25:10.430 --> 25:14.586
I want to pick up where Amanda left off. I have

25:14.608 --> 25:17.978
worked closely with my brother's Keeper on initiatives, and it

25:17.984 --> 25:20.830
looks like we're set to lose it from the Health Department.

25:21.170 --> 25:24.862
And I remember looking at all those that were

25:24.916 --> 25:28.302
green, right, that were funded from the general fund,

25:28.356 --> 25:31.566
which was a small portion in comparison to the

25:31.588 --> 25:35.554
red that were not funded. So, yes, there are

25:35.592 --> 25:38.846
a lot of programs in the community and right and like private programs

25:38.878 --> 25:42.514
and such, but one of the important things that somebody has brought up

25:42.552 --> 25:45.926
before during these workshops is like the consistency when

25:45.948 --> 25:49.154
you have a city entity or a city agency

25:49.282 --> 25:53.026
that's putting these things forward. So I just really think it's

25:53.058 --> 25:56.886
important to be especially as we're talking about focusing

25:56.918 --> 26:00.854
on crime and a lot of this deals with youth and touches

26:00.982 --> 26:04.234
youth and it's hard to find programs and

26:04.272 --> 26:07.578
consistent programming for youth in many

26:07.664 --> 26:10.762
spaces and areas around the city that's in no way equitably

26:10.826 --> 26:14.880
distributed. So I just want to flag that and then

26:15.330 --> 26:18.698
I'm trying to figure out what's going on with Site and release.

26:18.794 --> 26:21.870
She said that it doesn't touch the municipal courts.

26:22.030 --> 26:26.082
I'm not a lawyer, so I don't understand why

26:26.136 --> 26:29.666
that is, but I was hoping that there would be some changes that have

26:29.688 --> 26:32.966
been made as a result of

26:33.068 --> 26:36.550
Site and Release adoption that we can see here in the municipal courts.

26:37.370 --> 26:41.298
Great questions. I too am involved

26:41.314 --> 26:45.446
with my Brother's Keeper program. I can tell you that that as

26:45.468 --> 26:48.242
you know, was started through the Obama administration.

26:48.306 --> 26:51.446
So many of the funds that came through for that initiative,

26:51.558 --> 26:55.098
not only for the City of Houston, but all around the country, were federal dollars

26:55.184 --> 26:58.462
that we find matching grants and then can also

26:58.516 --> 27:02.078
provide dollars through our Council District service funds for specific

27:02.164 --> 27:05.934
initiatives in our district. So that's always been a

27:05.972 --> 27:09.440
program that we relied on for outside dollars.

27:09.830 --> 27:14.046
When it comes to the neighborhood programs

27:14.078 --> 27:17.620
and nonprofits regarding the youth, many times

27:18.390 --> 27:21.618
through my experience, they actually do

27:21.704 --> 27:25.542
a much better job of being

27:25.596 --> 27:27.720
consistent with the youth that they see.

27:28.250 --> 27:32.630
They're right there in those neighborhoods, in those schools, so they understand the dynamics

27:33.450 --> 27:36.946
of each of those communities. And many times for the city,

27:36.988 --> 27:40.474
we rely on partnering with them because they

27:40.512 --> 27:44.314
have more of a boots on the ground and wider perspective on what are

27:44.352 --> 27:47.862
the specific needs for those kids and those programs.

27:47.926 --> 27:51.822
And so although the City of Houston may not put

27:51.876 --> 27:55.166
forth some of those programs, we definitely try to support in as

27:55.188 --> 27:58.602
many ways as possible many of our offices

27:58.746 --> 28:02.830
allocate dollars towards the Case for Kids program with Harris County,

28:02.990 --> 28:06.222
which does tremendous work for after school programming

28:06.366 --> 28:11.006
and extracurricular activities for the youth. So we'll

28:11.038 --> 28:14.626
continue to do that. But if there are specific programs

28:14.658 --> 28:18.454
that you have highlighted or identified in the presentations that you think we

28:18.492 --> 28:21.750
need to allocate more resources towards,

28:21.820 --> 28:25.846
then of course, please let us know that as well and

28:25.868 --> 28:29.322
then we'll get an answer to you on the site and release, because I have

28:29.376 --> 28:32.906
similar questions. I was to the impression that since it was a

28:32.928 --> 28:36.122
citable offense that it would be at the municipal court level,

28:36.176 --> 28:39.898
but I may be wrong on that. So we're going to

28:39.904 --> 28:43.022
get some clarification and then we'll provide that feedback as well.

28:43.076 --> 28:46.394
So to ensure we get it to you in a prompt fashion,

28:46.442 --> 28:50.846
if you would email that directly to District E at houst gov

28:50.958 --> 28:56.794
and we'll get a response and

28:56.832 --> 29:00.842
that will complete our public Speakers for the

29:00.976 --> 29:03.210
Municipal Courts budget presentation.

29:06.770 --> 29:10.234
Before we adjourn, please note that budget workshops

29:25.080 --> 29:27.970
speak virtually on these topics.

29:28.710 --> 29:32.034

us. We learned from you, and we will get any answers that have
