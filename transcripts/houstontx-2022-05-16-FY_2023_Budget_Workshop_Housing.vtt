WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:03.806
We'll now adjourn for a second and begin our

00:03.828 --> 00:07.520
budget workshop on the Housing Department. Thank you.

00:30.490 --> 00:33.298
This time I'd like to welcome Director Keith Bottom and Ms.

00:33.314 --> 00:36.674
Tamika Jones to provide the Houston Housing

00:36.722 --> 00:39.590
Department budget presentation. Good afternoon.

00:39.750 --> 00:40.890
Good afternoon.

00:44.270 --> 00:48.438
Joining me today is my assistant director and Chief

00:48.454 --> 00:52.206
Financial Officer, Ms. Tamika Jones. If we

00:52.228 --> 00:54.030
go through the next slide,

00:56.770 --> 01:00.366
we are a department of acronyms. So here's a list of all

01:00.388 --> 01:04.002
the acronyms that we use. So we just wanted to provide

01:04.056 --> 01:06.740
you with that. If you go to the next slide, please.

01:12.470 --> 01:16.166
For the General Fund, we are probably the smallest budget you

01:16.188 --> 01:19.826
will see. At this budget hearing. We are projected

01:19.858 --> 01:24.626
to get $411,604 representing

01:24.818 --> 01:28.966
FTEs of 0.3. That 0.3 is represented

01:28.998 --> 01:32.314
by personnel. And you'll see

01:32.352 --> 01:37.162
the FY 23 budget of 135,493,

01:37.296 --> 01:40.574
which is the three which is part of

01:40.612 --> 01:44.746
my salary as well as employee exit costs,

01:44.778 --> 01:48.282
as benefit termination pay and workers

01:48.346 --> 01:51.594
compensation. And then the other side of that chart,

01:51.642 --> 01:55.514
you'll see the other services and charges which represent

01:55.642 --> 01:59.890
$276,111

01:59.960 --> 02:03.678
which covers janitorial, rent and other miscellaneous

02:03.774 --> 02:05.990
chargebacks. Next slide.

02:12.010 --> 02:13.750
Let me get a little closer.

02:14.970 --> 02:18.140
All right. Is that better? All right. Thank you.

02:18.910 --> 02:22.854
If you go to that slide, you'll see all of department programming.

02:22.902 --> 02:26.602
You'll see single family home repair and

02:26.656 --> 02:29.750
reconstruction. Single family new construction,

02:29.910 --> 02:32.826
home buyer assistance and home buyer choice.

02:33.018 --> 02:37.102
Multifamily programs, public facilities and

02:37.156 --> 02:40.110
public services. Next slide.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.762
Our general fund revenue overview. You'll see on

02:45.816 --> 02:49.602
General Fund from FY 21, we were just under

02:49.736 --> 02:53.650
half million. And now in FY 23,

02:53.800 --> 02:58.214
we're at 411 six four from

02:58.252 --> 03:02.502
the previous year. That's a reduction of $6,114,

03:02.556 --> 03:06.310
a 1.4% reduction.

03:06.650 --> 03:10.282
Next slide, expenditures by

03:10.336 --> 03:14.022
category. You will see on the expenditures

03:14.086 --> 03:17.722
and we can go by those. And in purpose of

03:17.776 --> 03:20.654
saving time, we'll just look at FY 23,

03:20.772 --> 03:24.830
the proposed It's 135 493

03:24.900 --> 03:29.338
for personnel, 160 for office rent,

03:29.514 --> 03:33.630
99,084 for restricted accounts

03:33.710 --> 03:38.130
and then other services and charges just over 17,000

03:38.200 --> 03:43.060
for a total again of 411,604.

03:43.750 --> 03:47.426
The next slide is our personnel versus non

03:47.458 --> 03:51.990
personnel. And you will see here that personnel

03:52.810 --> 03:56.982
relates to 33%. Non personnel is 67%

03:57.116 --> 04:00.090
of those dollars. Next slide.

04:01.390 --> 04:04.730
Our general fund budget expenditures. Again,

04:04.800 --> 04:08.122
in order to save a little time,

04:08.256 --> 04:15.066
you can see that previous year we were 417,718

04:15.258 --> 04:19.690
compared to the current proposed of 411

04:19.770 --> 04:23.698
604. Again a 1.46%

04:23.784 --> 04:26.370
reduction. Next slide.

04:28.150 --> 04:31.186
And the next one on this one

04:31.208 --> 04:34.450
is our organization chart. So you can see the

04:34.520 --> 04:38.086
current organization. To the right, you will see

04:38.188 --> 04:42.854
all of the people who report directly to me. And as

04:42.892 --> 04:47.314
of today, we can add an additional person. Kanesha London

04:47.362 --> 04:50.966
is now my new assistant Director in charge

04:50.998 --> 04:54.346
of Compliance. But that chart to

04:54.368 --> 04:58.202
the left is the chart that represents individual

04:58.336 --> 05:02.762
departments who receive funding and represent employees

05:02.826 --> 05:06.766
in those other departments which total to 88

05:06.948 --> 05:10.800
employees that are funded through us,

05:12.850 --> 05:16.354
along with our 266 employees for

05:16.392 --> 05:20.130
a total of 354 employees.

05:20.630 --> 05:24.066
Next chart. And that chart just gives you some of the

05:24.088 --> 05:27.686
demographics. Let you know that the

05:27.708 --> 05:31.186
department is 39% male, 61% female,

05:31.298 --> 05:34.470
and then the ethnic breakdown of the department.

05:35.690 --> 05:39.702
Next slide our

05:39.756 --> 05:43.642
FY 2023 new awards. This is a breakdown of

05:43.696 --> 05:47.286
the anticipated funding that we will be receiving.

05:47.318 --> 05:51.162
And you can see CDBG. Turs HOPWA

05:51.226 --> 05:55.502
home Emergency shelter. Grant Our State

05:55.556 --> 05:59.550
Homeless Housing Fund and general fund

05:59.620 --> 06:03.310
add up to just over $62 million.

06:03.380 --> 06:07.154
And then you can see the chart. To the right is a breakdown of 40%.

06:07.192 --> 06:11.102
Of that funding is CDBG 18% Hopper,

06:11.166 --> 06:14.526
17% home, 19% Turs,

06:14.638 --> 06:17.894
3% ESG, and then

06:17.932 --> 06:21.766
the Texas Housing bond money is 2%.

06:21.948 --> 06:25.366
And then the general fund dollar is

06:25.548 --> 06:27.240
zero point 66%.

06:28.810 --> 06:32.406
And that is our presentation. Thank you, Director.

06:32.438 --> 06:35.978
And people may be sitting here saying, why do we even do a budget for

06:35.984 --> 06:39.574
a department that has balance or revenue

06:39.622 --> 06:43.422
stream, expense stream of $411,000?

06:43.556 --> 06:46.654
It's because of that last slide. It's because of the flow through.

06:46.772 --> 06:50.394
It's because of all the money that goes from agencies,

06:50.442 --> 06:54.414
whether it's the federal government Glo into your department and

06:54.452 --> 06:58.546
then out. It gives us the opportunity to ask questions of you,

06:58.648 --> 07:02.786
because last time we saw you both together, it wasn't a pretty picture we were

07:02.808 --> 07:06.674
looking at. So I guess my initial question is how

07:06.712 --> 07:10.534
is that going on the Glo side? Because we still are hearing from

07:10.572 --> 07:13.426
residents that even though this is a budget workshop,

07:13.458 --> 07:17.286
411,000 isn't a lot. But at

07:17.308 --> 07:22.074
the same time, I'd like to just get a quick status update on how

07:22.112 --> 07:25.962
things are going, how can we help your department move

07:26.016 --> 07:28.300
things forward and what do we need to do?

07:28.670 --> 07:32.174
So the gist of it is,

07:32.292 --> 07:35.742
the last time we were in front of this committee, that was just

07:35.796 --> 07:39.694
after September 21, when all things changed in our

07:39.732 --> 07:43.410
department. Since then and at that point when we met,

07:43.480 --> 07:46.626
we were having some significant challenges with

07:46.648 --> 07:50.514
the Glo. Some of those challenges have not totally gone

07:50.552 --> 07:54.334
away, but we have a more workable relationship with the Glo

07:54.382 --> 07:57.190
now. We've made some significant progress.

07:57.930 --> 08:01.046
Many of the programs that they put on hold are

08:01.068 --> 08:04.680
now starting to be released and we're moving forward.

08:05.210 --> 08:08.814
Our single family program that the Glo

08:08.882 --> 08:12.518
took back, the only part that the department

08:12.694 --> 08:16.522
kept was the pieces that were still in the pipeline. That program

08:16.576 --> 08:20.254
is now winding down and we anticipate that program will be

08:20.292 --> 08:24.218
completely wound down by mid to late summer.

08:24.394 --> 08:27.230
So we are making some significant improvements.

08:27.890 --> 08:31.198
The multifamily program, which has always

08:31.284 --> 08:35.266
been one of the carrots in

08:35.288 --> 08:38.180
our portfolio, has done extremely well.

08:38.550 --> 08:42.194
We have also had some challenges with the Glo in accepting and

08:42.232 --> 08:45.894
moving forward. We provided them with loads of information

08:46.012 --> 08:49.590
so we can start moving those programs forward.

08:49.740 --> 08:53.714
So overall, we have made some significant improvements.

08:53.842 --> 08:57.894
There are some things some of our programs have been slowed simply

08:57.942 --> 09:01.354
because of primarily the pandemic. Some of those

09:01.392 --> 09:05.814
changes are due to supply

09:05.862 --> 09:09.206
chain issues, a lack of inventory.

09:09.318 --> 09:12.240
We have a significant home down payment,

09:12.930 --> 09:15.870
first time Home Buyers Assistance Program.

09:16.020 --> 09:20.270
But the inventory is starting to dry up and it's very difficult

09:20.420 --> 09:23.746
to provide that housing when individuals can't find it.

09:23.848 --> 09:27.442
But we are making some significant improvements since

09:27.496 --> 09:30.930
the last time we've been here. Thank you. Council Member Abby Cayman.

09:32.310 --> 09:35.542
Thank you. And Director, I really want to congratulate you.

09:35.596 --> 09:39.378
You have always been with the department

09:39.554 --> 09:43.990
for your extended tenure, leading with such dignity,

09:44.490 --> 09:48.134
consistency, and diligence. So thank you

09:48.172 --> 09:51.900
and to your entire staff. I also really want to commend you all.

09:52.430 --> 09:55.754
We've been hearing around the Horseshoe how

09:55.792 --> 09:59.702
important especially, I want to say, with single family homes

09:59.766 --> 10:04.314
in that program and the rebuilding, the flexibility that we have afforded homeowners

10:04.442 --> 10:08.122
that other I will say state agencies

10:08.186 --> 10:11.726
have not afforded that flexibility in

10:11.748 --> 10:14.818
terms of rebuilds and things like that. And I think that's a really big success

10:14.904 --> 10:18.066
story that we are seeing on the ground here. We just did a

10:18.088 --> 10:22.066
groundbreaking halfway kind

10:22.088 --> 10:25.886
of checkbox on some multifamily

10:25.918 --> 10:29.302
housing in the district that we're seeing in real time

10:29.356 --> 10:33.474
all of the progress that we're making. I'm a little concerned,

10:33.602 --> 10:37.110
just as we're seeing and Mayor Pro TEM talked about this,

10:37.180 --> 10:40.806
the housing market, the affordability of housing

10:40.918 --> 10:43.990
right now. And with you saying about that inventory

10:44.070 --> 10:47.210
drying up in terms of single family home availability,

10:47.550 --> 10:52.154
a little concerned about that. And we'll submit some questions through

10:52.192 --> 10:55.742
the portal, but I appreciate you raising that. My one question is,

10:55.796 --> 10:59.034
given the constraints that we have as a city financially,

10:59.082 --> 11:02.574
and I'm asking every department this, what are the needs that are

11:02.612 --> 11:06.226
currently not being addressed that you foresee can be a challenge for

11:06.248 --> 11:09.940
the city either near term or down the road?

11:10.470 --> 11:13.902
Well, I think the biggest need is perhaps

11:14.046 --> 11:17.800
asking for additional or more money coming from general fund.

11:18.490 --> 11:22.614
All of the dollars that we typically use or have available are

11:22.652 --> 11:25.880
going to be tied to the federal government,

11:26.330 --> 11:30.286
except for the tourist money. But the tourist money is already predetermined

11:30.338 --> 11:34.474
what we're going to do with that in most cases. But we

11:34.512 --> 11:38.266
have a tremendous amount of need in

11:38.288 --> 11:42.122
the city when it comes to individuals who need their home repaired.

11:42.266 --> 11:45.726
And because of some of the restrictions that

11:45.748 --> 11:49.182
come with the federal dollar, it becomes very

11:49.236 --> 11:52.990
difficult to assist individuals who are not homeowners.

11:54.070 --> 11:57.134
I am a little bit challenged with trying to assist

11:57.182 --> 12:00.562
just renters in general, because we don't want to

12:00.696 --> 12:04.622
enhance a property that they don't control. And we enhance

12:04.686 --> 12:08.310
that property, then the property owner comes back and either

12:08.380 --> 12:11.766
increases their rent or even

12:11.868 --> 12:15.174
worst case scenario, puts them out in order to get more

12:15.212 --> 12:18.522
value for that property. So it becomes very challenging to

12:18.576 --> 12:22.550
assist renters, but we also find ourselves

12:22.630 --> 12:25.974
finding it being very challenging assisting

12:26.022 --> 12:29.834
individuals who can't meet all of the needs, even though they may

12:29.872 --> 12:33.738
be the homeowner, but they don't have everything in place to prove that they're

12:33.754 --> 12:37.694
the homeowner. So they've been in the home for a number of years,

12:37.812 --> 12:42.058
may have been awarded the home through someone's passing,

12:42.234 --> 12:45.698
but they didn't do all of the things necessary to

12:45.864 --> 12:50.286
put the property in their name. So they still technically cannot

12:50.318 --> 12:53.998
prove that they are the homeowner. So it becomes very challenging when you're

12:54.014 --> 12:56.850
trying to use federal dollars to assist those individuals.

12:56.930 --> 13:00.934
That's why it would be better if we had additional general fund dollars

13:01.052 --> 13:02.710
that would be more flexible.

13:05.050 --> 13:08.662
Thank you. We have about ten public

13:08.716 --> 13:11.818
speakers that signed up, so we'll go through the list real quick.

13:11.984 --> 13:15.626
The first we have is Mr. Christopher Rivera, who is

13:15.648 --> 13:18.970
joining us virtually. Christopher star six to unmute.

13:19.870 --> 13:23.530
Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Great.

13:23.600 --> 13:27.466
Thank you. Housing programs becoming increasingly

13:27.498 --> 13:31.166
important due to the rising costs of living. This year, the Housing and

13:31.188 --> 13:34.758
Community Development Department will only receive 0.1% of the city's

13:34.794 --> 13:38.366
general budget. Local reports indicate rent

13:38.398 --> 13:42.514
has gone up 22% in Houston, and just last week there were 783

13:42.552 --> 13:46.242
Evictions filed. We are facing a housing crisis, and the city

13:46.296 --> 13:49.814
continues to cut funding that keeps our community safe. In the last

13:49.852 --> 13:53.000
ten years, the housing budget has decreased by 82%.

13:53.610 --> 13:57.174
The city of Houston is only one federal budget cut away from

13:57.212 --> 14:00.406
a housing program disaster, an impact that will be felt

14:00.438 --> 14:04.490
by low income families who will lose everything. My questions

14:04.560 --> 14:08.186
are, how will the Housing and Community Development Department work to

14:08.208 --> 14:11.322
secure a self sufficient budget, one that moves away from

14:11.376 --> 14:15.134
reliance on federal funds? Why has

14:15.172 --> 14:19.262
the funding for the Housing Department decreased by 83% in the last ten years?

14:19.396 --> 14:23.230
And why does this department rely so heavily on federal grants?

14:23.390 --> 14:27.074
Thank you. I didn't hear the last question. Why are

14:27.112 --> 14:30.530
we dependent upon federal grants? Was his last comment.

14:32.230 --> 14:35.606
The city of Houston is an entitlement city. We get the

14:35.628 --> 14:38.822
majority of our funding does come from the federal government.

14:38.956 --> 14:41.590
Majority of that funding is coming from HUD.

14:42.730 --> 14:46.706
We get funding through a number of programs,

14:46.738 --> 14:50.454
through HUD CDBG, which is our normal

14:50.502 --> 14:55.370
funding source. We also have home. We also have ESG

14:55.790 --> 14:59.226
programming. That has always been the way the

14:59.248 --> 15:02.206
department has been set up and the way the city has been set up to

15:02.228 --> 15:06.026
receive funding from HUD. The dollar

15:06.058 --> 15:09.406
amount that we receive is based on a formula that has been

15:09.428 --> 15:13.078
preset. That formula was designed

15:13.114 --> 15:15.794
in the late 60s, early 70s.

15:15.912 --> 15:19.154
That number has been the same, and we have not been

15:19.192 --> 15:23.026
able to get her to deviate from

15:23.208 --> 15:26.562
the current formula. Even though we are growing in size

15:26.616 --> 15:32.306
and have grown in size since the original formula

15:32.338 --> 15:35.926
was created, it has not adjusted anywhere in the country.

15:36.108 --> 15:39.882
And there are some cities who are not as large as us receive much

15:39.936 --> 15:44.042
more funding than we do. But it was based on the formula and amount of

15:44.176 --> 15:47.100
need that those cities had at that time.

15:48.030 --> 15:52.314
We've inquired, we've asked, but the formula

15:52.362 --> 15:54.030
has not yet been changed.

15:55.970 --> 15:59.438
I don't have a really good answer about

15:59.524 --> 16:02.974
how to get

16:03.012 --> 16:07.230
an increase in funding from the city. We can ask for additional

16:07.310 --> 16:11.154
general fund dollar, but that is a budget issue. That is

16:11.192 --> 16:13.220
always going to be a budget issue.

16:15.750 --> 16:19.382
Sorry, go ahead. When it comes to

16:19.436 --> 16:23.058
assisting individuals that were facing eviction,

16:23.154 --> 16:28.186
we are currently dealing with some funding that we did have that

16:28.208 --> 16:31.974
is dealing with individuals who are in the midst of being evicted

16:32.022 --> 16:35.514
at the present time. Great.

16:35.552 --> 16:38.778
Thank you. In person,

16:38.864 --> 16:40.330
Mr. Jason oliver.

16:48.770 --> 16:52.666
Hi director bynum thank you for your presentation.

16:52.858 --> 16:56.786
First, I noticed, and there was a recent county report

16:56.968 --> 17:01.102
that basically showed that we have almost none of the necessary

17:01.166 --> 17:04.462
supply for what's described as extremely low income,

17:04.606 --> 17:08.722
zero to 30% median household income housing.

17:08.866 --> 17:13.640
Is the department set up to even shift that

17:15.930 --> 17:17.640
severe need at all?

17:19.050 --> 17:21.020
Yeah, that's my first question.

17:23.230 --> 17:26.554
I missed the beginning of your question where you said you

17:26.592 --> 17:29.514
saw the statistics that came that said what?

17:29.712 --> 17:32.926
So there is a severe shortage in the

17:32.948 --> 17:36.430
supply for extremely low income, like zero to 30%

17:36.500 --> 17:39.070
median household income housing,

17:39.570 --> 17:43.566
and we're just in no way equipped to provide to

17:43.588 --> 17:46.578
meet that need and that demand in the near future.

17:46.744 --> 17:50.546
Well, we are trying to meet the demand in a

17:50.568 --> 17:54.290
number of ways. It's very difficult in single family

17:54.360 --> 17:57.874
ownership. We do try to do a better job in

17:57.912 --> 18:01.462
trying to meet it in the rental market. So we are trying

18:01.516 --> 18:05.062
to provide that in a number of opportunities by

18:05.116 --> 18:08.694
preventing or asking all of our developers to look

18:08.732 --> 18:13.062
at an array of income

18:13.126 --> 18:17.094
structures so we can provide rental

18:17.142 --> 18:20.666
units for all of the streams of income in

18:20.688 --> 18:24.858
the city. It is very difficult because there is a large pool

18:25.034 --> 18:28.366
in that group versus the number of units that we can put

18:28.388 --> 18:31.774
on the market. Okay. And then this

18:31.812 --> 18:35.662
is, I guess, a question for council, because you've come here saying

18:35.716 --> 18:39.774
that you need the time has expired, which council members are supportive

18:39.822 --> 18:43.662
of an amendment to allocate more general funds for the housing department

18:43.726 --> 18:46.498
so that you can address the issues that you talked about before.

18:46.664 --> 18:50.870
Thank you. Thank you. Baba Blandy.

18:54.970 --> 18:59.558
Hi, good afternoon. I'll start by reiterating Jason's questions and

18:59.724 --> 19:03.526
use my time to answer that. And I also want to follow up on Christopher's

19:03.558 --> 19:07.258
question. And a lot of times I've come up

19:07.264 --> 19:10.890
here and asked, like, what could you do with more? But I'm actually curious.

19:11.310 --> 19:15.098
It was very shocking to me that in ten years,

19:15.184 --> 19:18.782
your budget has dropped by 83%. You went from almost

19:18.836 --> 19:22.286
2.5. The next year was like, 1.4, and then

19:22.308 --> 19:25.694
it dropped to like, 677. And then even in the past seven years,

19:25.732 --> 19:29.474
it's been reduced by 38%. And I'm just curious, how has this

19:29.512 --> 19:33.090
impacted you all's ability to provide for the city of Houston?

19:35.190 --> 19:38.626
I know, like, what can we do to increase the housing department resources to meet

19:38.648 --> 19:41.499
the needs. I know you've mentioned increasing the general fund budget, so I'm going to

19:41.999 --> 19:45.702
circle that back to Jason's question. What council members are open

19:45.756 --> 19:51.034
to a budget amendment to give our city what we need? Because you

19:51.072 --> 19:54.822
don't need to be here 2 seconds before you see how many people are unhoused.

19:54.886 --> 19:58.314
And we know how insane the housing market is

19:58.352 --> 19:58.940
here.

20:01.310 --> 20:04.766
So, Director, isn't it true that

20:04.948 --> 20:08.414
we have additional dollars that your department utilizes for

20:08.452 --> 20:11.066
housing that's outside of just the general budget,

20:11.178 --> 20:14.882
federal dollars, state dollars, grant dollars that are just

20:14.936 --> 20:18.466
not encompassed in your presentation today?

20:18.648 --> 20:21.934
That is correct. We would also have access to the tourist

20:21.982 --> 20:25.060
dollars. And the tourist dollars are

20:26.650 --> 20:30.514
designed to help with the development of affordable

20:30.562 --> 20:33.560
housing. Can we go back to slide twelve?

20:38.140 --> 20:41.804
Sorry, Council Member Pollard, is it okay if I just track real quick

20:41.842 --> 20:45.576
to what you asked? Well, let me get his response

20:45.608 --> 20:49.356
to this. I just want to clarify where all

20:49.378 --> 20:52.572
of the resources that

20:52.706 --> 20:55.968
your department is utilizing for housing needs within the

20:55.974 --> 20:59.872
city of Houston, and on page twelve, you have a breakdown here

21:00.006 --> 21:03.504
of different funding sources. Can you elaborate a little bit

21:03.542 --> 21:06.976
more on that? So you'll see on the breakdown on

21:06.998 --> 21:10.896
the housing sources, sure. Everyone realizes that the majority

21:10.928 --> 21:14.916
of our dollars come from CDBG funding. That's our largest pot of

21:14.938 --> 21:19.024
the pie, $25 million. And then you see Turs

21:19.072 --> 21:22.776
12 million, hopper is 10 million. And we can

21:22.798 --> 21:26.436
go on and on. What you are presenting

21:26.468 --> 21:30.088
today is just the general fund. That's all we're presenting today is

21:30.094 --> 21:33.256
a general fund piece of the budget. And your follow up?

21:33.358 --> 21:36.952
Well, Councilman Pollard, I understand those funding revenues,

21:37.016 --> 21:40.504
but what concerns me is that ten years ago, their general fund budget

21:40.552 --> 21:44.080
was almost $2.5 million. And it paid as our city

21:44.150 --> 21:48.320
grows and as our housing prices skyrocket,

21:49.140 --> 21:52.336
that our city budget is being reduced so

21:52.358 --> 21:55.664
drastically. But the question I would have,

21:55.702 --> 21:59.068
and we can get this from the department and then get it back out

21:59.094 --> 22:02.356
to the public, is how much money were we getting from

22:02.378 --> 22:05.636
outside sources as well to supplement? If we

22:05.658 --> 22:09.152
were at 2.5 million before, what were we getting in CDBG?

22:09.216 --> 22:13.128
What were we getting in Turs? Dollars. Because that plays a role also

22:13.294 --> 22:16.488
in, I think, how we allocate dollars from the general fund.

22:16.574 --> 22:19.604
So if you can work on that, Director,

22:19.652 --> 22:23.464
to show maybe ten years ago what

22:23.502 --> 22:27.132
was coming in from a funding standpoint from outside the city as

22:27.186 --> 22:30.716
compared to now, sure, we can get that information to you. Now,

22:30.738 --> 22:34.224
I can tell you, I've been in the department for 30 years. When I first

22:34.262 --> 22:37.616
got to the permanent CDBG, funding at that time for the

22:37.638 --> 22:40.050
city was over $60 million.

22:40.740 --> 22:43.920
But as they began to get additional

22:44.260 --> 22:48.276
municipalities join the group, as the

22:48.298 --> 22:51.636
need grew around the country, then the dollars,

22:51.738 --> 22:56.288
they're just limited dollars. So the dollars start coming down council

22:56.304 --> 22:59.700
Member Alcorn thank you, Chair. In other cities,

23:00.760 --> 23:04.200
do they operate in the same way with most of the money

23:04.270 --> 23:07.428
coming into their departments being from the federal sources?

23:07.524 --> 23:10.970
Our local dollars are of course the Tours dollars are coming into it.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.244
Or do other cities within Texas spend more

23:15.442 --> 23:16.910
general fund money?

23:18.400 --> 23:22.508
They tend to give their department a little bit more general fund dollars.

23:22.674 --> 23:25.872
We've seen cities outside of Texas who really

23:25.926 --> 23:29.264
do give a larger contribution from

23:29.302 --> 23:32.636
their general fund to the Housing department.

23:32.828 --> 23:36.820
Philadelphia stands out, los Angeles

23:37.560 --> 23:40.756
and a few others, I believe chicago, they tend to

23:40.858 --> 23:45.270
dedicate more general fund dollar to the department. Thank you.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.700
Council Member Thomas staff.

23:48.880 --> 23:49.610
Hi.

23:51.660 --> 23:54.936
So Council Member Thomas just wanted to express that we

23:54.958 --> 23:58.468
have an annual action plan that's outlined

23:58.484 --> 24:01.892
to support homelessness and all federal allocations.

24:02.036 --> 24:05.724
And in response to your question, the reduction of general fund money is

24:05.762 --> 24:09.276
because positions and programs were attached to federal money to leave the

24:09.298 --> 24:12.716
general fund. So that's her

24:12.738 --> 24:16.396
note. Thank you. Okay, I appreciate

24:16.428 --> 24:19.280
you all's time. Sakunda Joseph.

24:23.860 --> 24:27.164
Hello, I'm Sakonda Joseph. Like wakanda.

24:27.212 --> 24:29.940
But thank you for your presentation.

24:31.640 --> 24:34.948
I had other questions, but I just think it's an opportunity to

24:34.954 --> 24:38.436
make a statement is that I do want the council members here to

24:38.458 --> 24:41.544
know, which I know that you do that right now, the city

24:41.582 --> 24:45.560
of Houston is number one in evictions, number two in

24:45.710 --> 24:49.304
folks not having access to affordable housing. Many people

24:49.342 --> 24:52.928
who came, a few people who had came here earlier today were people who missed

24:52.964 --> 24:56.670
work, left early. Some people couldn't come because of work

24:57.440 --> 25:01.676
because they are in trouble. I get calls on my own phone

25:01.858 --> 25:05.260
about the evictions, and since February,

25:05.860 --> 25:09.424
I've been so stressed just as a human being

25:09.542 --> 25:12.816
here, living in this city that care about the people that

25:12.838 --> 25:16.336
are in this city, until I'm trying to figure out what it

25:16.358 --> 25:19.044
is that we can do to do better. So I don't want you all to

25:19.082 --> 25:22.484
look over what was said. If there's opportunity to

25:22.522 --> 25:26.020
if the budget has decreased over ten years,

25:26.170 --> 25:29.332
for what this? For what we can do,

25:29.466 --> 25:33.304
right? We understand. The federal stuff aside, I really hope

25:33.422 --> 25:36.920
that folks that are elected by the people take the time

25:36.990 --> 25:40.424
out, because I'm taking my time out to think about what

25:40.462 --> 25:44.076
we can do to increase the budget to make sure that a lot

25:44.098 --> 25:47.416
of our citizens are housed and have a safe

25:47.448 --> 25:49.870
place to say thank you. Thank you.

25:51.280 --> 26:08.376
Carrie Colleague I

26:08.398 --> 26:12.116
just want to thank you for your presentation and I'm

26:12.148 --> 26:15.400
just going to read my question. According to the Kinder Institute,

26:16.460 --> 26:19.996
evictions cost Harris County over 240,000,000 a

26:20.018 --> 26:23.336
year prior to the economic impacts of COVID-19.

26:23.528 --> 26:26.988
Harris county and the city of Houston are not direct

26:27.074 --> 26:31.212
comparisons, but there is a lot of overlap.

26:31.356 --> 26:34.876
And I want to know what does your department propose as solutions

26:34.908 --> 26:39.280
to address Houston's eviction crisis

26:40.020 --> 26:43.652
similar to what Sakanda said, we have a lot of people that are being

26:43.706 --> 26:50.404
evicted. And I know that you stated that you

26:50.442 --> 26:54.408
need more funds. So my ask

26:54.494 --> 26:59.880
is that City council would propose

27:01.100 --> 27:05.172
redistributing some of those funds to specifically

27:05.236 --> 27:08.830
housing so that we can address that situation.

27:09.200 --> 27:13.870
And then my second question would be okay,

27:15.280 --> 27:19.124
finish your second question really quick. It's just about repairs

27:19.192 --> 27:22.844
and just funding for single home repairs

27:22.892 --> 27:27.056
and rebuild. We have a lot of people that, even after

27:27.238 --> 27:31.680
Harvey, are still struggling to fix

27:31.750 --> 27:35.248
their homes. And although there are some programs

27:35.424 --> 27:39.684
I recently called as soon as a month ago, and my

27:39.722 --> 27:43.316
aunt specifically, they were told they had no funds in the

27:43.338 --> 27:46.170
city to help rebuild her home.

27:50.220 --> 27:54.232
Let me ask you your first question. In terms of the

27:54.286 --> 27:57.384
dollars that came into the city to assist

27:57.432 --> 28:01.390
individuals who were going through the eviction process.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.516
We were able to serve between it was a joint venture between us

28:05.538 --> 28:09.616
and the county. We were able to provide assistance to

28:09.798 --> 28:13.744
over 70,000 families and put

28:13.782 --> 28:18.368
out nearly $400 million

28:18.534 --> 28:21.410
in one year. We were able to do that,

28:22.600 --> 28:28.004
but the need was so much greater. Correct. And we

28:28.042 --> 28:31.716
just did not have any more dollars. We put out

28:31.738 --> 28:35.112
all the dollars that we had and the dollars that came

28:35.166 --> 28:38.810
in remaining that we got from

28:39.580 --> 28:43.716
areas that did not spend those dollars. We put that for individuals

28:43.748 --> 28:46.410
who were in eviction as we speak.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.764
So we eliminated rental assistance and

28:50.802 --> 28:54.076
went directly to individuals who were in the

28:54.098 --> 28:57.816
process of going through eviction as we speak. So that's

28:57.848 --> 29:01.740
where those dollars are, but we just don't have any additional

29:01.820 --> 29:05.536
now we've asked for additional funding. That funding just has

29:05.558 --> 29:08.992
not arrived. Thank you. And her second question,

29:09.046 --> 29:11.780
the second part of your question. When it comes to repair,

29:14.200 --> 29:17.844
again, the dollars are limited. We can only do what

29:17.882 --> 29:21.670
we can. It is a very difficult

29:22.440 --> 29:25.556
product in dealing with home repair.

29:25.748 --> 29:29.748
As I mentioned earlier, one of the major issues with dealing

29:29.764 --> 29:32.936
with home repair are the individuals who cannot prove that they are the

29:32.958 --> 29:36.516
owner. We have our hands tied

29:36.548 --> 29:40.456
with being able to provide assistance to individuals who are renting.

29:40.568 --> 29:43.948
So it is a very challenging process

29:44.034 --> 29:47.464
in getting those done. The difference between what we did versus

29:47.512 --> 29:51.392
what the Glo did was the Glo takes

29:51.446 --> 29:54.896
the list and if you're up next, if you're ready to go,

29:54.998 --> 29:58.704
then you get service. But if you're not ready

29:58.742 --> 30:02.008
to go, if you don't have title and you don't

30:02.044 --> 30:05.408
have all your ducks lined up in a row

30:05.504 --> 30:09.076
ready to receive assistance, then they move on. What the

30:09.098 --> 30:12.676
City of Houston approach is, we try not

30:12.698 --> 30:16.244
to leave anyone behind. So we have volunteer

30:16.292 --> 30:20.040
lawyers. We try to put everyone

30:20.190 --> 30:24.040
into a process that allows them to get a complete

30:24.110 --> 30:27.564
service. Not just are you ready to be

30:27.602 --> 30:31.132
served? If you don't comply today, then you just

30:31.186 --> 30:34.492
miss out. We're really trying to do everything we can

30:34.546 --> 30:38.780
to not leave anyone behind that becomes very challenging

30:39.140 --> 30:41.900
and it does become very time consuming.

30:42.060 --> 30:45.330
And we're doing that with limited dollars. Thank you.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.680
Julia ardua.

31:03.410 --> 31:06.594
Thank you, sir, for your presentation. I also want to say

31:06.632 --> 31:10.770
I stand in solidarity with all five people that spoke before

31:10.840 --> 31:14.580
me. I'd like to ask which council members

31:15.030 --> 31:19.142
are supportive of an amendment during

31:19.196 --> 31:23.014
this cycle to allocate more general funds to

31:23.052 --> 31:26.982
housing? I think that's really

31:27.036 --> 31:30.230
important then to you, sir. I'd like to ask,

31:30.300 --> 31:33.850
has the department examined eviction rights to council

31:34.430 --> 31:38.122
programs as seen in other cities? If so, what would be

31:38.176 --> 31:42.294
the cost to provide that legal representation to histonians

31:42.342 --> 31:45.466
facing eviction? Could you repeat

31:45.498 --> 31:49.146
that question? Yes, sir. I'll take my mask

31:49.178 --> 31:53.306
up. Has the department examined eviction rights

31:53.338 --> 31:56.930
to council programs as seen in other cities?

31:57.670 --> 32:01.746
If so, what would be the cost to

32:01.768 --> 32:05.454
provide that legal representation to Houstonians facing

32:05.502 --> 32:09.314
eviction? We have not looked at what other cities

32:09.362 --> 32:12.914
are doing, but we are providing legal services to individuals

32:12.962 --> 32:16.646
now. Okay. And is there a cost to

32:16.668 --> 32:20.958
those citizens? There is no cost to those citizens. We're footing

32:20.994 --> 32:23.340
that cost. Okay. Thank you, sir.

32:24.350 --> 32:26.010
Broderick Butler.

32:42.510 --> 32:46.346
Director, thank you very much for your presentation. Again,

32:46.448 --> 32:50.522
I apologize that I'm not going to speak to you. I'm going to speak through

32:50.576 --> 32:54.446
you again. We're in a situation of calling a thing

32:54.548 --> 32:57.738
a thing. The city of Houston,

32:57.914 --> 33:01.950
and I won't say that it's in bad faith,

33:02.370 --> 33:06.414
but I will call it disingenuous that outwardly

33:06.462 --> 33:11.662
the city promotes housing as a priority,

33:11.806 --> 33:15.794
as something to champion. But when you look at the

33:15.832 --> 33:18.020
real where the rubber meets the road,

33:18.890 --> 33:22.614
math is math. So I don't know what to tell you

33:22.652 --> 33:26.454
other than that. So I

33:26.492 --> 33:31.106
find it very disheartening that the

33:31.228 --> 33:35.034
citizens of this city and those that are moving here and

33:35.072 --> 33:38.506
those that live here and those that have come and told you what

33:38.528 --> 33:39.980
the reality is.

33:42.590 --> 33:45.978
I'm at a loss for words. And again, I don't

33:45.994 --> 33:49.418
use the word bad faith or lack of good faith.

33:49.514 --> 33:53.310
I genuinely use the word disingenuous.

33:53.730 --> 33:57.522
You put your money where your mouth is. Your money is what your

33:57.576 --> 34:01.060
priorities are. And I think that

34:02.870 --> 34:06.466
this is just a bad deal. So that's all

34:06.488 --> 34:07.940
I got to say about that.

34:12.010 --> 34:14.950
Well, just one comment.

34:15.530 --> 34:18.694
We are very understanding and we

34:18.732 --> 34:22.360
sympathize about all of the issues. And we do understand

34:22.730 --> 34:26.186
it would be great if we could help each and every individual

34:26.368 --> 34:29.690
that needs assistance. There's a lot of people in this city

34:29.760 --> 34:33.394
that need assistance. We just don't have the resources

34:33.462 --> 34:37.354
to do it. Even if we got an abundance

34:37.402 --> 34:40.494
amount of money from general fund, it still would

34:40.532 --> 34:43.694
not be enough to have

34:43.732 --> 34:47.200
a significant impact on all the individuals in this city.

34:47.730 --> 34:51.246
And we are trying to do the best we can by leveraging

34:51.278 --> 34:54.994
the dollars that we have in order to have the greatest impact. Well.

34:55.032 --> 34:58.450
Thank you, Director. I think I speak for all of us when we say that

34:58.520 --> 35:01.506
we understand that you all are doing the best that you can with the resources

35:01.538 --> 35:05.382
that you have. The city of Houston has priorities all across

35:05.436 --> 35:08.934
the board, from solid waste to public safety to housing to

35:08.972 --> 35:12.582
parks to libraries to airports to you name it. This is a city

35:12.636 --> 35:15.670
with over 2 million people with a limited budget.

35:15.750 --> 35:19.222
If you have $5 billion and you take from one department,

35:19.286 --> 35:22.314
you have to give to another. And so we're trying to find ways in which

35:22.352 --> 35:25.902
to allocate dollars in a fair and equitable manner, but also

35:25.956 --> 35:29.710
trying to make sure that we reach the necessary needs of

35:29.780 --> 35:33.246
all Houstonians. There's those that may feel like

35:33.268 --> 35:36.478
we should put more money in housing and take more money away from a

35:36.484 --> 35:40.340
different department, and then you have those

35:41.110 --> 35:44.786
who say that we need more money in a different department to take

35:44.808 --> 35:48.190
away from another department. So you're always going to have to have a balance.

35:48.350 --> 35:52.446
And that's why you elect us to try to listen to your concerns,

35:52.478 --> 35:55.382
which we do. And we thank all of you all for coming forward to present

35:55.436 --> 35:59.286
those, but it's still a balance that we have to fit. And I

35:59.308 --> 36:03.206
think your department does an excellent job of trying to do

36:03.228 --> 36:06.646
the best you can with the dollars that you have. And I

36:06.668 --> 36:09.560
want you all to know that directly from us as well.

36:10.730 --> 36:14.206
There are no additional public speakers. This includes our

36:14.228 --> 36:18.266
housing department workshop. We will now adjourn the housing department budget

36:18.298 --> 36:18.570
workshop.
