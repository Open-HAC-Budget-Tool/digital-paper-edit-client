WEBVTT

00:00.170 --> 00:04.400
You. So thank you. Thank you. We'll now move into the

00:04.850 --> 00:08.670
patient, overly patient It department,

00:10.370 --> 00:13.360
as we are now officially 55 minutes over.

00:16.770 --> 00:20.782
But I'm sure Director Kent will make up for that 55 minutes

00:20.836 --> 00:21.920
of lost time.

00:55.450 --> 00:59.254
Am I on? So,

00:59.292 --> 01:01.350
good afternoon. Good afternoon.

01:02.330 --> 01:06.418
As mayor pro Tim Martin indicated, I am Lisa Kent.

01:06.514 --> 01:10.294
I am the city's chief information officer and the director

01:10.422 --> 01:14.442
of the Houston It. Services Department. With me.

01:14.496 --> 01:17.654
Here is William Bryant. William was introduced

01:17.702 --> 01:20.914
first by Director Emo. He is the department

01:20.982 --> 01:25.550
fiscal Administrator assigned to Hits. He is a member of the finance organization.

01:26.770 --> 01:30.682
Will serves in a CFO like function for my department.

01:30.826 --> 01:34.670
And I also want to acknowledge the two financial analysts that support

01:34.740 --> 01:37.826
Will. One of them is here today. That's herbert Gardner. He's raising his

01:37.848 --> 01:41.106
hand back there. And the other one is Curia askew. She's out of

01:41.128 --> 01:44.834
the office today, so she's not present. So together, this team

01:44.872 --> 01:48.622
of three helps manage a very large and complex

01:48.686 --> 01:52.422
budget for the Hits department. And I want to thank them

01:52.476 --> 01:55.666
for helping me prepare this presentation and all the data associated

01:55.698 --> 01:59.186
with it. I also want to give a huge shout out to the Hits executive

01:59.218 --> 02:03.498
team. They are not here. They are busy working on all the projects that support

02:03.584 --> 02:07.194
you and our customers. But I will acknowledge them

02:07.312 --> 02:11.066
in the next few slides and give you a little flavor for what

02:11.088 --> 02:14.910
they do in our organization. Many of you, in fact,

02:14.980 --> 02:18.654
most of you, have met all of my direct reports and know them from

02:18.692 --> 02:21.998
either Cyber or TTI presentations. And I

02:22.004 --> 02:25.482
know you know how proud I am of them, each one of them personally,

02:25.546 --> 02:29.006
as well as for the professional work that they do for the city of Houston

02:29.118 --> 02:32.498
each and every day. So with that, let's get started, and we'll go to the

02:32.504 --> 02:33.410
next slide.

02:36.250 --> 02:39.574
So the proposed fiscal year 23 budget for

02:39.612 --> 02:43.880
Hits is $98,051,415.

02:44.250 --> 02:48.322
Hits budget is entirely a central services revolving

02:48.386 --> 02:51.626
fund, which means that the funding we spend

02:51.728 --> 02:55.274
is charged back to those departments who consume our services.

02:55.472 --> 02:58.966
And that chargeback shows up in each of those department budgets

02:58.998 --> 03:02.814
under their restricted accounts. Our FY 23

03:02.852 --> 03:07.002
budget includes the funding for 210.6 positions.

03:07.066 --> 03:10.510
Please note that the FTE funded account amount

03:10.580 --> 03:14.846
for the previous year FY 22 was 202 positions,

03:14.958 --> 03:18.740
with a vacancy factor of around 7.4%.

03:19.510 --> 03:23.678
This FY 23 increase in the funded FTEs

03:23.774 --> 03:27.794
is due to the consolidation of It personnel from

03:27.832 --> 03:31.186
three different departments. So these are not net new positions.

03:31.218 --> 03:34.520
They are positions that are moving from one department into the other.

03:34.890 --> 03:39.062
For FY 23, we did choose to increase our vacancy factor

03:39.126 --> 03:42.460
to approximately 7.77%.

03:42.910 --> 03:46.074
The decision to do that was made in consideration not only

03:46.112 --> 03:49.846
of the economic conditions, but specifically

03:49.958 --> 03:53.310
from the significant challenges that we're encountering in the It

03:53.380 --> 03:56.474
market and that is adversely impacting our ability

03:56.522 --> 04:00.266
to recruit It professionals. You may recall Director

04:00.298 --> 04:04.270
Emo referenced the great resignation in her initial presentation.

04:05.010 --> 04:08.590
This is certainly something that is impacting it everywhere.

04:08.670 --> 04:11.694
It is not a problem that is unique to the City of Houston.

04:11.822 --> 04:15.362
I am a member of the Inspire Houston CIOs group

04:15.416 --> 04:19.474
for the city of the Houston regional area. I regularly

04:19.522 --> 04:23.366
talk and visit with CIOs from all parts of the business,

04:23.468 --> 04:26.614
including private sector, and every single one of us

04:26.652 --> 04:30.554
is facing this challenge. And so this is something that is

04:30.592 --> 04:34.582
not unique to City of Houston government. Looking department

04:34.646 --> 04:38.266
wide below that first chart. This body of

04:38.288 --> 04:42.486
the slide shows the distribution of funds and personnel across seven key areas

04:42.518 --> 04:46.442
within our department. You can see the breakdown of budget and personnel

04:46.506 --> 04:49.374
for each of those areas. I'm not going to read this chart, but it's there

04:49.412 --> 04:51.710
for your reference. So, next slide.

04:54.290 --> 04:57.530
Now let's go through those key functions. I'm going to do this quickly in a

04:57.540 --> 05:01.234
more abbreviated fashion than I would normally have done. But I do want to start

05:01.272 --> 05:04.658
out that at the Director's office level, as the CIO for the City of

05:04.664 --> 05:08.454
Houston, I am responsible for It strategic planning and

05:08.492 --> 05:12.278
It governance. In addition to that, we have the amazing

05:12.444 --> 05:16.146
Dr. Jane Wu, who is assistant director for our Resource Management

05:16.178 --> 05:20.070
division. She's responsible for those additional functions underneath.

05:20.230 --> 05:23.834
Next, the cybersecurity team is led by the city's Chief Information

05:23.952 --> 05:27.542
Security Officer, who is another incredibly talented

05:27.606 --> 05:31.114
and powerful leader. That's Dr. Christopher Mitchell. And yes, we do

05:31.152 --> 05:34.478
have two PhDs as part of my Direct Reports team.

05:34.564 --> 05:38.094
We're very proud of that. Chris is responsible for

05:38.132 --> 05:41.690
those things that you see listed below. I do want to emphasize

05:41.770 --> 05:45.074
that for FY 23, we will be beginning our efforts to

05:45.112 --> 05:48.770
develop the next four year Master plan. And the focus

05:48.840 --> 05:51.934
of that going forward will be building an infrastructure

05:51.982 --> 05:55.774
with a zero trust model. And so council member Cayman

05:55.822 --> 05:58.854
in advance. I know you're going to be asking the question, what are

05:58.892 --> 06:02.294
ways that you guys can support us or unmet needs? We are

06:02.332 --> 06:06.194
always going to ask for additional support and additional funding

06:06.242 --> 06:09.734
for our cybersecurity program. So you'll hear

06:09.772 --> 06:13.434
more from us in the private briefings that we address with you and where

06:13.472 --> 06:16.554
we educate you a little bit on what we're facing and what we're doing about

06:16.592 --> 06:20.234
it. Transitioning to

06:20.272 --> 06:23.598
Enterprise infrastructure services. The Deputy CIO position

06:23.684 --> 06:27.214
for this functional area is currently vacant. However, we are

06:27.252 --> 06:31.034
very blessed to have two strong and capable leaders underneath

06:31.082 --> 06:34.314
that vacant position. And so those two groups are

06:34.372 --> 06:37.726
the network and telecom services group, led by Assistant Director Anthony

06:37.758 --> 06:41.646
Evigan and the Compute services, led by Assistant Director

06:41.678 --> 06:45.266
Burke Corford. This is our largest organization, as you can

06:45.288 --> 06:48.790
see from the Plier side, both on dollars and on

06:48.940 --> 06:53.286
positions. And so you can take a look later at all the amazing

06:53.388 --> 06:55.880
things that they do and to keep the city running.

06:56.490 --> 07:00.374
Next slide. Next is Public

07:00.412 --> 07:04.230
Safety Communications, and this is led by a very strong technical

07:04.310 --> 07:08.006
leader, and that is Assistant Director Nick Curran, one of the things that's

07:08.038 --> 07:11.322
not listed in this description. So just a feel for scale.

07:11.466 --> 07:14.814
We support over 18,000 radios within the

07:14.852 --> 07:18.206
city of Houston. Those are largely police and fire. They're a

07:18.228 --> 07:21.566
combination of handheld or portable radios in

07:21.588 --> 07:24.718
addition to the in car or mobile radios.

07:24.894 --> 07:29.202
Besides those 18,000, we also support 6600

07:29.256 --> 07:32.498
radios, for which we sell those services to

07:32.584 --> 07:36.370
more than 30 greater Houston regional partners.

07:37.350 --> 07:41.682
And then these last three programming areas are all led by Summer Shao.

07:41.826 --> 07:45.526
Summer is one of the real transformational forces on our

07:45.548 --> 07:49.158
Direct Reports team. We couldn't do our job without

07:49.244 --> 07:52.714
her and her capable folks. She is responsible for those.

07:52.752 --> 07:56.074
Next three. I'm not going to read each one of them, but I will point

07:56.112 --> 07:59.866
out that Enterprise Application Services

07:59.968 --> 08:03.546
encompasses ERP, which Council Member Kubosh,

08:03.578 --> 08:07.434
I know you sometimes ask me about acronyms that is essentially Enterprise

08:07.482 --> 08:10.842
Resources Management and Planning is our SAP

08:10.906 --> 08:15.060
platform. So that's our financial procurement and HR system.

08:15.670 --> 08:19.134
That group also includes data management, enterprise, GIS,

08:19.182 --> 08:22.798
analytics and so forth. And then client management solutions.

08:22.894 --> 08:26.534
Those are CSMART. That's the courts where my

08:26.572 --> 08:30.210
team maintains the system that Judge Marshall's organization

08:30.290 --> 08:33.654
uses to operate her business. And then finally we have

08:33.692 --> 08:37.774
the Hits It Project Management Group, which works on project governance,

08:37.922 --> 08:41.590
scope development metrics, and so forth to help us ensure that those projects

08:41.670 --> 08:44.570
meet the expected outcomes. Next slide.

08:47.230 --> 08:50.870
So there aren't any direct statutes that require us to implement

08:50.950 --> 08:54.826
specific electronic systems. However, all of the city departments

08:54.858 --> 08:58.330
that you hear from depend on Hits in order to implement

08:58.410 --> 09:01.886
their business, and many of them do have statutory requirements to

09:01.908 --> 09:05.702
conduct certain services. These three cyber statutes

09:05.786 --> 09:08.546
listed below, I'm not going to go through each one of them, but I know

09:08.568 --> 09:12.414
that you recognize HIPAA and PCI and security sensitive

09:12.462 --> 09:16.390
information that affects our airport system. Next slide.

09:18.570 --> 09:21.190
In terms of societal impact, again,

09:21.260 --> 09:24.502
all city departments depend on us. We have

09:24.556 --> 09:28.006
several stats listed there that you can read through that give you a feel for

09:28.028 --> 09:31.714
the scale of what we support. At the bottom of the chart,

09:31.762 --> 09:35.322
I did list just a few examples of citizen facing services,

09:35.456 --> 09:38.906
and we had planned to share some statistics with you. I can get those to

09:38.928 --> 09:42.966
you offline if you're interested. But Council Member Kubosh,

09:42.998 --> 09:46.154
one of those was infor, as a matter of fact, for dawn statistics

09:46.202 --> 09:49.040
about how much they use that platform for.

09:50.050 --> 09:53.418
Next slide. So let's talk about funding.

09:53.514 --> 09:57.426
This is the second fiscal year that Hits is budgeted completely in the

09:57.448 --> 10:01.362
revolving fund. Therefore, all of our expenses are revolved back

10:01.416 --> 10:05.006
or charged back to the city department customers. The chargeback

10:05.038 --> 10:08.338
is seen as an expense again in their restricted accounts, but it's

10:08.354 --> 10:11.282
offsetting as revenue for my department. And so therefore,

10:11.346 --> 10:15.234
this table that you see on this chart represents

10:15.362 --> 10:18.914
a revenue table, and it matches the expenditures table

10:18.962 --> 10:22.010
that you'll see on the next slide. These amounts will always be the same.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.860
We have to zero out our budget at the end of the year.

10:26.590 --> 10:30.266
Thank you. So the revenue highlights. Again,

10:30.368 --> 10:33.806
most of our revenue comes back, but here's a couple of unique revenues that we

10:33.828 --> 10:38.010
generate that you might not know about. The first is the Verizon Wireless Rebate

10:38.170 --> 10:42.462
in FY 22. Actual revenues already collected is a million dollars.

10:42.596 --> 10:46.210
Of that, 794,000 went to the General

10:46.280 --> 10:50.414
Government Revenue Fund, 43,000 went to the Houston Airport

10:50.462 --> 10:53.842
System and 163,000 went to Houston Public

10:53.896 --> 10:57.326
Works. Another cool revenue source is that radio revenue

10:57.358 --> 11:00.806
that I talked about. That will be $1.9 million by

11:00.828 --> 11:04.406
the time we end this fiscal year. And again, that is

11:04.428 --> 11:08.310
booked to the city's general Revenue Fund. Next slide.

11:10.430 --> 11:14.186
So, expenditures. This chart represents a historical view of

11:14.208 --> 11:17.530
our expenditures. The variance column over to the right,

11:17.600 --> 11:20.954
second to last, shows you the comparison of FY 23

11:20.992 --> 11:24.654
to FY 22 adopted budget. As you can see, that variance is

11:24.692 --> 11:28.158
10.8% and I'll go into some details about that on the

11:28.164 --> 11:29.150
next slide.

11:31.890 --> 11:36.590
So the overall proposed budget we are submitting again is 98,051,000

11:36.660 --> 11:40.034
in change. Of that only 31% is for

11:40.072 --> 11:44.018
personnel. 69% of our budget is for services

11:44.104 --> 11:47.746
and supplies that provide those products and services

11:47.848 --> 11:51.314
to other departments. The pie chart on the right is that

11:51.352 --> 11:54.886
nonpersonal breakdown. That 69%. And so one

11:54.908 --> 11:58.322
thing that's important to note over the past few years we've made significant

11:58.386 --> 12:01.770
progress in benchmarking our expenses to similar It

12:01.840 --> 12:05.338
organizations of like size and function. And so

12:05.424 --> 12:08.570
one of the things that you'll notice in this presentation is we are using

12:08.640 --> 12:12.106
those same categories that align with the Gartner It budget

12:12.138 --> 12:15.898
tool that we use for benchmarking. I'll start with this chart

12:15.994 --> 12:19.886
with traditional software and I'll move clockwise around that particular

12:19.988 --> 12:23.518
chart. Traditional software makes up 24%

12:23.604 --> 12:27.502
of our expenditures and that represents software that is installed physically

12:27.566 --> 12:31.278
on our equipment in our data centers. The next one is SaaS

12:31.374 --> 12:34.978
or Software as a service that makes up 16%.

12:35.064 --> 12:39.062
And SaaS is an example of a vendor provided and maintained product

12:39.196 --> 12:42.840
in the cloud. An example would be Office 365.

12:44.330 --> 12:47.494
The next 15% includes expenses related to

12:47.532 --> 12:51.210
education, training and supplies to support our operations.

12:52.030 --> 12:55.430
The next one is transport. Transport portion represents

12:55.510 --> 12:59.254
21% and that is projected expenses for mobile,

12:59.302 --> 13:04.782
fixed data and voice services, citywide pass

13:04.916 --> 13:08.318
or platform as a service along with other public cloud.

13:08.404 --> 13:11.834
And Is which is infrastructure as a service. Those represent

13:11.882 --> 13:15.746
a combined 2% and they are public cloud management and

13:15.768 --> 13:19.266
security services. In simpler terms, those are the

13:19.288 --> 13:22.686
things where we use a vendor's infrastructure and that is shared

13:22.718 --> 13:26.694
so that we get improved economies of scale and flexibility for

13:26.732 --> 13:30.134
scaling up and scaling down very quickly. Examples of that would be

13:30.172 --> 13:33.702
Azure or Amazon Web Services. Next.

13:33.756 --> 13:37.490
The 17% is allocated to traditional outsourcing

13:37.570 --> 13:41.286
and they are the fees that we pay for consultants and managed

13:41.318 --> 13:44.794
services where we may hire a company to do a service for

13:44.832 --> 13:48.746
us like communications, cabling or portions of

13:48.768 --> 13:52.714
our telecom infrastructure. And then the final category is 5% for

13:52.752 --> 13:56.414
hardware. One important point to note on that, we do buy

13:56.452 --> 13:59.786
a lot of hardware through our capital improvement budget. So it's not surprising

13:59.818 --> 14:03.970
that hardware is a lower percentage in the operating budget. Next slide.

14:06.150 --> 14:09.906
Now I would like to highlight some of the net changes in

14:09.928 --> 14:13.442
the proposed FY 23 budget over FY 22.

14:13.576 --> 14:16.822
The first item you will see again that we are

14:16.876 --> 14:20.866
consolidating resources. Five of those FTEs

14:20.978 --> 14:24.806
are coming from the Houston Health Department in the

14:24.828 --> 14:28.550
infrastructure area. Three are from Houston Public Works.

14:28.620 --> 14:32.150
That is part of our consolidation of cybersecurity for that department.

14:32.230 --> 14:35.802
Those are moving under dr. Chris Mitchell. And then the last one

14:35.856 --> 14:39.114
is in Legal, a partial consolidation. And those

14:39.152 --> 14:42.798
folks that one individual physician is moving under our infrastructure team.

14:42.884 --> 14:46.270
So together these combined are 1.34 million.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.710
Again moving into my department from another department.

14:50.690 --> 14:54.190
Secondly, you can see the hope increases for approximately

14:54.270 --> 14:57.806
846,000 increase over last year's budget.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.854
Next you'll see two net new initiatives. Those expenditure

15:01.902 --> 15:05.018
lines have been submitted for approval to the administration.

15:05.214 --> 15:09.222
These dollars support the maintenance of our open data portal and

15:09.276 --> 15:12.406
also new radio security services which

15:12.428 --> 15:16.230
is going to help us protect our radio system

15:16.380 --> 15:20.010
from malicious software and other malicious activity.

15:20.830 --> 15:24.966
And finally, the restricted accounts for Hits consist of allocations Hits

15:24.998 --> 15:28.822
receives from other departments such as Ara, Human Resources,

15:28.886 --> 15:33.914
Finance and Planning. So in summary, we have a 10.8% increase.

15:34.042 --> 15:38.510
I will highlight the key portions of that increase on the upcoming slide.

15:41.410 --> 15:45.314
So I won't go over it consolidation again, but I will move down

15:45.352 --> 15:48.574
to some of what you'll see in our budget is a realignment of expenses.

15:48.622 --> 15:52.500
So for example, Director Emo referenced Hits is the

15:52.950 --> 15:56.354
pilot department. We are always up for a challenge and being

15:56.392 --> 16:00.006
the guinea pig for the city to try things first. And so as part of

16:00.028 --> 16:03.430
that initiative, we went through and looked at one of the areas we needed to

16:03.500 --> 16:07.046
separate from one cost center into two was our end

16:07.068 --> 16:10.246
user Compute support services. So that's just dividing those into two

16:10.268 --> 16:14.998
cost centers and that will also help us with cleaner chargeback.

16:15.174 --> 16:18.634
Another example of Realignment is in the data management area.

16:18.672 --> 16:21.520
This is another one council member Kubosh asked me about.

16:21.970 --> 16:25.934
We hired the Edo, which is the Enterprise data Officer his name

16:25.972 --> 16:29.870
is Raphael Luvre. And when we did that hire,

16:30.930 --> 16:34.750
we did realign the expenses of the resources that now can report

16:34.820 --> 16:38.706
up under that separate cost center for those functions. I also want

16:38.728 --> 16:42.546
to point out that the hiring of the Edo helped us as

16:42.568 --> 16:46.086
a city accomplish one of the actions required by the

16:46.108 --> 16:49.560
Resilient Houston plan. That's action number 44.1.

16:51.450 --> 16:55.330
And then finally on Realignments we are also adjusting

16:55.410 --> 16:58.954
costs between Esignature and managed print services.

16:59.072 --> 17:02.970
So in further support of Resilient Houston and the climate action plan.

17:03.120 --> 17:06.934
We are driving print costs down and we are encouraging

17:06.982 --> 17:10.342
an increased usage of Esignature. So more

17:10.416 --> 17:13.630
electronic processing, less printing

17:16.610 --> 17:19.550
transitioning. Let's talk about Microsoft.

17:20.050 --> 17:23.246
Last August, Microsoft announced that they

17:23.268 --> 17:27.266
would be rolling out a substantive price increase across the

17:27.288 --> 17:30.910
board to all Office 365 subscribers. That's global.

17:30.990 --> 17:34.706
Okay? We were grandfathered in. That's why it did not affect my budget in

17:34.728 --> 17:38.194
FY 22. We were still under the current Enterprise

17:38.242 --> 17:41.862
agreement where the pricing was locked. However, next month

17:41.916 --> 17:45.254
I will be coming to the TTI committee to present to you the

17:45.292 --> 17:49.366
proposed new three year enterprise agreement for the city and

17:49.388 --> 17:52.394
that will incorporate the price increase as

17:52.432 --> 17:55.446
well as an upgrade in features that we will be requesting.

17:55.478 --> 17:59.574
So you'll hear a lot more from me about what's involved in those prices.

17:59.702 --> 18:03.066
But just a little preview, that's part of what

18:03.248 --> 18:05.790
is included in our FY 23 budget.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.486
And then next, we've already discussed a little bit about the job market and the

18:09.508 --> 18:13.226
great resignation. One of the things that we had to include in our budget

18:13.258 --> 18:16.414
for FY 23, we noticed the most significant

18:16.462 --> 18:20.130
attrition in our ERP group. Again, that's our SAP support

18:20.200 --> 18:24.046
function. And so we did submit as part of our budget

18:24.078 --> 18:27.566
to augment that ERP team. That addresses the concern

18:27.598 --> 18:31.062
that we're having not only with retirement and attrition, but the

18:31.116 --> 18:34.386
difficulty in the extended periods of time it's taking us to recruit,

18:34.418 --> 18:38.030
to backfill. And then finally in the cybersecurity

18:38.130 --> 18:42.102
insurance sector, this continues to diminish

18:42.246 --> 18:46.086
as more providers vacate that space. That results

18:46.118 --> 18:50.406
in an increase in premiums and it also results

18:50.438 --> 18:54.126
in a reduction of coverage. And so that's something that you

18:54.148 --> 18:57.274
will hear more from us about in some of the private briefings.

18:57.402 --> 19:01.674
And so there you have it. That is a summary of the FY 23 expenditure

19:01.722 --> 19:05.690
changes. This concludes my presentation.

19:05.770 --> 19:09.058
I do want to invite you to browse through the appendix. There are

19:09.064 --> 19:12.798
a lot of documents back there that talk about not only our organization,

19:12.974 --> 19:15.278
but also our strategic priorities,

19:15.454 --> 19:18.386
challenges with technological debt,

19:18.578 --> 19:22.146
and our FY 22 accomplishments. So with that, I'll be glad

19:22.178 --> 19:26.514
to take your questions. Thank you, Director Kent. Council Member Michael Kubosh.

19:26.642 --> 19:30.534
Thank you very much, Director Kent. I appreciate your biweekly

19:30.582 --> 19:34.918
report for the Open Finance. The cybersecurity

19:35.014 --> 19:38.842
that you have us take online is

19:38.896 --> 19:42.798
extremely helpful to people like me that I

19:42.884 --> 19:46.186
wasn't born with a mouse in my hand. So I've

19:46.218 --> 19:50.110
learned a lot from those cyber security courses.

19:50.930 --> 19:54.630
I appreciate you giving us advanced notice on rates

19:54.650 --> 19:58.578
and rate increases and things that we have to purchase because it used to just

19:58.744 --> 20:02.434
give this council shell shock when we'd see these things

20:02.552 --> 20:06.114
appear. Do we get federal grants to help

20:06.152 --> 20:10.134
us to pay for cybersecurity? Is there anything available that

20:10.172 --> 20:14.022
may help us to mitigate the cost of some of these things?

20:14.156 --> 20:17.746
Yes, sir. We do get federal grant money through UASI, and that

20:17.788 --> 20:21.546
is granted through the City's Department of

20:21.568 --> 20:25.594
homeland Security under Chief Eunuch. What we get

20:25.632 --> 20:28.810
from them is largely training. We do

20:28.880 --> 20:35.490
seek to get more money, and we have been lobbying federal legislatures,

20:35.590 --> 20:39.034
legislators, to help us have the federal

20:39.082 --> 20:42.350
government release more cybersecurity money to actually buy

20:42.420 --> 20:46.174
product and services. Now, I do expect to see

20:46.212 --> 20:49.634
that in some of the new federal bills. We have not yet

20:49.672 --> 20:53.074
seen it trickle down, but you might see that in the infrastructure bill once

20:53.112 --> 20:56.726
it's finally announced. I would like to see updated times where

20:56.748 --> 21:00.642
you give us this mandatory cybersecurity

21:00.706 --> 21:04.726
training because I think it's really needed and I

21:04.748 --> 21:08.870
really do appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, council Member Abby Cayman.

21:09.290 --> 21:12.826
Thank you, Mayor. Pro TEM director. I think you know where

21:12.848 --> 21:16.106
my questions are going to be, are going to go towards but I

21:16.128 --> 21:19.830
think it's startling. A lot of the budget presentations

21:19.910 --> 21:23.100
we see personnel is the major cost.

21:23.470 --> 21:26.766
You don't see that with it. I think that's two things, but correct me if

21:26.788 --> 21:30.314
I'm wrong. One, we don't have a lot of personnel

21:30.362 --> 21:33.854
in the department. I work with Dr. Mitchell and you a lot. I don't know

21:33.892 --> 21:37.570
how he does everything that he does. He is incredible.

21:38.230 --> 21:42.270
But it's also the cost of this type of equipment, the technological

21:42.350 --> 21:46.514
cost, that, again, a lot of it's behind the scenes, but it's

21:46.642 --> 21:49.510
necessary to keep the city safe.

21:50.570 --> 21:54.102
I know that we cannot in a public realm discuss a lot

21:54.156 --> 21:57.982
as it relates to Homeland Security concerns,

21:58.146 --> 22:04.486
cyber concerns, but we have seen some of the more public hacks

22:04.518 --> 22:08.220
and things like that that have occurred. For example, Kronos was

22:08.670 --> 22:12.682
something that actually didn't impact us as much as it did other businesses,

22:12.746 --> 22:16.270
but still had an impact that wasn't against city infrastructure.

22:16.850 --> 22:20.894
But given the current

22:21.012 --> 22:24.340
dynamics, the war in Ukraine, other issues,

22:25.750 --> 22:29.938
where are we as a city, just generally speaking, in terms of

22:30.104 --> 22:33.374
coming into moving beyond the last century,

22:33.502 --> 22:35.780
in terms of technology upgrades here?

22:37.850 --> 22:41.746
Thank you for asking that question. I will give you a measured

22:41.778 --> 22:45.542
response. We can provide and do

22:45.596 --> 22:48.794
provide a lot of detailed information to

22:48.832 --> 22:52.762
you, city council members, and obviously to Mayor Turner that are

22:52.816 --> 22:57.462
very specific about what the city faces from a cybersecurity

22:57.526 --> 23:01.354
perspective. What I will say publicly

23:01.482 --> 23:05.774
is that with

23:05.812 --> 23:09.242
your support, we have been making tremendous

23:09.306 --> 23:13.070
strides. One of the things that you will see spoken

23:13.150 --> 23:16.962
about publicly with anyone talking about

23:17.016 --> 23:20.542
cybersecurity is the need for a layered defense

23:20.606 --> 23:24.274
strategy. And so no matter which

23:24.312 --> 23:27.602
entity you talk to, government or private sector alike,

23:27.666 --> 23:31.286
they will all tell you we're always going to need to

23:31.308 --> 23:35.302
do more. Okay? And so what we need

23:35.356 --> 23:39.166
you to understand is much to Council Member Kubosh's

23:39.218 --> 23:42.614
comment, that it takes everybody, it takes the employees

23:42.662 --> 23:46.202
to be security conscious, and it takes us to put

23:46.256 --> 23:49.626
many layers of defense in there simply to have

23:49.648 --> 23:52.986
a fighting chance at slowing down the adversary. I could

23:53.008 --> 23:55.920
be put back in queue. Go ahead,

23:57.010 --> 24:00.430
last one. You're the only one. All right, I'll hurry up because I know

24:00.500 --> 24:04.514
people want a quick break for lunch, if we can. Not yet,

24:04.712 --> 24:07.650
no, keep driving.

24:09.750 --> 24:13.234
I was just at a roundtable conversation this morning

24:13.432 --> 24:17.186
with FEMA. So we're talking about the federal dollars that we need

24:17.208 --> 24:21.090
to draw down upon. And we were talking with different colleagues

24:21.170 --> 24:23.814
around the country about what keeps us up at night,

24:23.932 --> 24:26.994
and cybersecurity redundancy is what keeps

24:27.042 --> 24:30.954
me up at night. But also, Council Member

24:30.992 --> 24:34.762
Peck and I talk a lot about this other council members, our CAD system,

24:34.896 --> 24:38.522
other needs that are just so high

24:38.576 --> 24:42.730
in terms of price tag that we as a city cannot afford without those investments.

24:42.810 --> 24:46.286
We have CAD. That is a need. Are there other needs that we should be

24:46.308 --> 24:49.680
aware of right now as it relates to those

24:51.570 --> 24:55.002
It assets

24:55.066 --> 24:58.882
that we can speak about publicly? Yes. If you would

24:58.936 --> 25:02.142
flip to page 20, which is in the appendix section.

25:02.206 --> 25:05.990
There's a chart there that gives you a feel for the scale.

25:06.650 --> 25:10.162
When we talk about technical debt or technological

25:10.226 --> 25:14.214
debt, we're talking about systems that no

25:14.252 --> 25:18.478
different than what Director Haddock spoke about with her infrastructure

25:18.594 --> 25:23.174
for water and sewer. The city has infrastructure,

25:23.302 --> 25:27.110
both hardware and software applications that we have to maintain.

25:27.190 --> 25:31.278
And when you don't replace those often enough, you create

25:31.364 --> 25:34.714
a vulnerability, which translates

25:34.762 --> 25:38.094
to risk. Those equipments either get old and

25:38.132 --> 25:42.654
they don't function as well as they used to, or they are

25:42.692 --> 25:46.206
no longer supported by the manufacturer. And therefore, that translates into a cyber

25:46.238 --> 25:49.378
risk. So this chart, that's worth looking at. If you

25:49.384 --> 25:52.850
look on the right hand side of the page, it shows you what our five

25:52.920 --> 25:56.466
year citywide CIP is. The only

25:56.488 --> 25:59.314
thing not included in that is the Houston Airport systems.

25:59.362 --> 26:02.402
Separate CIP and Houston Public Works. Separate CIP.

26:02.466 --> 26:06.406
But otherwise, that number of 39,000,500 is

26:06.508 --> 26:10.346
the five year number for years 22 through 26 for

26:10.368 --> 26:13.914
capital investment in technology. The left hand side

26:13.952 --> 26:17.750
of the column is only the top six projects

26:17.830 --> 26:21.118
that we need funding for. Really? Four and a

26:21.124 --> 26:25.002
half of those six are public safety technology related.

26:25.146 --> 26:28.526
So in terms of what is needed, the city

26:28.628 --> 26:32.542
needs more spending capacity to deal with

26:32.596 --> 26:36.126
public safety technology equipment. And the ones that I've listed

26:36.158 --> 26:38.450
there are HPD Radio refresh,

26:39.270 --> 26:42.846
the HPD Records Management System network refresh,

26:42.878 --> 26:46.406
which I'm saying is partially public safety related CAD, which you

26:46.428 --> 26:50.086
just asked about $17 million. The only one that

26:50.108 --> 26:54.054
is wholly not public safety related is the SAPS for

26:54.092 --> 26:57.654
Hana upgrade. But at the top, there is

26:57.692 --> 27:01.606
CSMART, where we need to do some continued technology refresh.

27:01.718 --> 27:05.002
And that does have some public safety implications with that system

27:05.056 --> 27:08.874
as well. So these monies, you can tell the

27:08.912 --> 27:12.926
dramatic skewing of what's available versus what

27:12.948 --> 27:16.126
is needed just for the top six. No,

27:16.148 --> 27:19.326
and I appreciate that highlight. And just for those in

27:19.348 --> 27:22.938
the public that are listening, when we talk about records Management systems

27:22.954 --> 27:26.862
with HPD. That sounds very basic, but there's certain data that we cannot

27:26.926 --> 27:31.214
even track right now, including when a crime involves

27:31.262 --> 27:35.582
a gun, whether that gun was stolen, whether it was obtained

27:35.646 --> 27:38.754
legally. We cannot track any of that right now,

27:38.952 --> 27:42.882
even though we're dealing with astronomical levels of gun violence. So all these basic

27:42.946 --> 27:46.040
things, right, that we think as a city we should be able to do,

27:46.490 --> 27:50.054
we are having challenges with. So I just appreciate your

27:50.092 --> 27:53.942
department. Again, so much of it goes back to Public Safety.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.794
I don't know how you do and your team do all the things that you

27:56.832 --> 28:00.902
do do, but recognizing the budgetary

28:00.966 --> 28:04.170
limitations that we are continuing to face right now.

28:04.320 --> 28:07.486
Thank you. So, Director Cant, one thing

28:07.508 --> 28:11.646
struck me and one thing only in your budget. So 22 to

28:11.668 --> 28:16.626
23, you have an interdepartmental credit

28:16.728 --> 28:20.210
for 1.3 million. Without that, you're 34 million

28:20.280 --> 28:22.420
less than what you spent last year.

28:23.190 --> 28:26.718
Right. So you had 88 you -1.3 you're at

28:26.744 --> 28:30.930
98. Because you had interdepartmental

28:31.010 --> 28:34.502
consolidations of FTE. Can you put some color around that?

28:34.556 --> 28:37.906
Because I look at it and I go at 1.34 million.

28:38.028 --> 28:41.882
That's 18 employees at $75,000.

28:42.016 --> 28:46.038
So I'm assuming we're going to see the appropriate

28:46.214 --> 28:49.210
debit from Public Works,

28:49.280 --> 28:52.350
which we didn't see because I just looked through their notes.

28:52.770 --> 28:55.870
Legal and HHD,

28:57.890 --> 29:01.294
you're getting the people, but the flow of funds isn't following you.

29:01.332 --> 29:04.846
It is following you. But the appropriate debit isn't coming out of their

29:04.868 --> 29:08.846
department's expense. That's right. Because they continue to pay for those resources

29:08.878 --> 29:12.766
that are dedicated to them. So what is a little bit confusing about we added

29:12.798 --> 29:16.190
1.3 to your budget on the increase.

29:16.270 --> 29:19.986
Yes. What is confusing about the way the revolving funds

29:20.018 --> 29:23.042
work is the money has to be on both sides of the fence.

29:23.186 --> 29:26.982
So for me to have the control of those

29:27.036 --> 29:30.934
positions and the money to fund them, it has

29:30.972 --> 29:34.090
to show up in my revolving fund budget. It also

29:34.160 --> 29:37.658
has to show up on their side of the house in their restricted account.

29:37.824 --> 29:41.290
And so when I charge them back, it goes back.

29:41.360 --> 29:44.990
So I'm looking for I see your credit of 1.3.

29:45.060 --> 29:48.926
I don't see their debit of 1.3 or whatever theirs is for their individual

29:49.108 --> 29:52.286
department, but their debit will be in their restricted account. In the

29:52.308 --> 29:56.206
restricted account. So all of our expenses are budget within the department's

29:56.238 --> 29:59.874
restricted accounts. So that slide where like on our

29:59.912 --> 30:03.678
slide number 15, where you have a list of all the inner

30:03.694 --> 30:06.750
fund restrictive accounts, we would charge them back.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.566
Okay. Why are you assuming I'm going to say 75,000.

30:10.668 --> 30:13.942
That's 18 people. Why are you assuming 18 people into your

30:13.996 --> 30:17.886
department? What's going on? We're not assuming

30:17.938 --> 30:21.386
18 individuals who we're absorbing nine, plus their

30:21.568 --> 30:25.174
hope increases. Okay, so you're absorbing their salary?

30:25.302 --> 30:29.370
Yes, only their salary, but not their reporting accountability.

30:30.030 --> 30:33.962
We're absorbing their reporting reporting structure as well.

30:34.096 --> 30:37.226
So who do they report to? Do they report to hits.

30:37.418 --> 30:40.686
Yes. In fact, that's one of the reasons why we do that, because if we

30:40.708 --> 30:44.674
leave the money exclusively in their budget, where they have the ability to choose

30:44.712 --> 30:48.340
to spend it on something else, I love the fact that

30:48.870 --> 30:52.818
your department is more of a centralized function. I hate decentralized function

30:52.904 --> 30:56.686
organizations. That's a massive screw up. You're just waiting

30:56.718 --> 30:59.782
for some bad things to happen. So I'm a big fan of what you did.

30:59.836 --> 31:03.058
Okay, great. Because I believe they should be reporting to you even though they're

31:03.074 --> 31:07.090
housed in another department. But I just wanted to see where they corresponded.

31:07.170 --> 31:10.466
Like Mayor Turner says, hey, you can raise the budget,

31:10.498 --> 31:14.060
but tell me where you're going to get the money. Well, you raised your money

31:14.590 --> 31:17.846
by 1.3 million, and you didn't

31:17.878 --> 31:21.306
tell me where it came from, because I looked back on one of the departments

31:21.338 --> 31:24.986
that already presented. The other two are later, and they didn't have the corresponding

31:25.018 --> 31:28.186
debit. It's restricted.

31:28.298 --> 31:31.866
So we'll ask Legal and we'll ask Houston

31:31.898 --> 31:35.342
Health when they come. So. Thank you, council Member Sally Alcorn.

31:35.406 --> 31:38.786
Are there some other departments that you think would benefit from

31:38.888 --> 31:42.660
being consolidated in, or have you swept everybody in that you need to?

31:44.230 --> 31:46.840
We definitely have that's a loaded question.

31:48.010 --> 31:51.910
There are definitely opportunities, and some of those opportunities are already

31:51.980 --> 31:55.846
in discussion with those directors. I wouldn't want to say that

31:55.868 --> 31:59.834
publicly, but there are definitely opportunities for that.

31:59.872 --> 32:03.306
Yes. Great. Thanks. You all

32:03.328 --> 32:06.586
do a great job. Thank you. Day in and day out. I appreciate what you

32:06.608 --> 32:10.942
do. I'm sorry. We have four public

32:10.996 --> 32:13.790
speakers. We'll start out with Mr. Doug Smith,

32:15.330 --> 32:16.830
star six. Doug,

32:20.370 --> 32:23.630
can you hear me? Yes, sir. Yes.

32:23.700 --> 32:27.070
Okay, good. To follow up on the last comment,

32:27.230 --> 32:30.546
relative to are you going to when you look through

32:30.568 --> 32:33.620
the budget, you see lots of departments that have what I would call

32:34.550 --> 32:37.830
hit related expenses, and I guess you're in the process

32:37.900 --> 32:40.982
of trying to sweep all of those in as

32:41.036 --> 32:44.786
much as possible. One that just came from this morning is Houston

32:44.818 --> 32:48.446
Public Works. They show $20 million for computer related

32:48.498 --> 32:52.054
expenses. So I'm glad to hear you're in the process of trying to rope

32:52.102 --> 32:54.460
everybody in. And one final question.

32:55.150 --> 32:58.780
Why did the salary for HFD support account

32:59.630 --> 33:03.470
50 00:10 increased by 50%?

33:03.620 --> 33:07.246
And also regarding that, do you provide any kind of similar support to

33:07.268 --> 33:10.702
the Houston Police Department? Okay.

33:10.756 --> 33:14.514
Mr. Smith, the reason why you see the increase in the HFD personnel once

33:14.552 --> 33:18.654
we've gone through the exercise of looking at the EIS

33:18.782 --> 33:22.066
compute call center, basically, we took those individuals that were

33:22.088 --> 33:25.522
dedicated to HFD and moved those to the HFD call

33:25.576 --> 33:29.126
center. So that's why you see that increase in personnel. So the

33:29.148 --> 33:32.806
support level has not changed, but we did move the position,

33:32.908 --> 33:35.830
so therefore the dollars will be in the correct funding structure.

33:36.970 --> 33:40.266
Okay. Do you do similar support for Houston Police Department as

33:40.288 --> 33:42.300
well? No, we. Do not.

33:44.110 --> 33:47.578
The Houston Police Department is what we consider to

33:47.584 --> 33:50.734
be a Federated It organization, which means they

33:50.772 --> 33:54.798
have a Chief Technology Officer and a sizable It

33:54.884 --> 33:58.046
organization. So what my department provides to

33:58.068 --> 34:01.758
HPD are the Enterprise services, which is a

34:01.764 --> 34:05.538
whole lot of things, but there are many services that they still do

34:05.624 --> 34:09.634
themselves out of that technology budget. So they will have both a

34:09.672 --> 34:13.234
restricted account chargeback from my department as well

34:13.272 --> 34:16.102
as a separate It budget for their own.

34:16.236 --> 34:19.654
Thank you. Mr. Why do they have a mr.

34:19.692 --> 34:21.270
Oliver. Jason Oliver.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.910
Thanks for interrupting.

34:27.710 --> 34:31.802
Thank you. Hi. Thank you all

34:31.936 --> 34:36.300
for the presentation. The budget was amended last year,

34:36.830 --> 34:40.766
item 6.34, to include an online portal for

34:40.788 --> 34:44.318
people to sign up for public session. I wanted to check in on

34:44.404 --> 34:48.074
if that has been implemented or if we can get a target

34:48.122 --> 34:49.120
completion date.

34:56.440 --> 34:59.864
We were just conferring, Mr. Oliver. I'm not sure that

34:59.902 --> 35:03.496
that particular amendment was actually approved, but what

35:03.518 --> 35:07.224
I can tell you, we do have a project underway that is currently in

35:07.262 --> 35:10.904
the planning phase. It won't be implemented until later in FY

35:10.952 --> 35:14.924
23, but that is to upgrade the system that the

35:14.962 --> 35:18.216
city council uses for City council agenda.

35:18.328 --> 35:21.996
And so our thought is that we would be using that same platform to

35:22.018 --> 35:25.504
allow the digital sign up of speakers. Now, one thing

35:25.542 --> 35:28.848
in addition to that that we have also been doing is to

35:29.014 --> 35:33.276
utilize tool sets that we already have to encourage the city secretary's

35:33.308 --> 35:36.912
office to leverage things like teams and SharePoint that

35:36.966 --> 35:40.628
as people sign up. That can be done on those existing tools, but we

35:40.634 --> 35:44.756
do have plans to enhance it for the future. Okay, and then can

35:44.778 --> 35:47.620
you share more about what on page eleven,

35:48.040 --> 35:51.256
the open data portal support means, and then how often we

35:51.278 --> 35:54.680
can expect to see updates in the future? I also want to say thank you

35:54.750 --> 35:59.176
all. After last year, you all updated and

35:59.198 --> 36:02.900
made the open data portal accessible again, which was really appreciated.

36:02.980 --> 36:06.156
So thank you for that. We're just checking in about what that means. So you

36:06.178 --> 36:09.756
just answered my question, your own question. So we were having a lot

36:09.778 --> 36:13.344
of problems with that open data portal where, if you may recall, it would go

36:13.382 --> 36:16.528
offline. That is a legacy application

36:16.694 --> 36:19.984
that we needed some additional support. And so the money

36:20.022 --> 36:23.936
that we built in as an ad to our budget was to outsource that

36:23.958 --> 36:27.188
additional support until we could simply redesign it.

36:27.274 --> 36:30.644
So the redesign of that open data portal is planned for FY 23

36:30.682 --> 36:35.008
as well. Thank you. Doing that support I'm

36:35.024 --> 36:38.436
sorry, who's offering that support? How is

36:38.458 --> 36:41.928
that working? I don't recall the name of the vendor off the

36:41.934 --> 36:45.176
top of my head. I can get back to you offline about that, but it

36:45.198 --> 36:49.096
is a vendor consultant that is assisting us with that. Got you. Thank you,

36:49.278 --> 36:53.260
Ms. Planning. As Ms. Planning walks up, so are we moving away from Novus

36:54.960 --> 36:58.636
there is a project to upgrade Novus. So what

36:58.658 --> 37:02.396
the solution will be is yet to be determined whether it continues

37:02.428 --> 37:06.464
to be the evolution of Novus or another product. Thank you.

37:06.662 --> 37:08.720
Hey, thank you for your presentation.

37:09.540 --> 37:13.136
Lots of helpful explanations in there. I have two questions for

37:13.158 --> 37:17.392
you. I noticed almost 60% of the top technological

37:17.456 --> 37:20.864
needs you listed, I believe it was in the appendix,

37:20.992 --> 37:24.832
belong to HPD improvements. And I was curious as to how these priorities

37:24.896 --> 37:28.456
were made, especially after you explained that HPD kind of has

37:28.478 --> 37:32.452
their own It. And then what are other priorities

37:32.516 --> 37:36.084
that aren't listed that you would consider a high priority?

37:36.212 --> 37:39.976
And then the second question is management consulting services

37:40.078 --> 37:43.340
has increased dramatically from last fiscal year, now 3 million

37:43.410 --> 37:46.700
from about 1 million. And what is the reason for that jump?

37:48.240 --> 37:51.344
Okay, so Will is going to help keep me straight on the questions in order,

37:51.382 --> 37:54.812
but let's talk first about this chart, the technological debt.

37:54.876 --> 37:58.880
Okay, so HPD participates along

37:58.950 --> 38:02.684
with all the other city departments, excluding airports

38:02.732 --> 38:05.424
and public works in the citywide,

38:05.472 --> 38:10.048
technology, CIP. So these are all investments that would be capital projects

38:10.144 --> 38:13.428
and they are a part of that solution pool or the

38:13.434 --> 38:17.072
group that considers those. The considerations

38:17.136 --> 38:20.292
for why are these systems on the list and why are they priority

38:20.436 --> 38:23.992
one, safe Houston and public safety is clearly Mayor Turner's top

38:24.046 --> 38:27.464
priority. And one of the things that we look at

38:27.502 --> 38:31.564
when we evaluate the prioritization of It spend is

38:31.602 --> 38:34.984
where there is risk. And in these cases, these equipment,

38:35.032 --> 38:38.584
these systems are all end of life and they pose risk

38:38.632 --> 38:40.780
to the city and the police department.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.320
Thank you, Mr. Butler.

38:47.300 --> 38:49.170
I don't know how to get back to her.

38:50.340 --> 38:51.090
Okay.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.908
Hi, good afternoon. I think you guys do an excellent job. I've just got

38:57.914 --> 39:01.380
a series of questions I'll use in my three minutes and then you can respond.

39:02.520 --> 39:06.064
Can you rank your top three priorities?

39:06.192 --> 39:09.880
And you did to finish up that conversation you just started that

39:09.950 --> 39:13.464
give you the best return on investment, dollar wise for every

39:13.502 --> 39:18.728
dollar you spend? The next question is basically,

39:18.814 --> 39:22.296
how are you guys going to do more with less? Because that's the way you've

39:22.328 --> 39:25.628
painted this picture. It's impressive. I just want to know how you're going to do

39:25.634 --> 39:30.312
the magic trick. The other question is, has the city's IDT

39:30.376 --> 39:34.336
department been affected by the pandemic and the supply chain in slowing down

39:34.438 --> 39:38.876
or hindering either major upgrades or rollouts

39:38.908 --> 39:42.016
or updates that you have? Also, you said you

39:42.038 --> 39:46.304
do travel and connect with other cities. Does the city of Houston rank statewide,

39:46.352 --> 39:49.716
regionally and nationally well and does your

39:49.738 --> 39:53.168
budget reflect managing city the size of Houston?

39:53.264 --> 39:56.676
And lastly, very broad question, how has it

39:56.778 --> 39:59.130
priority shifted for you and why?

40:02.380 --> 40:05.416
May I start to answer those? I don't think I can get to all of

40:05.438 --> 40:10.016
them. Okay, so can you give us Readers

40:10.068 --> 40:14.044
Digest version? Okay, so question number

40:14.082 --> 40:16.968
one top three priorities based on ROI.

40:17.144 --> 40:20.796
We definitely focus on things that pose risk, because if we

40:20.818 --> 40:24.264
don't deal with those, they present themselves as much larger,

40:24.312 --> 40:27.884
much more expensive problems to fix after the fact. Okay, so cyber

40:27.932 --> 40:31.472
is a great example, but so is aging equipment. The next

40:31.526 --> 40:34.230
one, how are we going to do more than with less?

40:34.760 --> 40:38.224
That is a big challenge. Thankfully, we hire

40:38.272 --> 40:41.830
people who like challenges. But in terms of

40:42.200 --> 40:46.368
getting the best bang for the buck, we look to identify

40:46.464 --> 40:50.104
solutions and platforms that solve multiple problems. And so

40:50.142 --> 40:53.828
you will see us identifying, particularly in the areas of applications

40:53.924 --> 40:57.764
that can meet multiple departments needs. We talked about infor earlier.

40:57.812 --> 41:01.370
We have several departments using that permitting and inspection platform.

41:01.840 --> 41:05.576
Supply chain? Yes. It's a huge problem. There are certain pieces

41:05.608 --> 41:09.116
of equipment. I won't name the manufacturer, but we have been

41:09.138 --> 41:12.252
waiting for things that normally we would get in one to two months is taking

41:12.306 --> 41:14.690
more than a year. It's a huge problem.

41:15.300 --> 41:18.624
Priority shift. How have

41:18.662 --> 41:22.304
my priorities shifted since the Pandemic? We have

41:22.342 --> 41:26.480
definitely been pushing city departments to accelerate

41:26.560 --> 41:31.364
their digital transformation. One of the things I'm very proud of from

41:31.402 --> 41:34.724
the city's infrastructure standpoint, and even our

41:34.762 --> 41:39.044
applications portfolio, many of those tools were already there.

41:39.162 --> 41:43.072
What we needed to do is help departments with the business transformation

41:43.136 --> 41:46.864
to be able to really embrace operating digitally

41:46.912 --> 41:49.900
all the way to the end. Customer out in the field.

41:50.050 --> 41:53.944
Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. And that concludes

41:53.992 --> 41:57.404
this part. And, Director Ken, as your neighbor of mine, my son came

41:57.442 --> 42:00.830
over and messed up my printer. So can you come over later on?

42:01.680 --> 42:03.150
I'll see what I can do.
