Never miss you ever else. We'll hear about

13
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:50,220
it for the rest of our lives.

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,446
Before we start, vice Chair Ed Pollard. As we begin this journey, this is the

15
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:59,870
first of I think we have 25 meetings,

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,810
23 individual departments, and then this

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,974
analysis that we'll see this morning on the five year forecast.

18
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:12,466
Any comments? No comments at this

19
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:16,130
time. Immediately following the specially called BFA

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,310
to go over the 2023 budget workshop, it will begin

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,986
with the Finance Department presenting at 01:00 today in the Houston

22
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:27,426
Fire Department presenting at 130. Additionally, the budget

23
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:31,066
workshop schedule is posted on the BFA website.

24
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:34,966
All budget workshops will be in person except for public speakers

25
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:38,570
which have the option to comment in person or virtually.

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,314
Are there any members of the public who are here in person and would

27
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,470
like to participate? There is a sign up sheet in the front table.

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,910
My staff member Carolina will be monitoring the public

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,430
speakers list. As a reminder, the only people attending public

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,290
or public speak virtually are public speakers. There are five

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,826
virtual public speakers signed up for the public comment for

32
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:04,142
this particular meeting. We will get their questions after the presentations

33
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:07,874
and after questions from council members have concluded.

34
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,606
At this time, I'd like to welcome Director Tantry Emo to provide the

35
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,430
fiscal year 2023 budget overview and

36
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,342
General Fund five year forecast.

37
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:21,818
Also like to welcome Council Member David Robinson to the

38
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,350
podium to the Horseshoe, and Deputy

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,598
Finance Chair Will The Thrill Jones.

40
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:32,750
Looking good, Will. And Council member Abby Cayman.

41
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,400
Thank you.

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,560
Thank. Good afternoon, mayor protem and council member.

43
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,090
I don't know if you have the slides on.

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,560
I am here joined by William, deputy Director William Jones.

45
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,704
He is over the financial Planning and Analysis divisions

46
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,196
presenting the fiscal year 2023 budget overview and

47
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:26,064
General Fund five year forecast. First, I do want to recognize

48
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:29,830
Mr. Jones and his limited team members. Hopefully they are all here

49
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,620
who are here today as well as Citywide Department's

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,032
financial team for pushing hard to prepare this budget on time.

51
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,856
In front of us. Again, thank you. We do have very limited

52
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:44,396
resources and I am so proud and pleased so

53
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:47,964
that we can actually get this budget done timely with

54
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:49,900
that. Let's go to the slides.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,044
Thank you. So again,

56
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:59,696
in here we will go over the budget overview and the budget revenues and

57
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:03,440
expenditures for the General fund as well as the five year forecast.

58
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,412
And we will also go over some updates on the outcome based

59
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:10,340
budgeting. Next slide.

60
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,456
Again, this is a forward looking statement so that everybody's aware

61
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,224
this is still based on the projections. Any changes in the futures will impact our

62
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:22,376
numbers. This is again the five year forecast based on our

63
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:25,290
assumptions that we can derive today.

64
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,156
Next Slides let's

65
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,328
start with the citywide expenditures, including debt

66
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:37,724
service and pay as you go in this slide. As you see,

67
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:41,528
the fiscal year 23 proposed budget for all funds, including debt

68
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:45,776
service and pay as you go is at $5.7 billion.

69
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,696
This is about $487,000,000 higher than

70
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:53,596
fiscal year 22 current budget at 5.2 billion.

71
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:56,710
This is an increase of 9.31%.

72
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,768
Again, keep in mind this citywide expenditures

73
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:04,784
includes total budget, includes general funds, special and enterprise

74
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:08,180
funds. This does not include the surface chargeback funds,

75
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,492
the enterprise funds, as you see in this slide, the enterprise funds accounts

76
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:18,328
for about 364,000,000 of that $487,000,000

77
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:21,764
increase. If you see in here, the water and sewer

78
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:25,480
had increased from 1.3 billion to 1.6 billion alone,

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,660
and that is related to the consent decree and other drinking water projects.

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,956
In fiscal year 23, General Fund alone accounts for about 48%

81
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:38,192
of the city total funds. And as you see in here,

82
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:41,452
there's a slight decrease from fiscal year 22 to reflect

83
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:45,600
the total compositions of the funds from 51%

84
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,510
to 48%. Again, because of the increased allocations on the

85
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,904
combined utility system on the General Fund, it increased

86
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:57,824
by 101,000,000, or about 3.85%

87
00:05:57,882 --> 00:06:01,560
increase, which we will go through more details later on next slide.

88
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,616
Again, this is the citywide full time equivalent for

89
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:12,196
civilians and classified. As you see

90
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,284
in here, the total FTEs we have for fiscal year 23 is

91
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:20,264
at 21,000, a slight decrease

92
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:23,980
from fiscal year 22 current budget. Again, as mentioned

93
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,756
by the Mayor yesterday, the fiscal year 23 proposed

94
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:31,884
includes cadet classes for police and fire for five classes

95
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:35,276
each. While in fiscal year 22 current budget,

96
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:38,808
it includes six cadet classes for police and four cadet classes

97
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:42,404
for fire. Another important notes to put in the fiscal year

98
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:46,592
23 proposed budget. In here. The general fund includes temporary

99
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,600
employees for the Higher Houston Youth Program. So you will see some of those numbers

100
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,400
incorporated in the General Fund FTEs.

101
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,640
Next slide.

102
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,936
Again, this is another deep dive of the General Fund compositions

103
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:06,456
from the civilian and classified from fiscal

104
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:09,836
year 15 to fiscal year 23.

105
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:13,228
Again, another thing to point in here, keep in mind the

106
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:17,664
fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 21 FTEs seems

107
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:21,596
to be lower. Again, this is due to the redeployment that was funded

108
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:25,680
out of CRF at that time. Next slide.

109
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,304
So this is the American rescue plan act. As you all know, this fiscal

110
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:36,384
year 23 proposed budget also includes funding from the ARPA,

111
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:39,316
similar to what we did last year. Again,

112
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,764
this is just a reminder. ARPA was signed into law March 11,

113
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:46,904
2021, providing 65.1

114
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:50,712
billion federal funding. Our portion for the City of Houston is about

115
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:54,196
$607.8 million in two tranches.

116
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:58,044
So we received the first tranche last year around May of

117
00:07:58,082 --> 00:08:01,832
$303,000,000. So we will be expecting the second tranche

118
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:05,168
sometime this month. Hopefully we have not yet received it.

119
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:09,500
It is typically stated to be twelve months after the first tranche.

120
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,640
The city would have until December 31,

121
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,930
2024 to use the fund.

122
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,736
Again. Unlike CRF, ARPA recognizes

123
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:22,640
the economic impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic and provides flexibility

124
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,096
to address reductions in revenues due to the COVID-19

125
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:29,940
Public health emergency. The Coronavirus State and Local

126
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,624
Fiscal Recovery Fund final rule was available by the

127
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:37,592
US. Treasury. Released on January 2022.

128
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,128
So this budget includes 160.1 million in

129
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:44,670
the ARPA utilization for the provisions of the government services

130
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,340
relative to the revenue reductions due to COVID-19 public health emergency.

131
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,140
Next slide.

132
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,952
Okay, so a quick overview of the General Fund

133
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:05,040
that we are proposing today. This budget includes 13.5%

134
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,620
fund balance of the expenditures, less debt service and pay as you go,

135
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,468
which is above the desired minimum of 7.5%, and that is

136
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:17,430
about $138,000,000 above the 7.5%.

137
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,076
This budget includes 3% pay raises for the municipal

138
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:24,868
employees, 6% pay raises for the firefighters

139
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,904
and 4% pay raises for the police. Classified this

140
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:32,380
proposed budget fully fund the budget stabilization fund. So right now we are

141
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,190
over $20 million set aside for the Budget Stabilization Fund.

142
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,072
Again, as mentioned, this funds for cadet classes,

143
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:43,564
five cadet classes each in police and fire, and also

144
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:47,004
fully fund all three pension systems. So this budget does not include

145
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:49,904
fund balance drawdown, nor one time land sales,

146
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,840
nor payment deferrals.

147
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,340
So let's start with the General Fund revenues.

148
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,432
So this is the net change of the General Fund revenues

149
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:06,820
including other sources. So that includes sale of land and transfers.

150
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Compared to the fiscal year 22 estimates, the proposed budget

151
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,432
increased by about 2.4%. So our 2.7

152
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:19,272
million compared to the fiscal year 22 estimates of 2.67

153
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:22,744
million. Let's start with the biggest increase

154
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,990
which is from the bottom, which is property tax,

155
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,424
$48.8 million increase.

156
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:32,264
And again, this is based on Proposition

157
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:35,856
One and H limitations that we have, which is based on

158
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:39,388
the populations plus CPI. Keep in mind the CPI

159
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:44,064
is already available at this point at 4.8%.

160
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:48,116
The population is still at 0% assumptions waiting until

161
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:51,750
the US census Bureau released it sometimes in May.

162
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,340
Intergovernmental this has increased by 10.4 million

163
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,736
compared to fiscal year 22 estimates. Again, this is where you see the

164
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,904
use of the ARPA funding, which is 160,000,000 compared to

165
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:08,424
fiscal year 22. We use about 139 million.

166
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:12,712
So roughly those are increases in the intergovernmental.

167
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:16,172
We also reflect transfer from other funds increased by 3.8

168
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:20,024
million. This is mainly from the Park Houston

169
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:23,864
funds. As economies start going

170
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:28,092
back to normal, so you will see some of those parking fees generated

171
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:31,596
and so the transfers start coming to increase in fiscal

172
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:34,610
year 23 charges for services,

173
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,072
this is increased due to higher than anticipated digital network

174
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:42,870
and network notes. We also have others

175
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,564
that is noted in here. This is because of the interest you see

176
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:50,344
all those low interest in last year. But now

177
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:53,816
with the increased cash that we have, we are projecting an

178
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,770
increased interest in our fiscal year 23.

179
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,376
Another decrease in here I'm going to go through the decreases is the franchise

180
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:06,412
fees. This is again mainly on the telephone franchise that

181
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:09,980
continues to decline. Next slide.

182
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,008
Again, this is just a composition allocations in the general fund

183
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:20,944
revenue categories between fiscal year 23 proposed and fiscal year

184
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:24,336
22 estimates. Again the biggest chunk that we

185
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:27,492
have in our revenue sources are two.

186
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:32,228
Property tax and sales tax continue to be our

187
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:37,028
primary sources that compose about 67 70%

188
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:40,564
of the general fund. We also have

189
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:43,992
the other funds and franchise fees as noted in here. Again, keep in mind this

190
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:47,992
revenues includes the funding from ARPA of 160,000,000

191
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:51,880
in the intergovernmental. Next slide.

192
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,716
Again, this is just another different look on

193
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:03,432
a bar chart and you could see the comparison

194
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:07,024
from fiscal year 15 all the way to fiscal year 23

195
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:10,080
proposed budget for the property tax, sales tax,

196
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,472
franchise and other revenues. You could

197
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,910
see some of those dip in fiscal year 2020

198
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,324
and 21 slight movement because again because

199
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:25,764
of the COVID Next

200
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:32,904
slide on

201
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:36,664
the property tax revenues. Again this is based on the

202
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:40,836
estimated taxable value of $289,000,000,000, which is an increase

203
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:45,032
of 8.98%. This estimated taxable

204
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:48,828
value is the net off the tax incremental agreements which

205
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,580
is 246.2 billion.

206
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,996
Again, population data from the US Census Bureau as of

207
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:59,440
July 1 has yet to be received. So our property

208
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,472
tax revenues in here is only based on the CPI index of

209
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:08,180
4.3%. I misspoke, I said 4.8 is 4.28%

210
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,212
initially and we will adjust this calculations once

211
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:16,070
the US Census Bureau data is available by the end of May.

212
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,276
So with that the increased property tax revenues is at

213
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:23,832
3.97%, which is 48.9

214
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:26,760
million higher than fiscal year 22 estimates.

215
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,804
Again, this is still based on the over 65 and disabled

216
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:34,476
exemptions at 160,000 and I know Mayor had

217
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,444
mentioned yesterday that he proposed to increase that over 65

218
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:42,540
and disabled exemptions from 160,000 to 260,000

219
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,964
in a separate council actions,

220
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:50,320
sometimes in June. Next slide

221
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,522
again, so this is based on the budget

222
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:01,206
versus actual of the property tax revenues from fiscal

223
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:03,500
year 19 to fiscal year 23.

224
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,754
Again, the adopted budget since fiscal year 15 is

225
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:11,350
based on the proposition one plus H and you

226
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,878
could see the delta between those with the actual.

227
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:18,506
So fiscal year 22 estimates right now is not projected

228
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:22,800
to be changing, so we are still remaining our projections at the

229
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,594
revenue cap and again fiscal year

230
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:29,940
23 proposed budget is also at the revenue cap.

231
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,530
Next slide.

232
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,014
And you've seen this before, this is just a

233
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:44,920
chart to show the impact of the charter cap

234
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,514
to what we have at this time since

235
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:53,340
fiscal year 17. So again since fiscal year 19 we already

236
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,194
hit the property revenue cap where we were

237
00:15:57,232 --> 00:16:01,270
based on the populations plus CPI growth

238
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,182
in our revenues. But if we did not have that

239
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:09,790
so you could see in here the impact of that is about 1.4 billion

240
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,758
from fiscal year 15. The impact of the prop

241
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:17,458
the revenue cap we have for fiscal year 23 as you see in

242
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:20,500
there is at $282,000,000.

243
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,640
Next slide. Thank you.

244
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,502
Moving on to the sales tax revenues. Again, we are

245
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:36,066
conservative as we are heading into fiscal year 23 budget.

246
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:39,286
So we keep our percentage growth for

247
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:41,030
sales tax flat.

248
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,046
This estimate reflect an improvement to the economic conditions compared to fiscal

249
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:50,826
year 2021 which was severely impacted by COVID-19

250
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:54,794
Pandemic which affected our national and global

251
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:58,074
economy. So although the energy sector

252
00:16:58,122 --> 00:17:02,250
has contributed significantly to the Houston economy, the ongoing volatility

253
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,086
of the Russian's invasions of Ukraine has caused uncertainties among

254
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:10,274
the oil industry. So current average oil price is

255
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:14,082
at 109.77 per barrel. This is as of May

256
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:17,926
6. So therefore the proposed budget assumes no growth from

257
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:19,910
the fiscal year 22 estimates.

258
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,158
And when we look at Dr.

259
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,950
Gilmer which is our consultants on the sales tax and the economists

260
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,350
who's from the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the UFH,

261
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,906
he projected the fiscal year 23 range for the

262
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:41,110
city sales tax ranging from the low of 773 to

263
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,478
812,000,000. So we are somewhat in the middle at

264
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:50,058
this point. Again, it's a lot of moving factors

265
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,742
going forward. So we want to be conservative and just we leave it as

266
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:57,234
flat at this point from fiscal year 22 estimates we had seen,

267
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:00,418
of course, as you all see it every single month are projecting increasing in

268
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:03,874
the sales tax as we receive more receipts in

269
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:07,414
this year. But again, we don't know what we don't know.

270
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,640
So we want to leave it flat at this time.

271
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,870
Next slide. Okay, so this is the trends on the sales tax.

272
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,910
Again, sales tax is very volatile.

273
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,958
It changes very quickly as the economy

274
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,782
shifted. You see what happened with the Pandemic.

275
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:29,670
So with the drop in state home, so that revenues which

276
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,946
would decrease tremendously. So again comparison

277
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:37,326
from fiscal year 19 where we are at

278
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:38,720
with our sales tax.

279
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,970
So now we're moving on to the John Fund expenditures.

280
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,602
So again, this is the net change from fiscal year 20

281
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:55,510
to current budget. So we are reflecting about 3.85%

282
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,506
increase in the general fund of 2.7 billion compared

283
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,558
to the 2.6 billion major

284
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:08,070
changes we have in there is on the operating budget.

285
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,382
Again, it includes the employee compensations.

286
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,666
So that is an increase of 44.6 million. So that is

287
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:18,810
on the fire, police and municipal pay raises also

288
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,426
have the surface chargeback funds. This is restricted accounts

289
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:26,414
of 18.35 million health benefits

290
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,366
includes about 14.7 million

291
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:33,934
increases in here other surface

292
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:37,186
chargeback and I know we put that note in there is for

293
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:41,060
the contract escalations and new facility operating cost

294
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,978
we also project some savings in this

295
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:49,094
proposed budget, mainly on the pension. So you

296
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:52,710
see the pension and note four showing a

297
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,454
reduction of 2.3 million. This is because of the rate changes from

298
00:19:56,492 --> 00:20:00,134
the midpoint to the minimum point for the fire pension

299
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:03,900
as they are falling below the minimum corridor at this point.

300
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,074
And also deferral. If you recall our

301
00:20:08,112 --> 00:20:12,010
budget in fiscal year 2000 and 22,021 includes

302
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,934
deferral for the Walker lease building. So now

303
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:19,166
we don't have deferral anymore. So we only pay what

304
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:23,140
we are owed on an annual basis. So that shows some saving

305
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,674
on the debt service and payers to go, it increased by 22.6

306
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:32,574
million. Again, some of that is pertaining to the captured

307
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:36,210
revenues pay go as increase in the CPIs

308
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,622
included in that calculation as well and

309
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:43,554
also transfer of the debt service. Now this does not include

310
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:47,442
any prepayment from the building inspections. If you recall our previous

311
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:51,222
budget includes debt prepayment for the building inspection funds.

312
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:54,774
So this is not including that. So you will see some of those uptick

313
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:58,506
because of no longer debt prepayment from the building inspections included in

314
00:20:58,528 --> 00:21:01,710
this debt service transfers.

315
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,494
Next slide. Okay,

316
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:10,778
again, this is just a comparison of the allocated

317
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:14,546
general fund expenditures including debt service from fiscal year 23

318
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:18,414
to fiscal year 22. Again, public safety still remains

319
00:21:18,462 --> 00:21:22,260
the bulk of the compositions in the general fund.

320
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,930
Police and fire alone is at $1.55 billion.

321
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,854
So compared to this $2.7 billion proposed budget, police and fire

322
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:34,790
alone includes about 56.4% of the total budget.

323
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,646
Another one that I want to point out in here is the

324
00:21:38,668 --> 00:21:42,810
debt service or the debt service which is pledged

325
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,706
with the property tax revenues that we have is about 13%

326
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:51,430
of our general fund budget.

327
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,146
3% is the pay as you go and you see the remaining

328
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:58,666
is those other departments including

329
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:02,670
Solid Waste. I think Solid Waste is in one of those other departments.

330
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,490
Next slides.

331
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,170
So this is the compositions of the personnel versus non personnel.

332
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,200
Now overall again our general fund,

333
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,134
62% is personnel, I know we kind of

334
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:25,442
mentioned that earlier, 62% is personnel,

335
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:29,606
38% is in others. Out of that 62 personnel,

336
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:33,740
76 of that is classified police and fire.

337
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,690
Only 24% is civilians. Again,

338
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,346
going back to the others portion of the 38% debt

339
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:46,094
service is about 42%. You have the energy costs in there and

340
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,790
other service and chargeback.

341
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,910
Next slide.

342
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,414
So this is a slide just to go through the general fund pension contributions.

343
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:03,086
I know Mayor had mentioned the pension reform was done in 2017.

344
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:07,762
So from the unfunded liability point of view, the pension reform in 2017

345
00:23:07,826 --> 00:23:11,814
reduced the projected unfunded liability from 8.2 billion to

346
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:16,130
1.5 billion. That is reduction about 6.7 billion

347
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,802
from the liability point of view. But what you see in here

348
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:24,890
in this chart is the projected city pension contributions

349
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,934
without the reform. So if you look at this, the shaded

350
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:32,894
area in there without the reform we would have had to set

351
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:36,746
aside another 1.4 billion on the operating funds

352
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:38,910
to pay for those city contributions.

353
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,606
Again, the full impact from stiscalyte 18 on

354
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:49,170
the city general fund contribution is about 1.4 billion,

355
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,810
if not because of the pension reform.

356
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,318
Next slide so finally, this is

357
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:59,494
the general fund unassigned ending fund balance. So as

358
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:04,360
mentioned, so we are now at 13.46% 13.5%.

359
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,262
We are at 310.7

360
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:12,730
million fund balance. So that is about $138,000,000

361
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,586
above the 7.5%. But one thing I do want to note in

362
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:19,926
here, the fiscal year 22 and the

363
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,914
fiscal year 23 fund balance in here includes ARPA

364
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,910
funding that is not recurring.

365
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,942
So I cannot stress enough on the important

366
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:34,494
to preserve fund balance because of what's coming ahead in fiscal year

367
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:37,850
25. Another thing to put in here, fiscal year

368
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,514
18 amount requires 7.5%. Fund balance is adjusted to exclude the

369
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:46,374
910,000,000 pension obligation bond. This is back in fiscal year

370
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:49,270
18. Next slide.

371
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,870
So now we're moving to the general fund five year forecast.

372
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,062
Again, this is a forecast which has some assumptions

373
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:05,414
in the next five years at this point, but hopefully

374
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,154
it would give some ideas of where we're going to be in the next five

375
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:11,754
years. Again, this projected gap range

376
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,370
based on the conservative and optimistic

377
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,654
growth in revenues, it does not include any one

378
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:22,702
time land sales for our revenues property

379
00:25:22,756 --> 00:25:26,670
tax revenues. It is in compliance with Propositions One and Eight limitations

380
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,122
holding. The senior disabled exemptions at 160,000 and

381
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:35,258
the pension assumption is based on and this is to be corrected

382
00:25:35,454 --> 00:25:38,886
based on either minimum or midpoint of

383
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:43,090
the corridor because of the conditions of those pension groups

384
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,966
on the expenditures. Also includes legal mandates, staffing for

385
00:25:46,988 --> 00:25:51,162
new facilities and contractual escalators starting

386
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,530
with the revenues. Next slide.

387
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,918
So I've talked about what is in the assumptions

388
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:03,450
for the fiscal year 23 proposed budget. So roughly,

389
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,262
property tax growth is about 4%. Again, the driver of that

390
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,814
is the CPI is the CPI growth rate.

391
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:14,174
We have not including any populations growth rate.

392
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:17,906
So this is still based on the 0% populations which will be

393
00:26:17,928 --> 00:26:22,354
updated once we have this data by the end of May. Again, sales tax

394
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:25,670
growth rates in fiscal year 23 remain flat.

395
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,474
Franchise fees overall its reduction

396
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:33,346
of 1.2%. Again, bulk of that is the telephone franchise fees

397
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:37,186
that continues to decline. We also have other revenue

398
00:26:37,218 --> 00:26:41,574
growth at 3.7%. This is on the Industrial Assessment

399
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:45,702
license and permits as we have seen some revenue increases

400
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:49,242
in fiscal year 22 as the economy started to pick up and

401
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:52,606
no one time land sales in here. So you see the

402
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:56,574
projection from fiscal year 24 to 27, which is

403
00:26:56,612 --> 00:27:00,110
based on the low and the high for our assumptions.

404
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,350
Next slide.

405
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,054
On the expenditure side, again, we've gone through

406
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:13,054
the fiscal year 23 assumptions. Police is

407
00:27:13,092 --> 00:27:16,334
based on a 4% increase, fire is

408
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:20,046
based on a 6% increase, pay raises, municipal Employees

409
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:24,066
is based on a 3% increase and

410
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:27,838
we've gone through the pension contributions for fiscal

411
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,474
year 23 which is known at this point, is at the

412
00:27:31,512 --> 00:27:35,030
8.44 for Hmaps which is based on the midpoint.

413
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,206
Again, we also have the legacy pension that

414
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:41,558
we have to pay to Hmaps at 142,000,000.

415
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:45,306
H Pops is based on

416
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:48,410
31.98, which is the midpoint at this point,

417
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,186
and the Fire pension at 26.89 which

418
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:55,526
is at the minimum point of the corridor.

419
00:27:55,718 --> 00:27:58,990
We have the growth assumption for health benefits at 4%,

420
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,686
which is known at this point. And again the debt service and pays you

421
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:06,894
go as described earlier. Now going to fiscal year 24

422
00:28:06,932 --> 00:28:10,114
to 27, this is our assumptions going forward.

423
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:14,398
We know what has already been in the meet and confer

424
00:28:14,574 --> 00:28:18,642
with police which is 3% 24 and 3.5%

425
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:22,302
25. So we're not using any assumptions

426
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:26,182
in the future at this point, which is at TBD. At this point Fire

427
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:29,634
is 6% in 24 and TBD.

428
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:33,354
So we just remain at that point for these assumptions and

429
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:37,770
another 3% in 24 for municipal employees.

430
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,442
Again, H maps for 24 to 27

431
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:44,730
is based on the midpoint of corridor.

432
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,974
Police and Fire is going to be looking at the

433
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:54,334
minimum. So we have a range of minimum and midpoint because

434
00:28:54,372 --> 00:28:57,774
they are getting close to the minimum corridor. So we are making

435
00:28:57,812 --> 00:29:01,166
some assumptions at this point because it's still a moving number. So we're

436
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:05,122
making this range for police and Fire again

437
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:09,010
on the health benefits because it's still assumptions going forward. We also do

438
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,966
a range on the growth for the health benefits five

439
00:29:14,008 --> 00:29:17,686
to 7% and the debt service of course is based on

440
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:21,414
our debt service models which is planned payment for

441
00:29:21,452 --> 00:29:25,386
the next five years. So with that we go

442
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:28,874
to the next slide so we could map this out and take a look

443
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:32,506
at what the gap is going to look

444
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:33,980
like. Next slide, please.

445
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,222
So this is roughly what we're looking at in the next five years.

446
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:44,110
Keep in mind this does not include ARPA funding

447
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,098
so I don't want to skew our visibility

448
00:29:49,194 --> 00:29:52,126
with mixing the ARPA funding in these discussions.

449
00:29:52,318 --> 00:29:56,526
As you see in fiscal year 23 you have about $160,000,000

450
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,570
gap so that's what ARPA funding came in and fiscal

451
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,242
year 24 does not include ARPA fundings in this scenario

452
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:07,938
as well. So that is something that we will be incorporating

453
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:11,778
in next fiscal year and going forward you

454
00:30:11,804 --> 00:30:16,374
have an idea what our range of gap

455
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:20,262
looks like. Again, this is not using any utilizations

456
00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:24,650
of ARPA funding. Next slide.

457
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,590
So let's take a look back and see

458
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,366
what have we done as a city. I know you've all seen

459
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:38,240
the PFM studies and so I do want to

460
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:42,066
put forth what has been done to see where

461
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:44,882
we are at today because if this is not done then we would have been

462
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:48,846
in a much worse situations at this point. So one thing's

463
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:52,054
first of course is the pension reform that was done 2017. You saw

464
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:56,486
what the impact if that was not done in

465
00:30:56,508 --> 00:31:00,354
that city contributions and unfunded liabilities, OPAP reform.

466
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,530
So we had seen some reductions in the unfunded liabilities.

467
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,086
Shared services we have done on the joint processing

468
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:11,050
center. We have shared services with the Harris County,

469
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,794
of course, continuing hiring control through the Mayor

470
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:19,386
staffing Efficiencies program. You've seen all the claw

471
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:22,494
back provisions that we had implemented a couple

472
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:26,362
of years ago. You've seen the EMSC

473
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,354
adjustments that went to council several years ago as well.

474
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:34,366
And of course the health benefits update, negotiated Cdwat

475
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,206
medical and prescriptions benefits plans, implemented Spousal surcharge

476
00:31:38,238 --> 00:31:41,950
if you've all seen it, and also perform the dependent eligibility

477
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:45,526
audit and there's maybe other stuff that has been done. So these are

478
00:31:45,548 --> 00:31:49,014
the major items that I do want to highlight before we go to the next

479
00:31:49,052 --> 00:31:51,910
slides. Next slide.

480
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,946
So again, what's next? Again, it's important to understand

481
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:59,382
what we work with at this point. We do have the limitations

482
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:02,922
on the property tax revenue cap, in city charter and

483
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:06,302
state cap. So not just the city's local cap,

484
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:09,680
but there's also state cap that we have to work and comply with.

485
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,790
Another limitation is public safety. It is something

486
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,034
to note that police and fire costs make up about 57%

487
00:32:18,072 --> 00:32:21,694
of the general fund and also COVID impact.

488
00:32:21,742 --> 00:32:25,234
So which is the economic uncertainties that we are dealing with

489
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:28,802
at this point. COVID and of course what happened

490
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:32,594
in Russian invasions to Ukraine. So that would impact

491
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:36,070
the oil prices, again, the volatility in the economy.

492
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,566
So on the short terms, it is important for

493
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:44,646
us to build and preserve fund balance. Again, to be conservative,

494
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,934
continue to leverage ARPA funding, to address revenue losses, continue hiring

495
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:52,406
control and also look for efficiencies and cost cutting

496
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:56,414
opportunities, developing new revenue sources. And I

497
00:32:56,612 --> 00:32:59,710
briefly mentioned that in the press conference yesterday.

498
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,850
And again continue working day one to build the fund balance

499
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,940
as we had into fiscal year 23, 24 and 25.

500
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,730
In the long terms, again, continue to look into those

501
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,442
implementing PFM recommendations that are supported by both

502
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:19,154
mayor and yourself, city Council in

503
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:22,694
which one of that, as you had seen in the past, is the outcome based

504
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:26,360
budgeting. So we are in the progress to do that.

505
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,806
And so with that we have an

506
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:34,040
update on the outcome based budgeting and I would refer to

507
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,330
Deputy Director William Jones.

508
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,466
All right. Thank you, Director. And to Mayor Pro TEM and

509
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:45,318
Council. Time to switch pace a little bit, talk about something a little

510
00:33:45,344 --> 00:33:48,686
fun, at least it is to me. So this is a project I've been

511
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:54,846
very close to since this

512
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,898
is a project I've been close to since about 2011 twelve.

513
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:01,940
We've been making small incremental progress throughout the years,

514
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,970
but now I'm excited that we've actually launched this project.

515
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,522
So last summer we kicked off phase one of the outcome based

516
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:12,520
budgeting project. So if you can bring up the slides please.

517
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,334
Okay, so in phase one, it was

518
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:20,598
essentially a discovery phase. So we brought in the consultant to come in

519
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:24,154
and look at our process, look at our systems, look at our technology,

520
00:34:24,352 --> 00:34:27,658
and do an assessment. And with that,

521
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:31,418
we had a lot of workshops with the departments. And like I said,

522
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:34,934
throughout the years we had already been working with the departments,

523
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:38,606
making what progress we could on what our programs and how

524
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:41,550
do we start looking at our budget a little differently.

525
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,626
From phase one, we conducted 45 workshops.

526
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:50,606
We had over 100 plus participants. All 26 departments participated,

527
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:54,126
and we were able to identify hundreds of programs.

528
00:34:54,318 --> 00:34:58,286
And we also looked at some different vendors on some technology solutions.

529
00:34:58,318 --> 00:35:01,846
So phase one was a very successful phase. So when

530
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:05,560
you look at what does it mean to

531
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,262
implement it successfully, what do we have to do? So we focused on three

532
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,880
key things the people, technology and process.

533
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,786
So those are some of the findings and recommendations that we looked at.

534
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:21,114
So when you look at the people, one of the most important things

535
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,522
is to have buy in at the very top, at the very top level

536
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:27,338
with the mayor. And we definitely have to buy in from the mayor. One of

537
00:35:27,344 --> 00:35:30,734
the first things he did when he came in the office is signed Executive Order

538
00:35:30,772 --> 00:35:34,394
150, which pretty much outlined a performance

539
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:38,126
based budget model that the city would move towards. And we also

540
00:35:38,148 --> 00:35:41,634
have buy in from council. I know Councilman Alcorn has been very involved with it.

541
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:44,146
We had an amendment, I want to say a couple of years ago that we

542
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:47,700
would start that discovery phase. So we did complete that.

543
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,142
And then not only at the top level, we have to have engagement

544
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:56,246
with the employees, the managers, the people that are actually doing the work.

545
00:35:56,428 --> 00:35:59,926
And again, we've been doing that. So we want to keep

546
00:35:59,948 --> 00:36:03,174
that momentum that we've had throughout the year. So even with this

547
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:06,314
budget, I work with departments to make sure they are thinking

548
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:09,834
about their budget in terms of programs, have them start

549
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:13,194
thinking of how they would measure those things. And I'll show you a really good

550
00:36:13,232 --> 00:36:16,800
example later in this presentation. So people is very important.

551
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:21,082
Also technology. One of the things I found throughout

552
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:24,874
my time of reviewing outcome based budget and performance

553
00:36:24,922 --> 00:36:28,586
based budget is that technology was a huge barrier for a lot of cities.

554
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:31,858
I think now is the perfect time that the technology

555
00:36:31,944 --> 00:36:35,486
has advanced so much in the past five years. A lot of cloud based solutions,

556
00:36:35,518 --> 00:36:38,850
a lot of solutions that will allow us to track performance.

557
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,382
And I presented with TTI, I think last month, along with his

558
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:46,934
department, that we have found a solution that may

559
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:49,926
work for us. So the technology,

560
00:36:50,028 --> 00:36:53,234
like I said, is a very important part. And we've made a lot of progress.

561
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:56,282
The industry has made a lot of progress on that front.

562
00:36:56,416 --> 00:37:00,422
And probably one of. The most important thing is the process. So that's

563
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:04,118
one of the key things we focused on, making sure because it's

564
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:07,674
a major shift for the city to go from the incremental based budgeting

565
00:37:07,722 --> 00:37:11,562
to looking more at performance and focusing on outcomes.

566
00:37:11,706 --> 00:37:14,654
So process is one of the things we're going to spend a lot of time

567
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:18,162
on in the second phase. Next slide please.

568
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:21,678
So what's next? So the next phase,

569
00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:25,540
one of the first things, like I said, is focusing on the process.

570
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,980
So redesign and introduce our budget process,

571
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,746
starting with the strategic plan. So one of the major differences with outcome

572
00:37:33,778 --> 00:37:36,614
based budget is you start with your strategic plan,

573
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:39,974
what are the outcomes that the citizens expect, what are the

574
00:37:40,012 --> 00:37:43,654
priorities of the city, and then we

575
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:47,246
build from there. So we build our budget knowing what those goals

576
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,474
are so that you know how to prioritize your budget and build

577
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:53,578
your budget from the ground up. So in this next phase, it's going to be

578
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:57,530
very important that we developed our process, document our process,

579
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,270
change our budget calendar. We have to look at what new forms do

580
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,494
we need to create. So that's going to be to me one of the most

581
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,886
important process before we even get to the system, because you don't want

582
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:10,590
to get a system and then you're still trying to figure out your process.

583
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,794
You want to get a system, have your process in place and transition all

584
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:17,234
that over first. So we're going to focus on process first and then you see

585
00:38:17,272 --> 00:38:20,934
on the second bullet, then we're going to look at implementing a

586
00:38:20,972 --> 00:38:24,726
comprehensive budget solution so that's the technology and the

587
00:38:24,748 --> 00:38:27,926
system that I talked about. And when you look

588
00:38:27,948 --> 00:38:31,574
at bullet point number three, then we integrate all

589
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:35,594
of those solutions together, the process with the system and

590
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:39,402
making sure everything works together. And then on number four,

591
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:43,178
again, as I said, one of the most important things is people making sure that

592
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:46,666
the employees, the managers, understand their role in this new budgeting

593
00:38:46,698 --> 00:38:50,750
format, understand that we need to track performance.

594
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,274
A lot of departments already do it, but it doesn't drive decisions.

595
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:58,314
So we're going to need to change that mentality to make sure that they're tracking

596
00:38:58,362 --> 00:39:02,158
performance for the outcomes that we expect and that we're monitoring

597
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:06,126
those and measuring those. And then again, redefine the talent, provide staff

598
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:09,362
with the support and resources that they need to be able to do that.

599
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:12,914
This is not an easy thing and from what I've seen with other cities,

600
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:16,866
they do have challenges. So we need to make sure that the staff

601
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:20,886
has the support that they need to be able to track the

602
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:24,774
goals and build the budget and have that buy in

603
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:29,290
from the leadership to know that we're all moving in the same direction.

604
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,690
Okay, so the next slide. So this is the one I really wanted to focus

605
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,358
on to show you some of the work that we've done. So this is real

606
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:40,078
data that we did with the Hits department. So it's a

607
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:43,374
prototype, but it's based on real data. So we

608
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:47,054
took their revolving fund budget, which is 98.1

609
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:50,466
million. So what they did, if you look at the very bottom, you'll see the

610
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:54,094
programs. So we identified about 13 programs

611
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:58,034
within the Hits department. So if you're looking at it, you can see how much

612
00:39:58,072 --> 00:40:01,790
more relevant that the data is here. When you're looking at the budget,

613
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,702
you can see looking at the first one citywide customer service,

614
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:09,158
three one one program. People may not know that the

615
00:40:09,164 --> 00:40:12,822
Hits involvement with the Three One one program. And when we look at it from

616
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:16,578
a global perspective, well, you know, three one one is in Ara as

617
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:20,154
well. And then the goal is to be able to show how much are we

618
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:23,642
spending on three one one. Then you start measuring what is the call

619
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:27,206
time, how long does it take to respond, and then you can start measuring that

620
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:30,766
to see, okay, are we performing accurately or do

621
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:35,086
we need to put more money there or do we need to reassess? And then

622
00:40:35,188 --> 00:40:38,746
how long does it take for responses to be responded

623
00:40:38,778 --> 00:40:42,050
to by other departments? But until we have it's difficult

624
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,458
to see in our current budget. But if we have program called Three one One

625
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:48,770
that crosses other departments and we can see the total cost

626
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,066
of what it is to run a three one one program, then we can

627
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:55,606
make better decisions on how we fund those programs. So like

628
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:59,046
I said, altogether it's about 13 programs there. And then you

629
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:02,582
go up to the next level. Now we're going to tie those

630
00:41:02,636 --> 00:41:06,066
programs into the priorities because right now, we don't know how much we're spending

631
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:09,082
on the priorities of the city. So that'll be one of the big changes.

632
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,570
And then you go up to the next level, and then we tie it to

633
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,534
the plan. Houston, the core strategies, that the citizen

634
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:19,886
survey, that what they expect. Right now, we can't tell them how much are

635
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:23,930
we spending on sustaining quality infrastructure.

636
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,214
Like I said, right now we're just looking at Hits. But once

637
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:31,326
we get this entire thing up and running, then we can provide the citizens

638
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,314
with better data to be able to understand where their dollars are going and

639
00:41:35,352 --> 00:41:39,406
also provide council with better information on how we can make decisions

640
00:41:39,438 --> 00:41:44,098
and fund these things. So like I said, I'm very excited that we've

641
00:41:44,114 --> 00:41:47,718
kicked this project off officially. Phase two is going to like it's going to

642
00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:51,560
be a challenge. So the goal is we're still aiming for FY 24

643
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,174
with the hopes of for sure having the process in place.

644
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:58,378
Now, the system may take a little more time,

645
00:41:58,544 --> 00:42:01,722
but like I said, the process is the most important part.

646
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:04,874
But we're definitely going to get a system, but without the process,

647
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:08,654
to me, the system can wait, but we're moving forward with both.

648
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:12,320
So by FY 24, we'll have some form of

649
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,760
outcome based budgeting to present to you guys.

650
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,126
So on the next slide, and this just shows you kind of

651
00:42:20,148 --> 00:42:23,954
how our reporting would look taking that same data with hits, you can see,

652
00:42:23,992 --> 00:42:27,538
you get the program description, what are the goals of that program,

653
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:31,074
and then you'll see now we're starting to put measures tying it to

654
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:34,582
those programs. And then throughout the year, we would have to track,

655
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:38,360
are we hitting those targets? If not, then what do we need to do?

656
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,762
So it's a different way of looking at your budget,

657
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:45,574
not focusing on how much do we spend on this department, how much

658
00:42:45,612 --> 00:42:48,698
do we spend on that department, but what are the programs that we're providing to

659
00:42:48,704 --> 00:42:51,978
the citizens and how are they performing. So my hope is that

660
00:42:52,144 --> 00:42:55,834
not only do we change, provide the citizens with

661
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:59,158
better information on how their dollars are being spent, but also kind

662
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:02,510
of change how council can look at the budget and get away from

663
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,950
the little line items here and there and the department spending there, and focus

664
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,678
on those programs and start paying attention to what we're

665
00:43:09,694 --> 00:43:13,122
measuring. Okay,

666
00:43:13,176 --> 00:43:16,466
I think that's it for that. So before I turn it over

667
00:43:16,488 --> 00:43:19,754
to questions, I do want to take a moment to recognize

668
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:23,474
my team. I had them put on their Sunday's Best in March

669
00:43:23,522 --> 00:43:27,030
over here. So I'm going to ask them to stand up, team.

670
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,720
Stand up, all of you.

671
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,258
These are the people that work nights and weekends

672
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:39,658
to get this budget done. And all I had to do is bribe them with

673
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:42,986
a little food and they put in the work. So to say

674
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:46,090
I'm proud of them would be a huge understatement.

675
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,074
And I've had the highest number of vacancies I've ever had going into a budget

676
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:54,042
cycle, so they did triple the workload. And I am extremely

677
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:56,560
proud of this group here. So thank you guys.

678
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,650
The last 15 years I've been with the city, I think this is the least

679
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,478
amount of teams we have to do the budget.

680
00:44:08,574 --> 00:44:11,800
So I'm very proud. Thank you so much.

681
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,462
Retention. Retention. So we will burn people and they actually

682
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:18,920
leave. That's what we have.

683
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,950
You guys ready for questions? Yes. All right, you got the easy part

684
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,598
over with. Here comes the tough part. So council member Sally Alcorn

685
00:44:28,614 --> 00:44:32,486
will start us off. Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. And I did notice a slight

686
00:44:32,598 --> 00:44:36,560
uptick in the food line item for the Finance Department. Now I know why,

687
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,926
but that's money well spent. And thank you guys for a great job. This is

688
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:44,638
a really huge undertaking and

689
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:48,542
will thank you for all the attention to outcome based

690
00:44:48,596 --> 00:44:52,450
budgeting. I just think that's going to be key to look at our

691
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,306
programs and services that we provide. It's very difficult to see

692
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:59,826
that in our current budget structure, and I think that will really help us to

693
00:44:59,848 --> 00:45:03,234
prioritize. So very happy about that. I'll just run through a few

694
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:06,582
questions really quick. It's my understanding the $160,000,000

695
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:10,246
of ARPA funding that's being put in the 23 budget as part

696
00:45:10,268 --> 00:45:12,280
of the first tranche of money, correct?

697
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,606
Correct. Okay. And the next tranche of money, you had a slide

698
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:21,354
on there that says we must have this. Is it just committed by

699
00:45:21,392 --> 00:45:25,050
2024, end of 2024 and spent then by

700
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,702
2026, obligated by 24.

701
00:45:28,836 --> 00:45:31,966
Obligated by 24 and spent by end of

702
00:45:31,988 --> 00:45:35,962
year 2026. Yes. Okay. Thank you. On the inflation

703
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:39,582
rate, you mentioned that a 4.8%

704
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:43,010
number and a 4.28% number 4.28.

705
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,134
Okay. So for purposes of the rev,

706
00:45:45,182 --> 00:45:49,010
Captain, it's 4.28. The 4.8

707
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,774
I misspoke. So I corrected myself. I get the four and the eight,

708
00:45:52,812 --> 00:45:55,302
but it's 4.28%. Okay.

709
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:59,362
So we operate under the lesser of that inflation

710
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:03,420
rate plus population, or four and a half percent. So right now

711
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,494
we'd still be under CPI plus population when calculating

712
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:11,514
that. Okay, thank you. And on

713
00:46:11,552 --> 00:46:15,334
the senior

714
00:46:15,382 --> 00:46:19,550
exemption, the 160,000 that the mayor announced would be going to 260,000.

715
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,694
I believe that's not an assumption in the plan

716
00:46:23,812 --> 00:46:27,738
for this year. When would that kick in or

717
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:31,842
have an effect? Right. So the senior tax

718
00:46:31,896 --> 00:46:35,982
exemptions and disabled will be in effect starting July

719
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:36,660
1.

720
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:43,046
So that is not going to be impacting the budget because the budget is just

721
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:46,802
based on the revenues. So that would be impacting

722
00:46:46,866 --> 00:46:50,306
the citizens when we actually look at the tax rates.

723
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,294
Right. So they would have some savings. Got it. So that

724
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:57,786
doesn't have any correct. Okay. In here. And then on

725
00:46:57,808 --> 00:47:01,146
the Hmeps legacy contribution, can you explain that

726
00:47:01,168 --> 00:47:05,262
again? I think you briefly touched on there were two categories on your assumptions for

727
00:47:05,316 --> 00:47:08,990
pensions. One was the legacy and one was just a

728
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,686
rate. Can you? Yeah. So remember

729
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,400
in that pension reform, one of the

730
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,674
item that came out of that Senate bill on

731
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:24,338
the municipal pensions, it's actually two

732
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:28,734
portions. So there is a legacy amount which is based on a dollar agreement

733
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:32,374
on the dollars payment for out years. Okay. And also a

734
00:47:32,412 --> 00:47:35,462
percent rate. Yeah, now I remember.

735
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:39,334
Right. But not going to fire in pension is just based on

736
00:47:39,532 --> 00:47:41,720
the corridor midpoint. Thank you.

737
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,890
Council member Abby Cayman.

738
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:54,266
Sorry we're having to share Mikes. Director, thank you

739
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:59,226
for your presentation to the entire team concerned

740
00:47:59,258 --> 00:48:02,606
about but for ARPA, where we would be in

741
00:48:02,628 --> 00:48:05,966
the projections and the gaps that you're showing in

742
00:48:05,988 --> 00:48:09,986
some of those slides, it's extremely concerning. Do we know

743
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:12,980
and you may have already said this, but just for the public,

744
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:19,794
how many projected dollars were not captured due to the

745
00:48:19,832 --> 00:48:23,666
revenue limitations in the cap that are currently in

746
00:48:23,688 --> 00:48:24,260
place?

747
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,886
Thank you for bringing that up on slide 15. So that is

748
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,160
the impact on the revenue cap.

749
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:37,066
So the impact for fiscal year 23,

750
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:40,650
if we don't have a cap, it would have been about 282,000,000

751
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,958
that we could have used to serve

752
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:48,230
the city. So that is one of the items

753
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:51,866
in your statements. So the other one is, if not for ARPA,

754
00:48:51,898 --> 00:48:55,038
then essentially you would have about $160,000,000 gap to close,

755
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:58,254
which could impact public safety. And it was

756
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:01,442
also striking on page 17 that since

757
00:49:01,496 --> 00:49:05,250
fiscal year 2015, the full impact of the property tax

758
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,354
cap has been 1.818 excuse me,

759
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:11,080
billion dollars. So thank you for providing that.

760
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,590
You started to emphasize it, but with the fund balance,

761
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:20,178
how important is that to preserve,

762
00:49:20,354 --> 00:49:23,846
especially with the revenue losses that we've experienced

763
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:27,226
during the Pandemic? Very. Thank you for bringing that

764
00:49:27,248 --> 00:49:31,334
up. Very. Because if you remember, what we have from ARPA

765
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:34,886
is essentially to replenish the revenue we lost.

766
00:49:35,078 --> 00:49:37,982
So it's not something that now that we have the money,

767
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:42,062
then this is the money that we spent today. But those are enough to

768
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:45,102
recover the revenue losses we have. And again,

769
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:48,142
ARPA is going to be ending in December 31,

770
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:51,778
2024. And so that money is not going to be available.

771
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:55,394
So the hope is that the economy would be picking up back

772
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:58,626
again at that point. So it is very important for us

773
00:49:58,648 --> 00:50:01,438
to preserve the sun balance at this point. We'll put you back in queue.

774
00:50:01,534 --> 00:50:04,866
Thank you, Council Member Plumber and then Council Member Martin,

775
00:50:04,978 --> 00:50:07,926
thank you so much for all the work that everyone has done. I know this

776
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:11,062
is tough. So,

777
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:14,378
a couple of questions. I know we talked about

778
00:50:14,464 --> 00:50:16,940
the impact of the cap, the revenue cap.

779
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,666
Is that money completely gone

780
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,786
or is that money injected to the

781
00:50:23,808 --> 00:50:27,946
city in other ways, through management districts, to other avenues,

782
00:50:27,978 --> 00:50:30,000
or is that just not it's not.

783
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,206
So remember when

784
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:40,066
we hit the revenue, the property tax revenue cap back in fiscal year

785
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:43,394
15, we actually have to set our

786
00:50:43,432 --> 00:50:47,534
general fund budget at the cap, which translate

787
00:50:47,662 --> 00:50:51,286
when you actually go through the truth and taxations and voting for the

788
00:50:51,308 --> 00:50:54,518
tax rate to meet that revenue cap,

789
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:58,386
we would have to adjust our tax rates. So it's

790
00:50:58,418 --> 00:51:02,474
lost because essentially we have to reduce the tax rate to be at

791
00:51:02,512 --> 00:51:03,660
the revenue cap.

792
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,780
Okay, and then the other two more questions.

793
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:13,146
I really appreciate how you listed in

794
00:51:13,168 --> 00:51:16,294
more detail what we did in terms of implementing the PFM

795
00:51:16,342 --> 00:51:20,454
report. Do you have an idea and I know this is totally an approximation,

796
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:22,990
and maybe you don't even know, but do you have an idea what that number

797
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:27,306
collectively would look like dollar

798
00:51:27,338 --> 00:51:30,606
wise? Dollar wise? No, we don't. Because it has to

799
00:51:30,628 --> 00:51:34,114
ask for individual calculations with the no,

800
00:51:34,152 --> 00:51:36,770
we don't. I'm just curious to see we spent so much money on that report.

801
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,534
I would just be curious to see what savings,

802
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:42,498
how we benefited from making those adjustments.

803
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:46,006
Well, you could see already with the pension reform yeah,

804
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:49,586
no, we have that. With the OPEC reform, you get the impact

805
00:51:49,618 --> 00:51:53,238
on what the potential reductions in unfunded liabilities

806
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:57,322
in there. Health benefits. I think that would reduce our health

807
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:00,220
benefits and I think that was presented earlier as well.

808
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:05,226
That would reduce our cost this year because of the health

809
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,966
benefits. I definitely see the benefit. I just would love to know what the number

810
00:52:07,988 --> 00:52:11,034
was collectively. Okay, we'll put you back in queue.

811
00:52:11,082 --> 00:52:15,086
Okay, so I'm going to go to slide 29.

812
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:18,782
Okay, what's next,

813
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:22,070
addressing the gap? The reason why I'm bringing this up is three of us sitting

814
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,426
around here are leaving. This is our second to last budget, and you're going

815
00:52:25,448 --> 00:52:28,706
to be in charge of the next couple of budgets. And while we

816
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,642
have a really good picture this year, we have an abysmal picture after

817
00:52:32,696 --> 00:52:36,034
we leave. And I'm going to point that out short term,

818
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:39,526
building up fund balance. Yeah, we're going to continue to do that.

819
00:52:39,548 --> 00:52:44,178
You do that by all these initiatives hiring control, creating efficiencies,

820
00:52:44,354 --> 00:52:47,974
cost cutting opportunity. That means increasing revenue

821
00:52:48,022 --> 00:52:51,466
sources. That's taxes and fees, continuing one day to build

822
00:52:51,488 --> 00:52:54,926
fund balance. So the really number one thing is build fund balance. How do you

823
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:58,782
do that? So I'm going to go to page

824
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:00,960
26,

825
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,218
and there was a question that was asked of me last week to prepare

826
00:53:06,234 --> 00:53:10,542
for this. And the person said, dave, how much of our retirement

827
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:13,774
pay, our defined benefit pay that we pay employees,

828
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:17,214
is included in OPEB other post employment

829
00:53:17,262 --> 00:53:19,620
benefits? Does anybody know the answer to that?

830
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:25,350
Zero. OPEB has nothing to do with

831
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,470
retirement pay. It has everything to do mainly with health care,

832
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:32,374
disability and things of that nature. And the vernacular and the the

833
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:35,914
verbiage around here is always around OPEB. OPEB has

834
00:53:35,952 --> 00:53:39,338
nothing to do with our big bugaboo, that's retirement pay.

835
00:53:39,504 --> 00:53:42,618
And if you look at slide 26,

836
00:53:42,704 --> 00:53:46,158
correct me if I'm wrong, the retirement pay that we're going

837
00:53:46,164 --> 00:53:50,190
to pay this year in this budget is $436,000,000.

838
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,440
Is that correct,

839
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:58,686
yes or no? No. The 436 is the debt

840
00:53:58,718 --> 00:54:02,114
payment. Where is the

841
00:54:02,152 --> 00:54:05,806
retirement pay that we're obligated to pay for retirees in fiscal

842
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,554
year 2023? Because I looked through this big book

843
00:54:09,592 --> 00:54:13,150
and all I can find is debt and pay as you go.

844
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,214
Is it in here? It should be in the health benefits,

845
00:54:16,412 --> 00:54:19,478
yeah. Okay. I'm looking for a number because I

846
00:54:19,484 --> 00:54:22,760
looked through it and I couldn't find it. So it's a big number.

847
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:27,066
It's a big number. I think it's not as

848
00:54:27,088 --> 00:54:30,746
big as police, not as big as fire. That's one and two. But I think

849
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:34,518
it's the third largest expenditure that we will have to pay. Correct me

850
00:54:34,544 --> 00:54:36,720
if I'm wrong. Out of the general fund,

851
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:42,042
we do have this breakdown on the retirees classified

852
00:54:42,106 --> 00:54:45,550
in civilians, so we can provide it to you.

853
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,922
What is the number? I want a number to everyone to hear because

854
00:54:49,976 --> 00:54:52,946
it's a big number that we never talk about. Oh,

855
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:56,754
yeah, it's all there. I know

856
00:54:56,872 --> 00:54:59,778
all I have in here is the general fund, but of course, you're looking at

857
00:54:59,784 --> 00:55:02,806
the citywide expenditures. Okay. It's a big number,

858
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:06,486
right? The general fund is at least 60. And then when we

859
00:55:06,508 --> 00:55:10,550
go to slide 21, we talk about pension reform.

860
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:15,818
Well, my opinion a lot of that is working

861
00:55:15,904 --> 00:55:19,850
fantastic, especially rate of return because we always

862
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,626
guaranteed a rate of return. In the last couple of

863
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:27,466
years, a monkey could have received got you a high rate of

864
00:55:27,488 --> 00:55:30,174
return. Anyone could have done that.

865
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:33,918
In this fiscal year, I think it's going to be a negative rate of return.

866
00:55:34,004 --> 00:55:37,454
So the corridor is going to have to be looked at because that

867
00:55:37,492 --> 00:55:40,830
corridor is going to kick in, which is a softening,

868
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:43,700
a blending of a five year analysis. Correct.

869
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:47,666
So I think while your projections I disagree with

870
00:55:47,688 --> 00:55:51,346
two of your projections. Number one, sales tax revenue at zero.

871
00:55:51,528 --> 00:55:54,726
I went to the grocery store last night because I have family coming in this

872
00:55:54,748 --> 00:55:58,678
weekend, and I didn't buy any meat or any chicken or any pork or anything.

873
00:55:58,844 --> 00:56:02,434
I bought household items, toilet paper, things of that nature.

874
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:05,910
It was $462. And it's my wife and I,

875
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,130
so I don't go to the grocery store that often. But sales tax

876
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,362
are going to be a component of that. I think sales tax

877
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:16,054
revenue is going to continue as we've seen, continue to increase.

878
00:56:16,102 --> 00:56:19,470
And to classify it as zero, I think

879
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,830
isn't going to be accurate. The second part is,

880
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,526
I think, the liability on the pension side, while we've done a good job

881
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:30,618
of moving it from 8.2 to 1.5, I think we're

882
00:56:30,634 --> 00:56:33,426
going to have a little bit of a kick up because of guaranteed rate of

883
00:56:33,448 --> 00:56:36,846
the return, softening the market, the interest rates that we're

884
00:56:36,878 --> 00:56:41,880
seeing, et cetera. So my ultimate question is that

885
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:46,470
how do we looking at your slot of long term things to do?

886
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,130
It has a big category up there of the PFM

887
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:53,962
recommendations. So there's only

888
00:56:54,016 --> 00:56:57,194
one thing you can do, one thing only,

889
00:56:57,312 --> 00:57:01,622
and to move employees from defined contribution benefit

890
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:06,202
to defined contribution, that's it hard

891
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:10,426
thing to do. We made an obligation to our employees, dave Martin's

892
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:13,930
opinion, and we live up to that obligation. So if you started work yesterday,

893
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:17,710
you're going to receive a divine benefit plan. But somewhere down the road

894
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,186
you got to begin a defined contribution plan to get

895
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:24,834
rid of this $463,000,000 of

896
00:57:24,872 --> 00:57:28,610
growing liability that comes out of the general fund year in

897
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,694
and year out. Until you do that, we will

898
00:57:32,732 --> 00:57:35,714
never pass a structurally balanced budget.

899
00:57:35,842 --> 00:57:39,446
The mayor used the term yesterday. Well, it's pretty close to

900
00:57:39,468 --> 00:57:42,682
being structurally balanced, and it's a hard thing to do.

901
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:46,294
It's in government because of the defined benefit

902
00:57:46,342 --> 00:57:50,314
plan that we have. So unless you attack that and

903
00:57:50,352 --> 00:57:54,262
when I leave, I want to leave this financial position

904
00:57:54,336 --> 00:57:57,038
of the city better than I came in with.

905
00:57:57,124 --> 00:58:01,246
And I would invite a discussion on

906
00:58:01,268 --> 00:58:04,938
the movement of new employees, let's say January

907
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:08,510
1, 2023, for them to

908
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,622
move to a different benefit plan like we've done. I think in four different instances.

909
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:16,594
We have four different retirement plans. A fifth one out there has to be

910
00:58:16,632 --> 00:58:20,614
defined contribution, because if you don't do that,

911
00:58:20,652 --> 00:58:24,870
you will continue to build your liability year

912
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,120
after year after year, and you will never,

913
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:32,314
ever get out of it. Do you disagree or

914
00:58:32,352 --> 00:58:33,770
agree with those statements?

915
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,974
That is one of the way to reduce is, yes, defined contributions.

916
00:58:40,022 --> 00:58:43,386
But I know there's a lot of factors to

917
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:46,666
play in. And again, you are the decisions maker.

918
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:50,670
But yes, it's one of the way. Yeah, I mean,

919
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:54,254
it's a tough discussion to have because people say,

920
00:58:54,292 --> 00:58:57,902
well, pay is different. And I think we've done an okay job of

921
00:58:58,036 --> 00:59:02,514
pay. Okay job. That's my opinion. I looked at it as

922
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:06,862
it compares to corporate. We're losing a lot of good people to corporate.

923
00:59:06,926 --> 00:59:10,098
So we probably have to do something to the general

924
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:13,846
pay of employees. I know

925
00:59:13,868 --> 00:59:16,534
I haven't heard of the ding. I'm probably talking too long, but when I talk

926
00:59:16,572 --> 00:59:20,134
to young college graduates let me finish

927
00:59:20,172 --> 00:59:23,810
this. When I talk to young college graduates and ask them, when you

928
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:27,366
go to work, what are you looking for? They never once mentioned I'm

929
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:31,382
looking for in 40 years what my defined

930
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:35,038
contribution benefit plan is going to look like. They want pay,

931
00:59:35,124 --> 00:59:38,366
they want family time, which we help, which we did

932
00:59:38,388 --> 00:59:41,306
with the parental leave. They want vacation.

933
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:45,182
They want really cost of really

934
00:59:45,236 --> 00:59:48,738
ease of living and things that make their life, family life, balance a

935
00:59:48,744 --> 00:59:51,986
lot better. I'll come back to summarize that. I'll go

936
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:54,130
now to council Member Abby Cayman.

937
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:58,420
Thank you.

938
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,826
I'm going to divert away from this current topic,

939
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:08,130
but I did want to ask one thing. As we're mentioning

940
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,766
retirement, assisting those who may

941
01:00:11,788 --> 01:00:15,750
need assistance, things of that nature, how much are our seniors

942
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:19,990
and disabled homeowners getting with the proposed

943
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:23,580
increase in the homestead exemption or how much are they going to be saving?

944
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,946
So we run some calculations on that. Again, this is

945
01:00:27,968 --> 01:00:30,846
going to be a proposal that the mayor is going to bring forward separately to

946
01:00:30,868 --> 01:00:34,286
the council to increase the senior and

947
01:00:34,308 --> 01:00:38,018
disabled tax exemptions from 160,000 to 260,000.

948
01:00:38,184 --> 01:00:42,286
So we look at an average homes

949
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:45,794
of 300,000, for example. When we look at that.

950
01:00:45,832 --> 01:00:50,046
Now, keep in mind, there is also a standard homestead

951
01:00:50,078 --> 01:00:54,146
exemption, which is 20% of the values, right? So when you look at the average

952
01:00:54,178 --> 01:00:57,574
home of 300,000, you're looking at about saving.

953
01:00:57,692 --> 01:01:01,522
This is approximate about $440 per

954
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:05,546
annual, about $440 that

955
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:06,540
they can save.

956
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,540
And again, this is based on our current tax rate.

957
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:14,860
Thank you. Thank you.

958
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:19,370
Council member. Leticia plumber.

959
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,870
Council Member Sally Alcorn.

960
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,534
Thank you. And just to piggyback a little bit on the mayor protem, I do

961
01:01:29,572 --> 01:01:32,686
appreciate and we had a discussion in one of the budget meetings about your bringing

962
01:01:32,718 --> 01:01:35,570
forth some recommendations. Short term and long term,

963
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:39,894
they're pretty broad, and we're going to have to be more specific

964
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:41,000
about them.

965
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:47,398
We're a people business. And I think we have made some strides in health benefits.

966
01:01:47,484 --> 01:01:50,710
Even the $75 surcharge for spouses,

967
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:54,680
that made an impact. People left and went to

968
01:01:56,830 --> 01:02:00,362
a spouse, went to their own insurance. I think that made it being a people

969
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:04,202
business. You can't get at the structural imbalances without things like

970
01:02:04,256 --> 01:02:07,722
pension and health benefits and things and things, salaries that

971
01:02:07,776 --> 01:02:11,274
impact people. So they are tough discussions, Mayor Protem,

972
01:02:11,322 --> 01:02:14,126
but you're right on the money. I mean, those are the kinds of things that

973
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:16,960
will bring us into structural balance. One point,

974
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,926
and I forgot to mention council member David Robinson, council Member

975
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:24,526
Carolyn Evans Chabaz and Council Member Robert

976
01:02:24,558 --> 01:02:28,180
Gallegos has joined us a long time ago.

977
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,906
Got you twice, so you deserve to be gotten twice.

978
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:35,330
So there are no other comments

979
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:37,560
or questions from council members.

980
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,630
You just popped in. Tiffany d thomas.

981
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:47,290
Sorry, quick question. This is for Mr. Will. Can you go back and clarify

982
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,860
the transition for the It? You talked about

983
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:55,286
a process, phase two, and then the system implementation.

984
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:58,480
Can you give the timeline for that? Again, I didn't catch that.

985
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:03,246
Let me go back. So the process is what

986
01:03:03,268 --> 01:03:06,606
we're working on now. So what I'm waiting for

987
01:03:06,628 --> 01:03:10,270
is to map out how long is it going to take to change the process,

988
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,538
and then I can find out how long it's going to take for us to

989
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:17,122
get a system in place. So I don't know the timeline exactly for the system,

990
01:03:17,176 --> 01:03:20,840
but I will know probably by next month or so. Yes, sir.

991
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:28,322
Is that it, TIFF?

992
01:03:28,386 --> 01:03:31,974
Yes, thank you. So my last

993
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:35,782
comments, I think it's something we need to study. Is it something

994
01:03:35,836 --> 01:03:39,114
we need to implement on a certain time frame? That's for

995
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:42,506
council to decide and to debate. But I think it's something that we really need

996
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:46,054
to look at. And can you do a hodgepodge of different plans?

997
01:03:46,102 --> 01:03:49,386
What are the options that are available to reduce the long term liability?

998
01:03:49,498 --> 01:03:52,954
Because we have balanced this budget by a number of measures.

999
01:03:53,002 --> 01:03:57,006
Thank God for ARPA funds, previous land sales, and divestitures of

1000
01:03:57,028 --> 01:04:00,518
property. That's how we've always balanced the budget

1001
01:04:00,554 --> 01:04:03,614
to a certain degree. So one of the things that the mayor

1002
01:04:03,662 --> 01:04:06,702
said yesterday in his press conference, which is totally accurate,

1003
01:04:06,846 --> 01:04:10,066
when the credit agencies look at us, moody's, Standard and

1004
01:04:10,088 --> 01:04:13,106
Poors, Fitch, even Dun and Brad Street,

1005
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:17,142
they look at the viability, long term viability of the city,

1006
01:04:17,276 --> 01:04:20,914
and they say, well, as he said yesterday, you're restricted

1007
01:04:20,962 --> 01:04:24,694
by three things. Revenue cap. Well, that's not going away unless

1008
01:04:24,742 --> 01:04:28,714
the state changes pension reform, moving from

1009
01:04:28,752 --> 01:04:32,886
8.2 billion of liability to 1.5 billion

1010
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:37,066
a plus. Excellent idea. Excellent concept.

1011
01:04:37,098 --> 01:04:40,186
That works. OPEB liability,

1012
01:04:40,298 --> 01:04:44,238
OPEB trust fund or creation? As Council Member Alcorn mentioned,

1013
01:04:44,324 --> 01:04:47,810
we've done a few things on the health benefit side for retirees

1014
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,266
to make that more fiscally prudent for the

1015
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:54,594
city. The next iteration of that is how do you

1016
01:04:54,632 --> 01:04:58,674
handle the lingering defined benefit payment

1017
01:04:58,872 --> 01:05:02,594
that some folks are retiring in their drawn

1018
01:05:02,642 --> 01:05:06,598
retirement pay in their we've done a really good job

1019
01:05:06,684 --> 01:05:10,566
of looking at drop and doing something with that. But I

1020
01:05:10,588 --> 01:05:14,586
would recommend that this body study that and

1021
01:05:14,608 --> 01:05:18,794
really look hard at maybe coming up with some type of

1022
01:05:18,992 --> 01:05:23,098
a plan not for existing employees, but for employees that

1023
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:26,314
aren't in this building today. Because I believe when you

1024
01:05:26,352 --> 01:05:29,374
make a commitment to employees, you live up to it.

1025
01:05:29,572 --> 01:05:32,510
And if you have that on the paper today,

1026
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:36,702
you should be responsible for that till the day that that person leaves and

1027
01:05:36,756 --> 01:05:40,514
retires and does other things. But I still am convinced that the long

1028
01:05:40,552 --> 01:05:45,310
term fiscally prudent thing, according to our consultants

1029
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:49,880
that we engaged a couple of years ago, was looking at that. We do have

1030
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:53,890
five public speakers for the five year forecast.

1031
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:57,970
We'll start off with Ms. Sarah Blanding.

1032
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:02,154
Saba blanding star six

1033
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:05,082
to unmute Ms. Blanding. Welcome again.

1034
01:06:05,136 --> 01:06:09,020
You're an active participator in these. Thank you.

1035
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,660
Saba Blanding. Star six to unmute. Mute.

1036
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,284
And if not, we will come back to you. We can

1037
01:06:25,322 --> 01:06:27,430
see you, but we can't hear you. Star six,

1038
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,650
we have you now.

1039
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,820
Star six again,

1040
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:51,926
speak. I'm unmuted. Can you hear me

1041
01:06:51,948 --> 01:06:55,010
okay? Yes. Okay. Wonderful.

1042
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:59,066
Apologies for that delay. I had a few questions for you all.

1043
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:03,286
The first is what is the impact of the various collective

1044
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:06,554
bargaining agreements on this forecast? I'd love

1045
01:07:06,592 --> 01:07:10,470
to hear you all discuss if you have some time today and kind

1046
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,274
of along with that, what information do you have about the potential financial

1047
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:18,718
impact of pay parity for firefighters if that ends up having to

1048
01:07:18,724 --> 01:07:21,886
be implemented? I noticed there was a 6% increase

1049
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:25,426
for firefighters, but I wasn't 100% sure

1050
01:07:25,528 --> 01:07:27,330
how that would impact the budget.

1051
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:33,246
And yeah, I guess I'll throw in one

1052
01:07:33,288 --> 01:07:36,120
more question if I have time.

1053
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:41,046
Many council members in the mayor have mentioned increasing the size of

1054
01:07:41,068 --> 01:07:44,610
HPD is a priority. There's five additional cadet classes

1055
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:48,006
that are proposed. What are the long term budget

1056
01:07:48,038 --> 01:07:51,494
implications of increasing the classified headcount for HPD,

1057
01:07:51,622 --> 01:07:54,874
especially considering the passage of House

1058
01:07:54,912 --> 01:07:58,298
Bill 1900 last summer? So I'll leave the

1059
01:07:58,304 --> 01:08:01,694
rest of my time to hear back from you all.

1060
01:08:01,892 --> 01:08:04,910
Appreciate it. Write those down.

1061
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,366
First question was collective bargaining process. I got the first. How was it working?

1062
01:08:08,468 --> 01:08:12,350
So, on slide 18, we do show the employee compensation

1063
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:16,210
impact in the budget, which is about 44.6 million,

1064
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,822
and that includes all three employee

1065
01:08:19,886 --> 01:08:23,454
groups. But it also factors in attrition and things like that.

1066
01:08:23,512 --> 01:08:26,742
So it's about 44.6

1067
01:08:26,796 --> 01:08:29,986
million in this budget. But that is for Aldo.

1068
01:08:30,018 --> 01:08:32,630
That's municipal policing fires.

1069
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:37,098
So if you ask for a 6% fire

1070
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:41,018
specific, I don't have it on the slides, but I

1071
01:08:41,024 --> 01:08:44,218
can get back to you on that and we will post

1072
01:08:44,304 --> 01:08:47,100
all the answers to SharePoint. Correct,

1073
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:48,460
correct.

1074
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:54,730
Posting the SharePoint. The other question was police

1075
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:57,886
cadets related to budget? If I read

1076
01:08:57,908 --> 01:09:01,774
the numbers right, I. Think the number of FTEs, the headcount in

1077
01:09:01,812 --> 01:09:05,682
Houston Police Department decreased from by

1078
01:09:05,816 --> 01:09:09,922
4% last year. Fiscal year 22

1079
01:09:09,976 --> 01:09:13,654
includes six cadet classes, and then in this fiscal year,

1080
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:18,098
it includes five cadet classes. Overall number of police department

1081
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:21,906
employees decreased by 4% last fiscal

1082
01:09:21,938 --> 01:09:25,030
year to this fiscal year, according to your projection.

1083
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:29,686
Go ahead. I was going to say just retirement on our question,

1084
01:09:29,868 --> 01:09:33,618
it's not five additional classes, it's five if

1085
01:09:33,644 --> 01:09:36,698
six was in the base. So we actually reduced to five.

1086
01:09:36,784 --> 01:09:40,246
So it's not a growth in classes.

1087
01:09:40,358 --> 01:09:43,694
So in terms of the budget for that cost, it actually was

1088
01:09:43,732 --> 01:09:47,182
a little lower for the cadet classes. For police going into 23.

1089
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:51,322
They're not additional. And according to Chief Finner,

1090
01:09:51,386 --> 01:09:55,038
it was five classes at like 55 cadets.

1091
01:09:55,134 --> 01:09:58,530
It's going to be five classes at 70 plus

1092
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,922
cadets. So we'll have what's, equivalent to a

1093
01:10:01,976 --> 01:10:04,680
six class built into the five class process?

1094
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:07,682
Correct. Okay, next speaker,

1095
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:10,950
Mr. Jason Oliver.

1096
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:13,240
Star six, please.

1097
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:21,146
Good afternoon, everyone. So I

1098
01:10:21,168 --> 01:10:25,398
want to follow up because I heard Saba ask about the impact of pay parity

1099
01:10:25,494 --> 01:10:29,402
and what might be the potential impact of that, not the specific raise,

1100
01:10:29,466 --> 01:10:33,118
the six six six that was implemented. So I

1101
01:10:33,124 --> 01:10:34,480
want to follow up on that.

1102
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,920
Do you all have that information?

1103
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:44,914
Go ahead. I was going to say, so that would have to be a new

1104
01:10:44,952 --> 01:10:46,820
analysis. When we looked way back,

1105
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:51,186
2018 or 19, we were looking at the pay

1106
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:54,326
parity analysis. So much has changed since then.

1107
01:10:54,428 --> 01:10:57,958
So, no, we don't have that number right now.

1108
01:10:58,044 --> 01:11:01,874
Yeah. This budget presentation is purely focused

1109
01:11:01,922 --> 01:11:06,078
on what is in the fiscal year 23 operating budget.

1110
01:11:06,274 --> 01:11:09,770
In this fiscal year 23 budget, we include a 6%

1111
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,930
pay raises for the firefighters.

1112
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:18,686
That would significantly, probably change and increase our

1113
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:21,934
liabilities, though, right? We get much

1114
01:11:21,972 --> 01:11:25,680
closer and probably move beyond the pessimistic. Is that the case?

1115
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:32,026
I'm sorry, say that again. We'd probably end up moving

1116
01:11:32,148 --> 01:11:35,762
much closer to or perhaps beyond the pessimistic if the

1117
01:11:35,896 --> 01:11:39,154
decision ends up going toward the firefighters. Is that the case?

1118
01:11:39,272 --> 01:11:43,098
So if there is any cases and increased

1119
01:11:43,214 --> 01:11:46,118
expenses that happen during the fiscal year,

1120
01:11:46,284 --> 01:11:50,040
then yes, it will be something that we will have to address at that point.

1121
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:55,846
Okay. And the personnel challenges that

1122
01:11:55,868 --> 01:11:59,514
you all mentioned for finance, right. Like you talked about a high number

1123
01:11:59,552 --> 01:12:03,638
of Vacancies. That seems to be an issue across the city's departments.

1124
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:07,306
Do you see a need for more competitive pay in the city? And if

1125
01:12:07,328 --> 01:12:10,090
so, is that factored into your projections?

1126
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:15,786
Competitive pay? Yeah. No, I mean, I think it's a combination of

1127
01:12:15,808 --> 01:12:19,546
things that you're seeing across this in the city is what we're seeing throughout

1128
01:12:19,578 --> 01:12:22,938
the United States with the great resignation. So it's

1129
01:12:22,954 --> 01:12:26,066
a combination of things. And I do believe the

1130
01:12:26,088 --> 01:12:29,842
city is starting to move in the right direction with the parental leave to

1131
01:12:29,896 --> 01:12:32,754
be able to retain employees. Of course,

1132
01:12:32,792 --> 01:12:36,406
pay. We're always looking at studying certain positions to see

1133
01:12:36,428 --> 01:12:40,306
if we're paying appropriately. Like I know we put a lot of attention in legal

1134
01:12:40,498 --> 01:12:44,790
for the attorneys because that's where we're losing a lot of attorneys

1135
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:49,026
because of pay. So we are doing those things. So I'm hoping

1136
01:12:49,138 --> 01:12:52,726
that with these things we're doing we'll start to be able to retain

1137
01:12:52,758 --> 01:12:56,406
more employees. But it's across the nation, not just the city, that's facing

1138
01:12:56,438 --> 01:13:00,426
this problem. And if I could add, keep in mind as well human resource departments

1139
01:13:00,538 --> 01:13:04,126
also conducted those market studies right. Which is based

1140
01:13:04,148 --> 01:13:06,640
on the financial policies every three years.

1141
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:11,214
Thank you. Okay. And my last question to increase

1142
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:14,990
the fund balance is a reduction in spending on classified

1143
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:19,314
officers a viable strategy to ensure fiscal sustainability since

1144
01:13:19,352 --> 01:13:22,130
they're one of our largest general fund liabilities.

1145
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:26,694
In theory, the fund balance will be increased either from the increased revenues or

1146
01:13:26,732 --> 01:13:30,418
reduction in expenditures. It's just based on what we dealt

1147
01:13:30,434 --> 01:13:33,846
with, revenues and expenditures. Any increase in the fund balance, it's just

1148
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,240
a combination of both.

1149
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:41,434
Okay, thank you. Thank you. And I made a mistake. SharePoint is only

1150
01:13:41,472 --> 01:13:45,146
available to council members and staff, but if you have questions and

1151
01:13:45,168 --> 01:13:49,230
you'd like us to answer them, email us at District E at houst

1152
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:53,434
gov and we will work you to get the questions answered.

1153
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:57,630
Once again. District e at Houst gov.

1154
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,950
Mr. Arisbrown.

1155
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:05,220
Star six, please.

1156
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:12,740
Hi, this is Aris Brown. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1157
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:16,914
No worries. Hi, I have a couple of questions.

1158
01:14:17,032 --> 01:14:21,238
One of the questions I was thinking about one

1159
01:14:21,244 --> 01:14:25,174
of the sections within the general fund revenue section it was

1160
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:28,674
focused on increasing the budget by funds from Park

1161
01:14:28,722 --> 01:14:32,422
Houston and that I believe relies on cars and parking

1162
01:14:32,486 --> 01:14:35,958
costs even though Houston has been slowly but surely implementing

1163
01:14:35,974 --> 01:14:39,126
more bike routes and hopefully more reliable public transit.

1164
01:14:39,238 --> 01:14:43,258
So one of my questions was about the priorities of the city in

1165
01:14:43,264 --> 01:14:47,482
the coming years. Is there still going to be a reliance upon a car centric

1166
01:14:47,546 --> 01:14:50,490
city and relying upon the revenues that come from cars?

1167
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:54,080
And I'm curious about how that aligns with the goals to be

1168
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,906
bike routes and walkability and

1169
01:15:00,088 --> 01:15:03,726
that sort of progressive idea, especially as we see uncertainty

1170
01:15:03,758 --> 01:15:07,526
in the oil industry. So that was one of my questions. Another one

1171
01:15:07,548 --> 01:15:10,550
of my questions was about the outcome based budget.

1172
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:15,750
We've had conversations about this with past budget

1173
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:20,234
conversations, workshops, et cetera, in which community members have

1174
01:15:20,272 --> 01:15:24,266
expressed their concerns and wanted to offer ideas about how

1175
01:15:24,288 --> 01:15:27,690
to implement the needs of their community.

1176
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,994
So I'm curious about they're in the basis of implementing outcome

1177
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:35,646
based budget, factor in community engagement and an analysis of

1178
01:15:35,668 --> 01:15:37,390
ethics and community ethics.

1179
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:44,514
I did not get the first one but I think I

1180
01:15:44,552 --> 01:15:47,682
follow your second questions on the outcome based

1181
01:15:47,736 --> 01:15:50,260
budgeting to engage the public.

1182
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:54,954
Right now, the outcome based budgeting is an internal

1183
01:15:55,022 --> 01:15:59,990
process so that we can provide the information relevant

1184
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:04,306
to the Council for decisions

1185
01:16:04,498 --> 01:16:07,846
which is based on the current programs that

1186
01:16:07,868 --> 01:16:10,460
is in the departments at this point.

1187
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:15,546
I think that's all I can add. Yeah, I would just add that the

1188
01:16:15,568 --> 01:16:19,174
Plan Houston really is kind of driving from the community engagement.

1189
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:22,894
So if planning does another update to the Plan

1190
01:16:22,932 --> 01:16:26,078
Houston or all of that will drive some of

1191
01:16:26,084 --> 01:16:28,190
the community involvement.

1192
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,474
Yeah, no, thank you to rephrase. I guess

1193
01:16:33,512 --> 01:16:38,238
my first question, I'm looking at the funding.

1194
01:16:38,414 --> 01:16:42,290
I think there's a little

1195
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,040
footnote that says that the

1196
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:49,986
increase primarily in transfer from Park Houston

1197
01:16:50,018 --> 01:16:54,134
Fund on page ten, on page

1198
01:16:54,172 --> 01:16:57,486
ten of the fiscal year 2023 general fund revenue,

1199
01:16:57,538 --> 01:17:00,890
including other resources, there's the sub note seven

1200
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,746
that says that there's an increase primarily in transfer from Park East and

1201
01:17:04,768 --> 01:17:08,602
Fund, which means parking. I'm curious about how that

1202
01:17:08,656 --> 01:17:12,686
aligns with being a less car centric city and having more

1203
01:17:12,868 --> 01:17:16,894
people driving, having people more like biking and walking and

1204
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:20,686
public transport, transit. I'm curious about how those two align and

1205
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:23,742
whether or not they do align. Is there still a goal to be a less

1206
01:17:23,796 --> 01:17:27,634
car centric city or are we still going to rely for the next couple

1207
01:17:27,672 --> 01:17:31,250
of years on parking costs and those sorts of things,

1208
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,754
even with the uncertainty in the oil industry? I think I

1209
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:38,354
follow I know it's a little bit mumbling, but I think I follow the jess

1210
01:17:38,402 --> 01:17:42,374
of your question. So you're going back to slide ten where

1211
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:45,746
we have an increased revenues transfer from the Park

1212
01:17:45,778 --> 01:17:49,722
Houston Fund. Correct. So based

1213
01:17:49,776 --> 01:17:53,180
on the ordinance created for the Park Houston Fund,

1214
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:57,094
and that is a special fund, so essentially

1215
01:17:57,222 --> 01:18:01,146
any excess fund over, I believe it's 2 million is

1216
01:18:01,168 --> 01:18:04,862
to be transferred to the general fund. So in the last

1217
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:08,462
year, the last two years, of course with the stay at home and the

1218
01:18:08,516 --> 01:18:11,726
pandemic, there is no such revenues generated in

1219
01:18:11,748 --> 01:18:14,894
that special fund. So now that it start picking up,

1220
01:18:14,932 --> 01:18:18,754
then that fund has been generating revenues. In that sense, the ordinance can

1221
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:21,986
be picking up back again where any excess of a 2

1222
01:18:22,008 --> 01:18:26,138
million will be transferred to the general fund. So this is not impacting

1223
01:18:26,254 --> 01:18:29,078
the current operations of the special fund itself.

1224
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:32,674
This is just a financial that is aligned to the ordinance

1225
01:18:32,722 --> 01:18:34,200
created for that fund.

1226
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:39,670
Thank you, Ms. Brown. Next speaker is Mr. Christopher Rivera.

1227
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:42,220
Christopher Rivera, star six.

1228
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:48,860
Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Go ahead.

1229
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:53,034
Great. Thank you everyone. I'm just going to give a little context

1230
01:18:53,082 --> 01:18:54,000
for my question.

1231
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:59,594
This fiscal year, the Housing and Community Department will only receive

1232
01:18:59,642 --> 01:19:03,258
0.1% of what the Houston Police Department is expected to receive

1233
01:19:03,274 --> 01:19:06,626
in funding. Examining the overall budget, the housing department will

1234
01:19:06,648 --> 01:19:10,766
only receive 0.1% from the $2.74 billion

1235
01:19:10,798 --> 01:19:13,662
general budget. As the city cuts funding for housing,

1236
01:19:13,726 --> 01:19:17,038
rent is continuously increasing. Local reports say rent

1237
01:19:17,054 --> 01:19:20,166
has gone up 23% in Houston, but experts say they will not

1238
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:23,666
come down. The rent increase is only making it harder for Houstonians

1239
01:19:23,698 --> 01:19:27,846
to stay safe and sheltered. Just last week, there was 783

1240
01:19:27,868 --> 01:19:31,386
Evictions filed in Houston, and since March 2020, there has

1241
01:19:31,408 --> 01:19:33,610
been over 85 Evictions filed.

1242
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:37,626
Houstonians are struggling to keep themselves safe because they are losing the ability to

1243
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:40,886
pay their homes or apartments. The city needs to reimagine

1244
01:19:40,918 --> 01:19:44,894
public safety and consider housing programs as a solution to public safety issues.

1245
01:19:45,012 --> 01:19:48,926
Now, my question is, in the next five years, how will the city of

1246
01:19:48,948 --> 01:19:52,406
Houston address our growing public safety need for affordable permanent

1247
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:56,162
housing programs when it continues to deplete public safety services

1248
01:19:56,296 --> 01:20:00,526
like housing only into increased services that criminalize

1249
01:20:00,558 --> 01:20:02,610
communities like the police budget.

1250
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:09,366
So I know on housing departments, the large

1251
01:20:09,548 --> 01:20:12,866
revenue source they have is through the grants.

1252
01:20:12,978 --> 01:20:16,966
A large of their operations is grant funded. I think

1253
01:20:16,988 --> 01:20:20,330
you mentioned about public safety in that area.

1254
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,754
I understand that police departments do work hand in hand with

1255
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:27,082
housing departments and any other departments when it comes to public

1256
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,954
safety to support those operations as well. You probably

1257
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:34,906
will get more details from housing departments when we do have those specific budget

1258
01:20:34,938 --> 01:20:39,022
workshop. But again, this is a general fund and they do have

1259
01:20:39,076 --> 01:20:42,586
a small portions in the general fund because they are largely funded out of

1260
01:20:42,628 --> 01:20:46,260
grants. So here's my follow up. How will we

1261
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:50,222
become self sustainable? And just in case we lose

1262
01:20:50,286 --> 01:20:51,890
those federal grants,

1263
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:57,158
it will be something that we have to adjust. And I think that's, like I

1264
01:20:57,164 --> 01:21:00,706
said, it's one of those importance to preserve

1265
01:21:00,738 --> 01:21:03,814
fund balance because those needs will arise. And I think that's why

1266
01:21:03,932 --> 01:21:07,270
we have those set aside,

1267
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:11,180
fund balance to prepare us going forward.

1268
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:16,534
Thank you. Mr. Rivera, I think that's an outstanding

1269
01:21:16,582 --> 01:21:20,410
question. We talked about that at council this morning. Affordable housing.

1270
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:24,174
I'm not sure if there is such a thing as affordable housing. What I'm seeing

1271
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,566
in the marketplace, every time you turn around, interest rates are going up

1272
01:21:27,588 --> 01:21:31,214
and affordable housing costs are going through the roof with

1273
01:21:31,252 --> 01:21:34,878
the cost of material. So you're exactly right. That is going to be

1274
01:21:34,884 --> 01:21:38,034
a challenge for us in this world that we live in, is how we

1275
01:21:38,072 --> 01:21:41,874
define affordable housing, how do we deal with it? And I know that the

1276
01:21:41,912 --> 01:21:45,186
Housing Committee, in the hands of Tiffany Thomas, is doing a great job with

1277
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:49,046
that and will continue to do a great job with that. But that is a

1278
01:21:49,068 --> 01:21:52,200
tough question to answer for all of us. I know it is for me.

1279
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:57,474
Thank you. Last but not least, mr. Doug Smith.

1280
01:21:57,522 --> 01:21:59,500
Doug, I hope you're feeling better.

1281
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:04,870
I felt better for days, but I'm still testing negative,

1282
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:08,106
positive, so that's why I'm not there today. But thank

1283
01:22:08,128 --> 01:22:11,674
you for asking. Stay away. Yeah, I will.

1284
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:15,294
That's what Jessica said too. And then I intend to hopefully by next

1285
01:22:15,332 --> 01:22:18,894
Monday I'll be testing negative. But in any

1286
01:22:18,932 --> 01:22:22,522
case, a couple of questions. First of all, do I understand correctly

1287
01:22:22,586 --> 01:22:25,902
that the first tranche of the ARPA funds

1288
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:29,154
around $300 million, about half was used

1289
01:22:29,192 --> 01:22:32,802
last year and half was used this year. And you have not taken

1290
01:22:32,856 --> 01:22:36,566
the other 300 million into consideration. When you

1291
01:22:36,588 --> 01:22:40,278
did your proposed what was the proposed budget gap? I think I understood you

1292
01:22:40,284 --> 01:22:43,862
to say that. And then I wanted to address you

1293
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:47,558
talked about how we continue

1294
01:22:47,644 --> 01:22:51,002
to address the gap and you say

1295
01:22:51,056 --> 01:22:55,210
continue hiring control. And yet when I look at the General Fund budget,

1296
01:22:55,790 --> 01:23:00,010
between 2021 and the projected 2023,

1297
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:03,422
there's an addition of 766, full time

1298
01:23:03,476 --> 01:23:06,894
equivalents. And in addition to that,

1299
01:23:07,092 --> 01:23:10,362
obviously there's the huge one, huge large increases

1300
01:23:10,426 --> 01:23:13,730
in pay that you're going to have to deal with over the next three years

1301
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,502
as the previous ones, the agreements

1302
01:23:17,566 --> 01:23:21,700
come in. And finally, I think let me check,

1303
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:26,310
I think that's it on page 76,

1304
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,310
26 of your presentation,

1305
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:32,374
under your projections for the police and the

1306
01:23:32,492 --> 01:23:35,906
firefighters, you have a low for the police

1307
01:23:35,938 --> 01:23:38,938
of 27, three to 30, 212,

1308
01:23:39,104 --> 01:23:42,954
and you project them at nearly the full high amount.

1309
01:23:43,152 --> 01:23:46,714
And for the fire department, you project them

1310
01:23:46,752 --> 01:23:50,434
at the very lowest amount. And I'm curious how you decided

1311
01:23:50,502 --> 01:23:53,790
to differentiate that. And then finally,

1312
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:57,390
on the outcome based budget, on page

1313
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:01,114
33, you have different categories

1314
01:24:01,162 --> 01:24:04,866
that need to be met. Do you have timelines for when you expect to

1315
01:24:04,888 --> 01:24:07,860
have those categories done?

1316
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:10,020
And that's it.

1317
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:19,670
I think the first question was related to FTEs. He said

1318
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:23,014
there's an increase of FTEs of I think it was 700

1319
01:24:23,052 --> 01:24:25,654
and some odd. Yes,

1320
01:24:25,692 --> 01:24:26,920
766.

1321
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:34,598
2nd question was a counterpart

1322
01:24:34,614 --> 01:24:38,266
of that with pay, increase in pay, 6% for fire,

1323
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:40,380
4% for police. Yes,

1324
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:44,762
municipal. So how do you afford increasing

1325
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:48,474
FTEs and increasing pay within the confines of the general budget?

1326
01:24:48,522 --> 01:24:51,342
I think that was his question. Yeah,

1327
01:24:51,396 --> 01:24:54,738
exactly. And as it relates to your goal to

1328
01:24:54,824 --> 01:24:59,010
address the gap, to continue hiring control, it makes it very difficult

1329
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,926
to do that with those figures I'm

1330
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:06,946
trying to follow. When you say increase in FTEs, are you

1331
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:10,920
looking at the citywide FTEs from a specific fiscal year?

1332
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:17,254
No, just the general fund. On the General Fund FTEs on

1333
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:20,220
page twelve. Page twelve,

1334
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:27,754
slide twelve. I'm looking at

1335
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:32,794
page twelve. Hang on table

1336
01:25:32,842 --> 01:25:36,558
five at the very bottom, because if I'm looking at page

1337
01:25:36,644 --> 01:25:38,880
seven, which is General Fund specific,

1338
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:44,980
I'm showing a reduction from fiscal year 22 to 23,

1339
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:48,660
from 13 seven to 13 five.

1340
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:52,020
I just want to make sure we are on the same page.

1341
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:58,678
Excuse me. It was 2021, was the base year

1342
01:25:58,764 --> 01:26:02,742
between 2021 and projected 2023,

1343
01:26:02,876 --> 01:26:06,086
there's an increase of 766 when

1344
01:26:06,108 --> 01:26:09,954
you add both the regular plus the overtime

1345
01:26:10,002 --> 01:26:13,498
FTEs. Okay, keep in mind in fiscal year, and I think we have that in

1346
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:16,730
the footnote, fiscal year 20 and fiscal year 21,

1347
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,682
it shows a lower FTEs because of the redeployment that are

1348
01:26:20,736 --> 01:26:24,302
funded out of CRF. So that

1349
01:26:24,356 --> 01:26:27,710
FTEs in 21 and 20 and 2020

1350
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:31,246
were kind of skewed because of some of those are funded out

1351
01:26:31,268 --> 01:26:33,620
of CRF. And not out of the general fund.

1352
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:40,766
What is CRF again? Okay, and I

1353
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:44,574
think you also asked about the assumptions on the fire pension back

1354
01:26:44,612 --> 01:26:46,640
in page 26, correct?

1355
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:51,410
Yes. Okay, so the reason why on fire

1356
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:55,234
pension and police pension, we have the low and the

1357
01:26:55,272 --> 01:26:59,226
high. Again, this is on the pension city contributions,

1358
01:26:59,358 --> 01:27:03,350
which is again governed by the pension reform.

1359
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:07,574
Right now, for the fire pensions, they are below the

1360
01:27:07,612 --> 01:27:11,186
minimum corridor. So when you fall below the minimum

1361
01:27:11,218 --> 01:27:14,602
corridor, the city contributions will be based on the minimum point,

1362
01:27:14,656 --> 01:27:15,930
not the midpoint.

1363
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:21,274
Okay. And that's why we put a range, because that can change

1364
01:27:21,312 --> 01:27:22,700
in the next five years.

1365
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:30,046
Okay. Question. What is CRF? You referred to CRF. What is

1366
01:27:30,068 --> 01:27:33,082
that? CRF. CRF.

1367
01:27:33,146 --> 01:27:36,286
That is the Coronavirus Relief Fund. That is based on the

1368
01:27:36,308 --> 01:27:39,842
Care. Okay. That's the cares act. Okay,

1369
01:27:39,896 --> 01:27:42,260
fine. Correct. And I guess finally,

1370
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:46,194
do you have time limits or can you assign timelines to

1371
01:27:46,232 --> 01:27:50,406
your outcome based budget? Page 33 of

1372
01:27:50,428 --> 01:27:53,880
the various steps that have to take place before this happens.

1373
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:58,598
So, first step will be the process.

1374
01:27:58,764 --> 01:28:02,806
So I do anticipate by December of

1375
01:28:02,828 --> 01:28:06,346
next year we will have the process in place. What I

1376
01:28:06,368 --> 01:28:09,686
don't know is that the system will be ready by then, but the goal

1377
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:13,546
is for FY 24 budget, hopefully by December, at least we have

1378
01:28:13,648 --> 01:28:17,280
the outcome based budgeting process in place so that we can follow the process.

1379
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:20,110
Thanks, Mr. Smith.

1380
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:25,182
Okay, thank you. Before we move on to Houston Fire

1381
01:28:25,236 --> 01:28:28,720
Department, are there any other questions or comments from council members?

1382
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:32,880
We have no other public speakers that have signed up to speak in person,

1383
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:37,310
so I will ask again, is there any comments or questions

1384
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:41,960
from council members before we dismiss the great city of Houston finance team?

1385
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:45,206
Okay,
