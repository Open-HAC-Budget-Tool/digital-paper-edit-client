WEBVTT

00:04.550 --> 00:05.100
It.

00:08.830 --> 00:12.300
Welcome, Director. And the floor is yours. Thank you.

00:14.990 --> 00:18.300
I feel really short. Okay.

00:20.430 --> 00:23.914
I know. Good afternoon. I'm here to present the FY 23

00:23.952 --> 00:27.526
budget proposal for the Administration and Regulatory Affairs

00:27.558 --> 00:30.946
Department. With me is Val Barry, the CFO for our

00:30.968 --> 00:34.180
department. Next slide, please.

00:35.910 --> 00:39.022
Ara has 18 separate business units.

00:39.166 --> 00:42.494
We're a composite of multiple functional areas

00:42.542 --> 00:46.162
across the city that didn't fit into a single type of department.

00:46.306 --> 00:49.990
And so we have this spread across ten divisions spread across

00:50.060 --> 00:53.286
four different funds. And so we're here to talk about that today.

00:53.388 --> 00:56.086
This slide shows our general fund division.

00:56.278 --> 00:59.846
We have several of our ads and our deputy director

00:59.878 --> 01:04.298
here. The divisions are listed on this slide. The Director's office.

01:04.384 --> 01:08.202
Obviously. Sustainability and Resilience, which is Deputy Director

01:08.266 --> 01:11.674
Priya Zechariah, who is here? Franchise administration.

01:11.802 --> 01:15.786
Valerie Barry, regulatory permitting. Catherine Bruning.

01:15.898 --> 01:19.498
Payroll Services is Karen Davidson, who could not be here today because her husband's

01:19.514 --> 01:22.994
in the hospital. Operations in three one one, which is

01:23.032 --> 01:26.558
Charles Jackson, and Financial Services, which is also Valerie

01:26.574 --> 01:30.546
Berry. One of the things that I want to note before we

01:30.568 --> 01:34.526
leave this slide is I'd like you to draw your attention to the number

01:34.568 --> 01:38.354
that you see before you as our proposed FY 23 budget

01:38.402 --> 01:42.870
of 32.174 million, we round that to 32.2.

01:43.020 --> 01:47.046
However, 10.8 million of that amount is the transfer to the Bark

01:47.078 --> 01:51.254
Special Fund from the general fund. So our actual budget

01:51.302 --> 01:54.854
for the general fund is $21.4 million. Next slide,

01:54.902 --> 01:58.534
please. So the previous slide showed

01:58.582 --> 02:02.366
you our general fund operations. This slide, as well as the next three will

02:02.388 --> 02:05.998
represent the organization charts for the special funds and the Central Services

02:06.084 --> 02:09.398
Revolving Fund that we manage. On this slide, we show the budget

02:09.434 --> 02:12.338
and division breakout for the Park Houston Special Fund.

02:12.504 --> 02:15.694
Park Houston is led by Maria Urshad

02:15.822 --> 02:19.086
and they manage all of the city's on street parking inventory.

02:19.198 --> 02:20.420
Next slide, please.

02:22.630 --> 02:25.906
Bark is the city's animal shelter. It is funded through the Bark

02:25.938 --> 02:28.946
Special Revenue Fund. And it's led by Greg Damienoff,

02:28.978 --> 02:32.690
assistant director, who is also here. The Bark Operational Division

02:32.770 --> 02:36.346
includes six sections that administer all of the programs and services that

02:36.368 --> 02:40.060
we provide for Houston's pets and pet owners. Next slide, please.

02:41.630 --> 02:45.558
The property and casualty fund is a revolving fund where Ara's

02:45.574 --> 02:49.594
risk management division is funded. Risk Management is led by Tina Paquette,

02:49.642 --> 02:53.406
Assistant Director who is also here today. Risk Management handles all

02:53.428 --> 02:56.346
of the commercial insurance for the city of Houston. Next slide,

02:56.378 --> 03:00.746
please. The Central Services revolving

03:00.778 --> 03:04.130
fund is a chargeback fund. You've heard from many of the directors here today

03:04.200 --> 03:08.226
that they run services through the revolving fund. We do as well.

03:08.328 --> 03:12.214
There's no FTEs assigned to this because those are reflected in

03:12.252 --> 03:14.230
other places throughout our budget.

03:15.690 --> 03:19.186
But this is where the costs for the citywide mailroom, the citywide print

03:19.218 --> 03:22.898
shop, citywide payroll services and employee transit are flowed

03:22.914 --> 03:26.646
through. Next slide, please. And these

03:26.668 --> 03:29.990
are the categories of service that Arie provides and the statutory

03:30.070 --> 03:33.846
mandates that require us to provide those services. Next slide,

03:33.878 --> 03:37.626
please. And these are the penalties for failure

03:37.658 --> 03:41.102
to provide the mandated services. Because Ara is

03:41.156 --> 03:45.054
primarily a regulatory department, the majority of our services are

03:45.092 --> 03:47.882
mandated by either federal, state or local ordinances.

03:48.026 --> 03:52.418
And the penalties for nondelvery of those services can be anything from

03:52.584 --> 03:55.874
substantial financial penalties as they are for payroll to even

03:55.912 --> 03:58.100
criminal penalties. Next slide, please.

04:00.310 --> 04:03.634
This slide summarizes our general fund revenues as

04:03.672 --> 04:06.902
well as our special fund revenues. As you can see,

04:07.036 --> 04:10.790
our estimated General Fund revenues for FY 23 will be down

04:10.860 --> 04:15.238
by $1.9 million compared to year end FY 22,

04:15.404 --> 04:19.382
primarily due to franchise fee decreases. As you can see from this slide,

04:19.446 --> 04:23.334
the biggest single loss will be telephone franchise fees.

04:23.382 --> 04:26.426
And these will continue to drop every year because they're based on the number of

04:26.448 --> 04:29.946
landlines in Houston. And most of us don't use landlines

04:29.978 --> 04:33.210
anymore. We also had a drop in our permitting revenues.

04:33.290 --> 04:37.130
This is mainly from alcohol licenses and taxicab permits.

04:37.290 --> 04:40.350
One bright spot in our revenue picture, even though it's small,

04:40.420 --> 04:44.590
is a source of revenues called Das facilities or network nodes.

04:44.750 --> 04:48.126
With the expansion of 5G, this source of revenue

04:48.158 --> 04:52.226
is actually going up. It produces currently about $2 million a year. There is a

04:52.248 --> 04:56.246
52% growth in this that's projected for FY 23.

04:56.428 --> 04:59.702
We also administer two special funds the Bark Special

04:59.756 --> 05:03.014
Revenue and the Park Houston Special Revenue Fund. As you can

05:03.052 --> 05:06.346
see, we don't expect much growth in the Bark Special Revenue Fund. This is

05:06.368 --> 05:10.106
primarily not an area that produces revenues. The little bit that

05:10.128 --> 05:13.754
we do produce is in adoption fees, license fees and

05:13.792 --> 05:17.926
wellness services. And because it is so hard to find veterinarians

05:18.038 --> 05:21.566
these days, we had another resignation today. It is very difficult to

05:21.588 --> 05:24.906
provide these services. So our revenues are not expected to come back up in FY

05:24.938 --> 05:28.126
23 for parking. However, we do

05:28.148 --> 05:31.566
have a better story. Post pandemic. Houstonians are

05:31.588 --> 05:35.266
getting back out. They're starting to park in all of our inner city areas and

05:35.288 --> 05:39.234
they're using parking meters. So this year they're projected to increase by about

05:39.272 --> 05:42.610
7% or 1.3 million. We're also

05:42.680 --> 05:46.706
projecting increases in the revolving funds. Now remember, these are not revenues.

05:46.818 --> 05:50.710
These are just paying back the general Fund for costs. So what you see there

05:50.780 --> 05:54.166
in the $1.7 million increase from FY 22 to

05:54.188 --> 05:57.322
FY 23 is the 10% increase in the property

05:57.376 --> 06:00.780
insurance premiums for the City of Houston. Next slide, please.

06:02.590 --> 06:06.026
On the previous slide, I showed you all of the individual categories of

06:06.048 --> 06:09.786
general fund revenues and the anticipated decline for FY 23. So I

06:09.808 --> 06:12.926
won't go into a lot of detail on this one because this just provides the

06:12.948 --> 06:15.966
narrative for everything that I just said. But I do want to highlight three

06:15.988 --> 06:19.438
things. First is electricity Revenues CenterPoint remains the

06:19.444 --> 06:23.122
highest source of revenues to the City of Houston, paying us $95 million a year

06:23.176 --> 06:26.802
for the use of our streets. Telephone franchise fees are the second

06:26.856 --> 06:30.334
highest fee that we collect. And as I said, this is a rapidly

06:30.382 --> 06:33.826
disappearing source of franchise fees. At one point it was $60 million.

06:33.928 --> 06:37.606
It's down to $17 million. We can count on that decreasing every

06:37.628 --> 06:41.574
budget year when I'm here. And cable TV franchise fees also are

06:41.612 --> 06:45.026
disappearing because many of us are using Netflix and Hulu and prime,

06:45.058 --> 06:49.254
and we're not using cable TV anymore. So that is also a rapidly disappearing

06:49.302 --> 06:53.050
source of revenue. So the takeaway from this slide is that

06:53.120 --> 06:57.422
between decreasing telephone and cable franchise fees, you're losing almost $30

06:57.476 --> 07:01.294
million. And that accounts for $30 million in the general fund

07:01.332 --> 07:04.080
budget. Next year. You can expect that to be much lower.

07:07.090 --> 07:10.702
The next slide, please. On this slide we talk about

07:10.756 --> 07:14.258
more detail related to revenues. Permanent and license revenues, as I

07:14.264 --> 07:17.966
said, had gone down because alcohol establishments were closed during the pandemic.

07:17.998 --> 07:21.342
And that's where we get many of our fees as well as taxicab permits.

07:21.486 --> 07:24.770
Taxicabs had already been decimated by the TNCs.

07:24.930 --> 07:28.790
This pretty effectively eliminated the industry.

07:29.130 --> 07:32.722
And as always, we do attempt to offset our revenue losses

07:32.786 --> 07:36.346
through aggressive auditing and aggressive compliance efforts. This year,

07:36.368 --> 07:40.010
we expect to collect $300,000 in delinquent

07:40.350 --> 07:43.420
revenues just based on those audits. Next slide, please.

07:44.990 --> 07:48.854
And just as I showed all of the funds that we administer on the revenue

07:48.902 --> 07:51.918
slide, this slide summarizes the expenditures for all of

07:51.924 --> 07:55.242
the funds that are administered by Ara. I highlighted

07:55.306 --> 07:58.526
in yellow the row with the general fund expenditures since I know that's what

07:58.548 --> 08:01.838
you're most interested in. And in a few minutes, when we get to the

08:01.844 --> 08:05.314
net change slide, I'll actually walk you through in detailed that

08:05.352 --> 08:09.186
revenue increase of 1.34 million. But for now, we're going to

08:09.208 --> 08:12.474
talk about the special funds. First up is Park Houston.

08:12.622 --> 08:16.166
The increase in expenditures that you see here is based on

08:16.188 --> 08:19.782
two sources. The first is the addition of FTEs for a new

08:19.836 --> 08:23.718
planned fourth shift for compliance. The second

08:23.804 --> 08:27.720
is an increase in the transfer of revenue to the general fund.

08:28.430 --> 08:31.494
As I said before, we didn't have people parking during the pandemic,

08:31.542 --> 08:35.114
so the transfer to the general fund was much smaller. For FY 23,

08:35.152 --> 08:38.774
we were projecting to transfer $5.5 million from the parking

08:38.822 --> 08:42.814
special revenue fund to the general fund, an increase of $2 million

08:42.852 --> 08:46.778
over what we were able to do this year. The next special fund is Bark.

08:46.874 --> 08:50.574
Bark is the opposite of park. Houston. Rather than transferring money to

08:50.612 --> 08:54.050
the general fund, bark receives money from the general fund.

08:54.120 --> 08:58.130
For FY 23, they'll be receiving 10.8 million. For FY 22,

08:58.200 --> 09:02.142
it was 10.5 million. And finally, in the property casualty

09:02.206 --> 09:05.666
fund, you see the increase there. Again, that's an increase in both revenues

09:05.698 --> 09:08.920
and expenditures. It's a flow through fund. Next slide, please.

09:10.330 --> 09:13.894
And this is the graphical representation of the proposed FY 23

09:13.932 --> 09:17.334
general fund budget. As you can see, the biggest pieces of this

09:17.372 --> 09:21.274
budget are personnel, which is 54% of the budget, or 17.3

09:21.312 --> 09:24.886
million. The second biggest piece is the $10.8 million

09:24.918 --> 09:28.534
transfer to BARC which is 34% of our total expenditure budget.

09:28.662 --> 09:32.462
And then finally, the restricted accounts represent more than half of the 12%

09:32.516 --> 09:37.134
that remains of Ara's General Fund expenditure budget. So only 1.6%

09:37.252 --> 09:41.210
of our total $32.2 million FY 23 proposed budget

09:41.290 --> 09:44.894
is what you might call discretionary meaning that it's not already obligated

09:44.942 --> 09:48.846
to personnel or some sort of contractual or mandated obligation but it's

09:48.958 --> 09:51.406
available for supplies and services. Next slide,

09:51.438 --> 09:55.186
please. This is the same breakdown for the Bark

09:55.218 --> 09:58.774
Special Revenue Fund. Bark's proposed budget is what?

09:58.812 --> 10:02.342
13.3 million. And as I said before, the lion's share of that is the

10:02.396 --> 10:06.058
$10.8 million transfer from the General Fund

10:06.144 --> 10:09.174
in Bark. 67% is personnel expenses.

10:09.302 --> 10:12.506
Next slide piece. And this is

10:12.528 --> 10:15.180
the breakdown for the park houston Special Revenue Fund.

10:15.710 --> 10:19.298
Personnel is 34% of the expenditures of this special revenue

10:19.334 --> 10:22.542
fund. The other big piece of this is 26%

10:22.596 --> 10:26.126
which is the transfer from the Park Houston Special Revenue Fund

10:26.148 --> 10:28.240
to the General Fund. Next slide, please.

10:29.810 --> 10:33.262
And this is the breakdown for Ara's portion of the Property Casualty

10:33.326 --> 10:36.626
Service Fund. Again, this is where our risk management group is

10:36.648 --> 10:40.274
funded. You'll notice that only 3% of this fund

10:40.472 --> 10:44.226
goes to pay for personnel. 97% is insurance premiums

10:44.258 --> 10:46.600
for the City of Houston. Next slide, please.

10:48.730 --> 10:52.386
This is the more complicated slide. There's five blocks

10:52.418 --> 10:55.586
here and we're going to walk through those as quickly as we can while giving

10:55.628 --> 10:59.206
you the detail. Our current budget is broken

10:59.238 --> 11:03.034
out. At the top block, you'll see $17.75 million.

11:03.152 --> 11:06.166
That's our actual FY 22 operating budget.

11:06.278 --> 11:10.110
These are the funds that are available for the General Fund operations of our department.

11:10.450 --> 11:14.622
Added to that amount is the restricted accounts, totally 2.48

11:14.676 --> 11:18.334
million. And then the General Fund transfer to Bark, which is 10.5

11:18.372 --> 11:22.058
million in FY 22. So if you add the restricted items

11:22.074 --> 11:26.194
for FY 22 plus the transfer to Bark, which was 10.5

11:26.232 --> 11:29.538
the total operating budget that was not available to Ara and

11:29.544 --> 11:33.282
FY 22 was $12.6 million leaving only

11:33.336 --> 11:36.150
the 17.74 million for our operations.

11:36.890 --> 11:40.322
The next block is called Adjustments to FY 22 budget.

11:40.386 --> 11:43.766
These are the amounts that were added or taken out of our budget during the

11:43.788 --> 11:47.634
current fiscal year. And so you have things like the contractual

11:47.682 --> 11:51.802
hope, municipal pay raises and the amount of $283,000 for the General Fund

11:51.856 --> 11:55.366
and $161,000 for Bark. A restricted

11:55.398 --> 11:58.080
accounts adjustment of $71,000.

11:58.530 --> 12:02.314
$21,000 received from Council member Cisneros's Budget Surplus

12:02.362 --> 12:05.786
Fund to fund spay neuter efforts for Bark.

12:05.978 --> 12:09.434
A $17,000 adjustment for scanning services related

12:09.482 --> 12:13.030
to the records retention project at the City Secretary's office which Ara

12:13.050 --> 12:17.762
is managing. And then the last item in the second block is a $117,000

12:17.816 --> 12:21.778
increase for Bark shelter, cleaning and a rescue initiative. Those are explained in

12:21.784 --> 12:25.414
footnote three. Altogether, these items yield a net increase from

12:25.452 --> 12:29.302
our FY 22 budget of $527,000

12:29.436 --> 12:32.966
bringing the FY 222 year end adjusted budget to

12:32.988 --> 12:36.726
$30.83 million. And then in the next section, you see the

12:36.748 --> 12:40.570
operating budget adjustments that get us to FY 23.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.866
These are the amounts that are added to or reduced from the

12:43.888 --> 12:47.434
FY 22 budget to get us here. So the $21,000.01 time

12:47.472 --> 12:50.778
receipt from Council Member Cisneros from her budget surplus

12:50.874 --> 12:54.894
would be subtracted out in FY 23. You'll also

12:54.932 --> 12:58.314
see $216,000 of onetime funds from an FY

12:58.362 --> 13:01.754
22 budget amendment, and the details of those are spelled out in footnote

13:01.802 --> 13:06.082
five. And then in the third block, you also see $328,000

13:06.136 --> 13:09.586
being added to fund various one time programs, including the three one

13:09.608 --> 13:13.842
one hiring initiative. And then the details for the $328,000

13:13.896 --> 13:16.898
are laid out for you in footnote four. And I'll also go through those in

13:16.904 --> 13:19.938
just a second on the next slide. So when you net out the reductions and

13:19.944 --> 13:23.914
the increases in that third block, we end up with a $91,000 net

13:23.992 --> 13:27.286
increase to Ara's budget for specific programs for FY

13:27.318 --> 13:31.030
23. Continuing down the page, we're now to the fourth block.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.934
You see our contractual or mandated adjustments, and this includes

13:34.982 --> 13:38.102
the increases for health benefits, hope, contractual pay raises,

13:38.166 --> 13:41.710
municipal pension costs and restricted accounts. The total

13:41.780 --> 13:45.306
is an increase of $1.25 million to the Ara

13:45.338 --> 13:48.586
budget. And finally, in the fifth block, we arrive

13:48.618 --> 13:52.254
at the proposed FY 23 budget of 32.174

13:52.292 --> 13:55.714
million. And as you can see, the Ara General Fund budget is

13:55.752 --> 13:58.930
increasing by 1.34 million. But of that amount,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.718
only $91,000 is an actual increase to our operating budget.

14:02.814 --> 14:06.466
Everything else is a contractual or mandated amount. At the bottom block,

14:06.498 --> 14:10.178
you have the page that contains the footnotes that detail every adjustment I just discussed.

14:10.274 --> 14:14.306
Next slide, please. And then this slide summarizes

14:14.338 --> 14:17.882
the big picture expenditure changes that we discussed on the previous slide for the General

14:17.936 --> 14:22.010
Fund, as well as the highlights of our special fund expenditures.

14:23.070 --> 14:26.554
So in addition to the increases for health benefits, pension contribution and

14:26.592 --> 14:30.050
municipal employee contractual pay increases across all funds,

14:30.230 --> 14:33.966
let me reiterate into the general fund the adjustments that are being made are the

14:33.988 --> 14:38.026
$36,000 in one time funding. For the City Secretary records

14:38.058 --> 14:41.646
retention project, the $20,991 in

14:41.668 --> 14:45.154
funding for a hiring incentive to recruit and retain new three

14:45.192 --> 14:49.234
one one agents and $224,861

14:49.272 --> 14:52.722
in resilience funding transferred from the Planning Department to

14:52.776 --> 14:56.466
Ara for the Resilience and Sustainability Office. For the Bark

14:56.498 --> 14:59.954
Special Fund, we received $256,000 for a shelter

15:00.002 --> 15:03.954
cleaning contract, $30,000 for a rescue incentive

15:04.002 --> 15:07.910
program, $39,000 for the Pep Microchipping Initiative,

15:07.990 --> 15:11.580
and then a reduction of FY 22

15:12.110 --> 15:14.586
non recurring program adjustments of $563,000.

15:14.608 --> 15:18.646
And finally, for Park Houston, we received

15:18.678 --> 15:22.346
program adjustments funding for ten additional employees to add a fourth

15:22.378 --> 15:25.806
shift of compliance officers. And we realized after we published this

15:25.828 --> 15:29.214
slide that there is an error on the Park Houston bullet. The amount

15:29.252 --> 15:32.674
for the fourth shift is $280,000, and the slide shows

15:32.712 --> 15:35.966
$256,402. Next slide,

15:35.998 --> 15:39.662
please. This concludes our budget presentation

15:39.726 --> 15:43.246
please note that our restricted accounts details, organization charts,

15:43.358 --> 15:47.634
demographics and other relevant materials are included as appendices to this presentation,

15:47.762 --> 15:51.186
including the top three one one service requests for each one of your council

15:51.218 --> 15:54.554
districts. Thank you for your attention. Thank you,

15:54.592 --> 15:57.370
Director. So,

15:57.520 --> 16:01.046
just forward thinking some of your revenue

16:01.078 --> 16:03.850
sources, like cable and television.

16:04.670 --> 16:07.962
We're seeing reduced revenues coming in

16:08.016 --> 16:12.094
because of less usage. So thinking about

16:12.132 --> 16:15.374
the future, what are some creative ideas or ways in which you think we

16:15.412 --> 16:19.146
can generate more revenue? Is there anything in the pipeline maybe discussed

16:19.178 --> 16:22.542
at the state level that you can see that would generate more

16:22.596 --> 16:25.618
revenue through fees? So at the state level,

16:25.704 --> 16:29.074
they have continued to erode our fees. For example, when they took away

16:29.112 --> 16:32.146
TNCs, that would have been a $70 million revenue by now.

16:32.328 --> 16:35.842
Network nodes by now would have been $40

16:35.896 --> 16:39.078
million revenue. But that was also decimated at the state level.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.326
It's still a growing revenue, but by no means the size that it would have

16:42.348 --> 16:45.986
been. And so what the mayor charged us with was finding

16:46.018 --> 16:48.982
anything in the right of way that we were not charging fees for already,

16:49.036 --> 16:52.170
because again, it belongs to the public and the public should be reimbursed for it.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.642
And that's what we've tasked our group to do. We're speaking to public works

16:55.696 --> 16:59.326
about what things that they are charging permitting fees for that should

16:59.348 --> 17:02.586
actually be rental because the city charter does call for uses

17:02.618 --> 17:05.978
in the right of way to be reimbursed as rental rather than permit

17:05.994 --> 17:10.080
fees. Thank you, Council Member Amy Pick.

17:10.610 --> 17:13.470
Thank you, Vice Chair. And thank you, Director, for the presentation.

17:13.830 --> 17:17.426
Can you talk a little bit more about three one one and anything that

17:17.448 --> 17:20.706
might be in the budget to fix the three one one app and

17:20.728 --> 17:24.274
the three one system this next fiscal year? I'm very

17:24.312 --> 17:27.938
glad you brought that up because we are completely expecting

17:27.954 --> 17:31.666
that by the end of the year we'll have a new app. When we rolled

17:31.698 --> 17:34.774
out the new three one one system, we were excited about it because it has

17:34.812 --> 17:37.830
all kinds of really cool functionality if you're at your desktop.

17:38.410 --> 17:41.846
And we thought that what most people wanted, based on the customer feedback

17:41.878 --> 17:45.386
that we'd gotten, was to be able to figure out what the status of their

17:45.408 --> 17:48.554
service request was. That was the single biggest complaint we got under the old

17:48.592 --> 17:51.806
system. And when you use the old app, it changed the

17:51.828 --> 17:55.454
number of your service request. By the time you got to

17:55.652 --> 17:58.798
the actual system and went into the web to check it, everybody was angry about

17:58.804 --> 18:03.002
that. So we thought what we're going to do instead is optimize the desktop

18:03.066 --> 18:06.386
app for mobile and then everyone will have all the information they want. And what

18:06.408 --> 18:09.646
we didn't realize was that what customers also wanted to do was take pictures

18:09.678 --> 18:13.794
and be able to drop a GIS pin. So the new app

18:13.992 --> 18:17.266
is going to have the best features of all of that. We're going back to

18:17.288 --> 18:20.726
Cclick Fix, which was the app we used before, but we're enhancing it

18:20.748 --> 18:24.530
now so that it has a lot of the neat functional features that we added

18:24.610 --> 18:28.374
to the desktop app. And it will also include the neat things about

18:28.412 --> 18:31.498
picture taking in GIS. And that will be out before the end of the year.

18:31.664 --> 18:35.066
So how much money did we spend on going to

18:35.088 --> 18:38.666
this new three one one app? And are we just out that money that we

18:38.688 --> 18:42.014
spent transferring over and then going back? So the new app

18:42.052 --> 18:45.626
was actually in the original development cost of the whole system. It wasn't

18:45.658 --> 18:49.086
a separate cost. It actually was not something that was very

18:49.108 --> 18:53.086
hard for Accenture to do because all that they did was optimize the

18:53.108 --> 18:56.958
desktop app. So that wasn't a cost. And it's not a matter of recouping

18:56.974 --> 19:00.066
that there is a cost to the new app that's coming up and there will

19:00.088 --> 19:03.378
be a new contract that Hits will actually be bringing to you to approve

19:03.394 --> 19:05.960
and vet. Okay, thank you.

19:07.210 --> 19:10.454
Council member Abby Cayman. Hi,

19:10.492 --> 19:14.390
Director. First off, to all of your

19:14.540 --> 19:17.882
divisions. I don't know how Ara encompasses so

19:17.936 --> 19:21.958
much. It's truly extraordinary. But my staff

19:21.974 --> 19:25.466
just did a tour of three one one, and I cannot thank the

19:25.488 --> 19:29.406
operators enough there. The retention, the knowledge that they have

19:29.428 --> 19:32.734
is extraordinary. Bark I know that

19:32.772 --> 19:36.234
times have been really challenging. I think you just mentioned we just lost

19:36.282 --> 19:38.270
another veterinarian.

19:40.050 --> 19:44.222
What are we trying to do to recruit right now other than financial

19:44.286 --> 19:47.666
incentives for veterinarians? I know that has been an

19:47.688 --> 19:51.074
issue even before coming into office, and I know I even

19:51.112 --> 19:54.342
talked to veterinarian offices around the city,

19:54.396 --> 19:58.534
or at least in my district. Same thing. It's hard right now.

19:58.652 --> 20:01.654
What else are we looking at in terms of that right now?

20:01.772 --> 20:05.046
It's a national shortage. So what we used to

20:05.068 --> 20:07.782
do was regularly just go around the country and poach.

20:07.926 --> 20:11.306
And now most veterinarians who are graduating do not

20:11.328 --> 20:14.966
want to do shelter medicine. If they're going to do veterinary

20:14.998 --> 20:17.706
medicine at all, they want to work in a private practice where they get to

20:17.728 --> 20:22.258
use the cool new technology and do a lot of diagnostics spaying

20:22.294 --> 20:25.518
and neutering. Not the most fun thing to do. So it's hard.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.526
One of the things that we'd like to do is start an internship program with

20:28.548 --> 20:32.400
one of the universities, and Council member Cisnero's led an effort toward that.

20:32.850 --> 20:36.386
We haven't gotten much traction with A and M, honestly, but now

20:36.408 --> 20:39.666
we're looking at going national with any other vet school that's willing to partner with

20:39.688 --> 20:43.042
us. And we would find a way to pay for their interns that come here,

20:43.096 --> 20:46.486
even if it's through private funding. But we're working with best friends and some

20:46.508 --> 20:49.686
of our other partners locally to try to troubleshoot that. And I

20:49.708 --> 20:53.398
appreciate the partnership with outside organizations. I also wanted to

20:53.404 --> 20:55.110
give a huge shout out to parking.

20:56.590 --> 21:00.250
Incredible job, especially dealing with a lot of the challenges that we face

21:00.320 --> 21:03.542
inside the District and obviously the Office of Resiliency

21:03.606 --> 21:06.906
and Sustainability, that's going to be monumental and historic

21:06.938 --> 21:10.206
work that's taking place there. Two quick questions.

21:10.308 --> 21:14.446
Three quick questions. One, scanning for all

21:14.468 --> 21:17.934
of our records and archiving, is that really happening? That's really

21:17.972 --> 21:21.758
happening. The mayor asked us last year or

21:21.764 --> 21:24.746
the year before to go over to city secretary's office and at least start boxing

21:24.778 --> 21:27.474
everything up to get it organized. And we did that, and she has been so

21:27.512 --> 21:30.882
welcoming to us and working with us on that. And then he gave us money

21:30.936 --> 21:34.670
to start the scanning project. We're actually working with the state of Texas.

21:34.750 --> 21:37.986
They have someone who archives all of their records, and we're sending

21:38.018 --> 21:41.346
up 100 boxes at a time to get them scanned and make them searchable.

21:41.378 --> 21:44.838
Because remember, there's no point in having them just be PDFs. They need to be

21:44.844 --> 21:47.750
searchable PDFs. Okay. And do we have a timeline,

21:47.830 --> 21:51.306
estimated timeline for completion on that? The mayor wants it

21:51.328 --> 21:54.874
done before he leaves. Okay, understood. Can I be

21:54.912 --> 21:58.590
placed back in queue, please? You're back in the queue

22:00.050 --> 22:01.440
now. All right,

22:03.650 --> 22:07.262
director, one thing I wanted to bring up, and I'm happy

22:07.316 --> 22:10.654
to talk offline about it, but last year council did pass

22:10.692 --> 22:14.290
an amendment that I drafted related to and first off,

22:14.360 --> 22:17.970
thank you to the department for all of the work on the sound ordinance changes

22:18.040 --> 22:22.110
thus far. Sally is like, yes, huge victory.

22:22.270 --> 22:25.542
There was one other thing we had asked the department to look at, which is

22:25.596 --> 22:28.150
weekend hours as it relates to construction.

22:28.490 --> 22:32.178
Right now, there's no distinction between weekday and weekends.

22:32.274 --> 22:35.446
We're getting construction 07:00 a.m. Saturdays and

22:35.468 --> 22:37.930
Sundays, and residents need a reprieve.

22:38.990 --> 22:42.778
Again, we had set a timeline for the end of this fiscal year, and I

22:42.784 --> 22:45.914
know it's coming up, so I just wanted to check on

22:45.952 --> 22:49.834
the status of that. If you all are ready to proceed with stakeholder

22:49.882 --> 22:53.854
meetings on that and what we can do. We have not even

22:53.892 --> 22:58.190
begun that the changes to the noise ordinance that we made took so much longer

22:58.260 --> 23:01.406
than anyone anticipated they were going to make with stakeholders that we put this

23:01.428 --> 23:04.674
on the back burner because, remember, it was a whole different group of stakeholders than

23:04.712 --> 23:08.098
restaurants and everyone else. So that's something I have to circle back with with the

23:08.104 --> 23:11.394
mayor and ask him if we can now start having those stakeholder meetings for

23:11.432 --> 23:14.598
that. Okay. If we could talk offline about that and just come up with kind

23:14.604 --> 23:18.342
of a plan of attack, our residents would really

23:18.396 --> 23:21.734
appreciate it. And then lastly, you've addressed a lot

23:21.772 --> 23:25.254
of needs. Is there anything else that you want to mention to us

23:25.292 --> 23:28.774
that we need to be aware of in terms of upcoming needs in the foreseeable

23:28.822 --> 23:31.642
future, given how tight this budget is?

23:31.776 --> 23:35.386
So you've been asking every department that question. So we

23:35.408 --> 23:38.554
thought a lot about it. And the mayor has been very good about giving one

23:38.592 --> 23:41.798
time money where it was needed. For example, for our hiring initiative for three one

23:41.824 --> 23:44.926
one. By the way, our turnaround time right now, our average speed of

23:44.948 --> 23:48.126
Anderson for three one one is consistently less than a minute. So you should be

23:48.148 --> 23:51.878
very happy to hear that. But our biggest need is embark.

23:51.994 --> 23:55.154
We can't keep people, we can't hire people. We consistently have

23:55.192 --> 23:59.166
between a 20% to 35% vacancy in that division. And it's

23:59.198 --> 24:02.482
not even an animal enforcement officers, believe it or not. We can keep those.

24:02.536 --> 24:05.886
It's the people who clean the shelter every day. So the mayor

24:05.918 --> 24:09.538
said, well, okay, if we don't have enough people to keep the shelter clean and

24:09.544 --> 24:13.266
then also be able to feed and water and treat the animals, let's get

24:13.288 --> 24:16.186
a cleaning contract in there and get some contractors in to clean it to free

24:16.208 --> 24:19.338
up the employees. We did that and you see the money here for it.

24:19.424 --> 24:22.826
The first week they showed up, they came with four people and three of them

24:22.848 --> 24:26.330
left and said, this is not my gig. I'm not doing this. So we're still

24:26.400 --> 24:29.900
troubleshooting that, but our single biggest need is people.

24:31.630 --> 24:35.134
Understood? Thank you. And again, thank you to the there's a lot of people back

24:35.172 --> 24:38.320
there. Thank you all for everything that you do.

24:39.670 --> 24:42.546
Yeah, you want to have your team stand up in the back so we can

24:42.568 --> 24:44.100
say hello and thank you.

24:46.550 --> 24:48.740
Thank you all for everything that you do.

24:51.670 --> 24:55.106
We know you make the most out of a little and we appreciate all

24:55.128 --> 24:58.534
your efforts, all the engagement with our offices and look forward

24:58.572 --> 25:01.058
to working with you in the days ahead. So thank you, Director and Ms.

25:01.074 --> 25:04.146
Barry for your presentation. And you are dismissed. Thank you,

25:04.188 --> 25:08.250
sir. We'll now move to the public comment period.

25:09.150 --> 25:12.890
We'll start with the virtual public speakers. Please press star six

25:12.960 --> 25:16.986
to unmute when you hear your name. First name is Amanda

25:17.018 --> 25:17.600
she.

25:21.060 --> 25:22.450
Hello. Thank you.

25:24.420 --> 25:27.772
Does Ara or any other department do analysis

25:27.836 --> 25:31.072
on the three one one calls to identify broad

25:31.136 --> 25:33.940
or persistent gaps in service delivery?

25:36.520 --> 25:40.244
That's a great question. I would like to know the answer to that

25:40.282 --> 25:44.276
myself. We will respond to that question

25:44.378 --> 25:48.344
within 48 hours. So if you want to, please send that over to District E

25:48.382 --> 25:52.330
at houstontx Gov, we'll get a response for you.

25:54.060 --> 25:56.350
Do you have any other questions, Ms. She?

25:58.880 --> 26:01.612
No, I do not. Thank you. Thank you.

26:01.746 --> 26:05.180
Saba Blanding. Hi.

26:05.330 --> 26:08.816
I know staff has already been discussed. I was

26:08.838 --> 26:13.004
just curious if there were any additional financial resources Bark

26:13.052 --> 26:16.240
needed to address Houston's stray population.

26:18.180 --> 26:21.424
I'm sure additional resources are greatly needed and

26:21.462 --> 26:24.692
appreciated. Many of our offices use our council district service

26:24.746 --> 26:28.096
funds to also put through projects to work with Bark and Houston Humane

26:28.128 --> 26:32.052
Society for spay and neuter programs. So if you want to reach

26:32.106 --> 26:35.620
out to your district council member on ways in which to

26:35.770 --> 26:39.412
understand the money that they may be allocating or any of the eleven

26:39.476 --> 26:43.764
district council members. We'll be able to provide that information to you. But pretty regularly

26:43.812 --> 26:47.212
around the city of Houston, the District council members are putting

26:47.266 --> 26:50.830
forth spay and neuter programs for the public to

26:51.760 --> 26:53.950
take notice of and be a part of.

26:55.440 --> 26:59.520
Thank you. You're welcome. Jason Oliver.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.740
My first question follows up on Amanda.

27:05.900 --> 27:08.960
I definitely am interested in the three one one analysis.

27:09.700 --> 27:13.524
I'd also like to know about what other performance measures Ara has

27:13.562 --> 27:17.780
for three one one call. Answering time is important and

27:17.930 --> 27:21.488
as it shows, there's major room for improvement.

27:21.584 --> 27:25.000
But I'd also like to know just see more metrics around the service,

27:25.070 --> 27:31.156
around service delivery. And then second harkening

27:31.188 --> 27:34.420
back to fleet management metrics. The city consistently

27:34.500 --> 27:37.916
uses around 10 million gallons of fuel every year.

27:38.018 --> 27:41.416
Where does fuel reduction show up in the city's sustainability plans?

27:41.448 --> 27:44.030
And how are we doing with that?

27:46.720 --> 27:50.224
Council Member David Robinson. Mr. Oliver, another great question from

27:50.262 --> 27:52.844
you about our fuel goals.

27:52.892 --> 27:56.128
That the reduction of our

27:56.294 --> 27:59.968
reliance on both petroleum gas products

28:00.054 --> 28:03.716
is in both our Climate Action Plan as well as

28:03.738 --> 28:07.024
the Resilient Houston plan. The exact section and reference

28:07.072 --> 28:10.420
and goals are outlined in that.

28:10.490 --> 28:13.590
So I again commend you for the good question.

28:13.900 --> 28:17.016
We can help you locate that if you're unaware of that or

28:17.038 --> 28:20.890
otherwise get an update for you about the current status of

28:21.580 --> 28:25.210
attaining those goals. Thanks for the question.

28:26.140 --> 28:29.336
Thank you. I'll check the reports and see what we've

28:29.368 --> 28:32.696
got. There are no additional public speakers.

28:32.728 --> 28:36.568
And this concludes our Administrative and Regulatory Affairs budget workshop.

28:36.664 --> 28:40.508
We will now move to begin our budget workshop

28:40.604 --> 28:44.304
for municipal courts. I believe

28:44.342 --> 28:48.224
that we had other speakers in the audience who

28:48.262 --> 28:51.910
signed up. They were on the list emailed to us.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.020
Good catch.

28:56.120 --> 29:00.544
Our first in person public speaker is Meredith

29:00.592 --> 29:03.060
Powell. Meredith Powell.

29:10.210 --> 29:12.480
Luckily, Amy recognizes me.

29:14.690 --> 29:17.930
Thank you. Ms. Powell, the floor is yours. Thank you. Good afternoon,

29:18.090 --> 29:22.034
council members. My name is Meredith Powell. I live in district a

29:22.232 --> 29:25.918
by profession. I'm a communications and community relations consultant.

29:26.094 --> 29:29.486
I'm also the president of my neighborhood association, so Council member Peck

29:29.518 --> 29:31.730
and her staff hear from me regularly.

29:32.870 --> 29:36.674
I'm very passionate about animal welfare issues and I

29:36.712 --> 29:39.906
recognize the role for Bark. I'm not one of those people who's like Bark

29:39.938 --> 29:43.154
is bad and all of that kind of stuff. I'm here to encourage

29:43.202 --> 29:47.100
you all, whether it is within your own districts or

29:47.470 --> 29:50.890
as a council, to increase resources as much as possible

29:50.960 --> 29:56.518
for Bark. Because thousands

29:56.534 --> 29:59.734
of animals live on the street and need rescuing. And while there are many rescue

29:59.782 --> 30:03.326
groups and street rescuers like myself, we can only do

30:03.348 --> 30:06.634
so much. I work with Rpm and straight out of Texas to transport

30:06.682 --> 30:10.666
animals as much as possible. But I encourage you to give as many resources

30:10.698 --> 30:14.242
to Bark. Because if we don't give resources to Bark and animal. Control.

30:14.296 --> 30:18.206
It just exacerbates the problem that we're having because we have stray

30:18.318 --> 30:22.194
animals on the street that are not fixed. And it's just creating even

30:22.232 --> 30:24.420
more of a population that we're dealing with.

30:25.190 --> 30:29.158
So one of the things I wanted to raise is

30:29.244 --> 30:32.454
when we do the transport rescues, many of the people in other states ask,

30:32.492 --> 30:35.606
what is the problem with Houston? What is the city doing about it?

30:35.708 --> 30:39.242
And it makes us look really bad. I mean, Houston's leader in energy,

30:39.376 --> 30:42.410
space exploration, health care, all of these different things.

30:42.560 --> 30:46.426
Yet we get questions about what is the leadership position that

30:46.448 --> 30:49.340
Houston is taking to deal with the animal welfare issues.

30:49.870 --> 30:53.246
So I know we're working on microchip laws and I

30:53.268 --> 30:56.238
applaud city council and the city of doing those kind of things and stray and

30:56.244 --> 30:59.806
neuter efforts. I just encourage you to continue to provide resources to

30:59.828 --> 31:03.620
Bark to address our city's ongoing animal issue.

31:03.990 --> 31:07.646
Thank you. Are there some specific areas within Bark

31:07.678 --> 31:11.474
that you think the dollars would be most best utilized for? I mean,

31:11.512 --> 31:15.682
sometimes I see programs that I don't think make sense. I understand when

31:15.736 --> 31:19.366
we want to offer adoptions at low rates, but we also have

31:19.388 --> 31:23.074
to ensure that people who adopt at lower cost have the resources

31:23.122 --> 31:26.542
to pay for the animals, because then what happens is animal turnins

31:26.706 --> 31:31.130
or they release them as strays. So that's an issue. I think there's

31:31.550 --> 31:34.986
an opportunity for better public private partnership. We do

31:35.008 --> 31:38.778
so much with our theater district and sports and all of these areas where we

31:38.784 --> 31:42.206
have these huge companies who are supporting our efforts within the

31:42.228 --> 31:46.026
city. We don't really see that within Bark and animal control. I think that that's

31:46.058 --> 31:49.130
an opportunity. Great suggestion.

31:49.210 --> 31:52.814
Council member Amy Peck. Thank you, Meredith, for speaking today.

31:52.852 --> 31:55.186
And I just wanted to thank you for all the work that you do,

31:55.288 --> 31:58.510
especially in District A, when it comes to the animal population.

31:58.670 --> 32:02.206
She is constantly out there rescuing stray

32:02.238 --> 32:05.106
pets and doing so much work. So I just wanted to thank you for that

32:05.128 --> 32:09.030
and for coming today. Thank you. Council Member Abby Cayman

32:09.530 --> 32:13.074
I also just wanted to thank you for your efforts with Rescued Pets movement.

32:13.122 --> 32:16.726
I know we've partnered in our office with them in the efforts.

32:16.838 --> 32:19.980
My mom's even volunteering now. Really just

32:20.430 --> 32:24.406
amazing and beautiful work. I think your point about public private

32:24.438 --> 32:29.626
partnerships is dead on. And even including I

32:29.648 --> 32:32.986
was thinking, especially with the veterinarian shortage, how do we tap

32:33.018 --> 32:36.766
into the vet services that we already have in the city and that infrastructure and

32:36.788 --> 32:40.058
getting volunteers and things like that. So all that's

32:40.074 --> 32:43.214
to say, thank you. I really appreciate it. And I know

32:43.252 --> 32:46.658
Council Member Peck really respects and appreciates all the work that you do in the

32:46.664 --> 32:50.466
district. Thank you. And I encourage you to continue to reach out

32:50.488 --> 32:53.506
to Council Member Peck and any of us if you have any specific

32:53.608 --> 32:57.526
ideas. I know as the presentation was stated, that the

32:57.548 --> 33:01.154
mayor has a commitment to sometimes put one time funding sources

33:01.282 --> 33:04.902
towards specific needs with bark. And they still sometimes have

33:04.956 --> 33:08.698
challenges with recruitment, with retaining and with getting some of

33:08.704 --> 33:12.090
the services done. But any ideas? A person like yourself

33:12.160 --> 33:15.494
who has vast experience and understanding of the infrastructure

33:15.542 --> 33:19.066
of that entity would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so

33:19.088 --> 33:20.060
much. You're welcome.

33:23.630 --> 33:27.786
Are there any in person public speakers who

33:27.808 --> 33:29.020
would like to come forward?

33:32.460 --> 33:35.796
Well, now, this concludes our Administrative and Regulatory

33:35.828 --> 33:36.820
Affairs budget workshop.
