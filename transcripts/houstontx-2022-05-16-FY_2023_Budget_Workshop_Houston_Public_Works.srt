13
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,770
Our departments have been directed to provide written responses within

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,078
48 hours of the conclusion of their presentation to any questions

15
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:58,314

16
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:01,706
is posted on the BFA website. Questions from council

17
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:04,974
members can be uploaded at any time during the budget workshop

18
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:08,738
process, the earlier the better, allowing the departments plenty of

19
00:01:08,744 --> 00:01:12,034
time to provide responses. All public speakers should be

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,634

the public speakers list. The 2023

23
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:27,026
budget amendment template has also been uploaded to SharePoint. Mayor Turner

24
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:30,774
sent out a memo to all council members and council offices to ensure

25
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:34,310
a productive discussion on the 23 proposed budget.

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,154
Amendments are due Wednesday, May 25.

27
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:41,302

00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,270
As a reminder, only people attend in virtual or public speakers.

33
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,970
There are six virtual speakers signed up for public comment to speak,

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,002
and there are 13 people virtually

35
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:11,394
joining us. And we'll get their questions after the presentations

36
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:14,802
and questions from council members have been concluded.

37
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:18,294
I would like to welcome council member Sally

38
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:21,654
Alcorn at large position five, and staff

39
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:25,338
from Carlos Cisnero's office, council District H.

40
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:29,482
At this time, I'd like to welcome Director Carol Haddock and Mr.

41
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:33,194

update And Happy Public Works Week.

43
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:40,510
All right, thank you very much.

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,346
Good morning, everybody. Today we're here to discuss the fiscal

45
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:47,698
year 2023 budget for Houston Public Works. My name

46
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:51,086
is Carol Haddock, director of Houston Public Works. And I'm joined by my colleague,

47
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:55,266
Samir Solanki, chief financial officer for Houston Public Works. We have

48
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:58,354
other members of the Houston Public Works executive team

49
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:01,878
and also our budget team that have joined us in this meeting so that

50
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:04,920
we may answer questions on the spot if you may have them.

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,790
Next slide, please. Oh, wait, you're already at the next slide.

52
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,986
Houston Public Works aims to abide by our purpose and our five

53
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:16,538
to thrive values in all that we do. Together, we create a

54
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:20,186
strong foundation for Houston to thrive, and we do this every day by

55
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,582
doing the things that most people don't see or notice unless something

56
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:27,642
goes wrong. And we take great pride in that. We embody

57
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:31,434
our five to thrive values every day. We operate through integrity,

58
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:35,700
through teamwork. We take ownership of things we're responsible for.

59
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,398
We strive to communicate and we look for respect,

60
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:43,986
starting with ourselves, our colleagues, the citizens we

61
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:47,510
serve, this body and ultimately the city of Houston itself.

62
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,920
Next slide, please.

63
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,322
Houston Public Works Executive Teams consists of the capable

64
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:57,602
people that you see on this slide. At the end of this presentation,

65
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,334
there is a very extensive appendix. It shows all of our

66
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:04,506
accomplishments for fiscal year 2022, even though it's not

67
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:08,586
over yet. And while I would love to talk about our accomplishments, I am

68
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:11,418
going to skip that today and leave that for you to look at at the

69
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:15,086
back of the presentation. So please do take the time to

70
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:18,282
look through that as you go through it. Next slides,

71
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:21,722
please, for what you see on a day to day basis.

72
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:25,502
Our operational service lines, our five service lines that provide

73
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,410
the services. Our capital projects, customer account services,

74
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,374
houston Permitting Center, houston Water and Transportation and Drainage

75
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:38,094
operations. These service lines don't have a single cost

76
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,286
fund center. They actually have multiple funds, and most of them have

77
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:45,298
multiple cost centers. We have a long presentation

78
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:48,958
and I am going to hand this over to Samir Solanki to discuss the budget

79
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:51,610
for Houston Public Works at this time. Samir?

80
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,820
Thank you, Carol. Next slide, please.

81
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,546
Like Carol mentioned, this is a pretty significant presentation. We'll do our best

82
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:02,250
to try to get through all the information in the time that's allotted.

83
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,006
Like Carol had mentioned, public Works consists of several funds and this

84
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:10,778
slide summarizes the changes in revenues and expenditures from fiscal

85
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:13,918
year 2022 for each of these funds. I'm not going to

86
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:17,266
call out each of these numbers as we'll cover all of this in detail in

87
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:20,706
the upcoming slides. Please keep in mind that the variances are from the

88
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:24,590
FY 22 current budget. And because this is rolled slide,

89
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,118
these numbers are in millions. Once we get to each of the fund, we'll be

90
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:30,680
talking in thousands. Next slide, please.

91
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,310
First, we'll begin by discussing the General Fund.

92
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,578
Okay, there we go. Now, this is just an overview of

93
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:43,146
the major services requirements, impact and population served by

94
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:46,474
the General Fund within the Houston Public Works Department. Let's dig

95
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,858
a little deeper. The requirements for this service delivery.

96
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,270
Let me skip that part. Let's go to the next slide.

97
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,626
There we go. These are the revenue overviews.

98
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:03,770
For the revenue portion, a small amount is brought in from recoveries and refunds,

99
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,378
and majority of this is from sale of capital assets. Recoveries and

100
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:11,230
refunds are from the recovery of electricity costs for decorative lighting

101
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,802
that's above the city standard. Something like closer between

102
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:18,326
poles or higher wattage bulbs, which the city has paid to

103
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:22,034
CenterPoint and bills back to the corresponding management districts who request

104
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,506
the above standard lighting. Next slide,

105
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:29,206
please. The majority of

106
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:33,174
services for this portion of the General Fund is related to electricity for traffic

107
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:37,402
signals and street lights citywide, which is considered a restricted account

108
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:41,414
with no budgeted FTEs. The Real Estate Management section

109
00:06:41,462 --> 00:06:45,386
generates revenue for the General Fund by selling property and easements throughout

110
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,102
the Houston area, and this is accomplished by nine positions within

111
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:52,346
this fund. This section is also responsible for management

112
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,174
of Houston Public Works real estate inventory, including oversight

113
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:59,454
and management of city owned property interest such as streets,

114
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,958
easements, alleys and fee owned land and the process requests

115
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:06,626
for encroachment into streets or alleys through the Joint Referral Committee

116
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:10,626
process, the JRC process. Next slide,

117
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:14,438
please. Now we'll take

118
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:18,126
a look at the expenditures and this is a further breakdown of these expenditures

119
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:21,654
for the General Fund. The General Fund's largest expense consists

120
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:25,718
of the restricted accounts that I'd mentioned previously, which include service chargebacks

121
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:29,638
for fuels, electricity, It accounts and other items.

122
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:33,998
The projected budget for electricity in this fund is 21.4 million

123
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:37,742
due to transitioning from a floating rate to a locked in

124
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:41,600
electricity rate. Next slide, please.

125
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,158
Now, this chart is broken out by personnel and nonpersonal

126
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:52,846
items, and you'll notice that the largest amount is made up of restricted

127
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:56,886
accounts, that is primarily electricity, which is at 21.4

128
00:07:56,908 --> 00:08:00,840
million, and the It hits restricted accounts for about 300,000.

129
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,000
Next slide, please.

130
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,746
The Net Change slide walks through the items that contribute to

131
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:14,746
the increase in expenditures for the Houston Public Works portion of the

132
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:18,630
General Fund. The operating budget decreased slightly in supplies

133
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,918
based on spending trends as compared to fiscal year 22.

134
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:26,202
There were increases in contractual or mandated adjustments for restricted accounts

135
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:30,094
and interference services of about 700,000, as well as

136
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:33,946
17,000 increase in hope and benefit rates, which resulted

137
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:38,370
in an overall increase of 3.3% in the fiscal year 2023

138
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,900
budget. Next slide, please.

139
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,640
Now let's move on to the project cost recovery fund.

140
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,602
This slide provides an overview of the major services, requirements,

141
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:55,558
impacts and populations served by the Project Cost Recovery Fund.

142
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:59,446
This is a revolving fund and it derives its revenues from different funds

143
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:02,886
within Houston Public Works, which means that whatever revenues are brought

144
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,970
in must be fully expended.

145
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,886
Next slide. Got it. The Project Cost Recovery Fund

146
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:16,110
revenues are increasing from 51.9 million

147
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,014
to 55.7 million, for about a difference of 3.8

148
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:23,510
million. The project cost recovery fund expenses are increasing.

149
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,362
Excuse me. 2.8 million of this is due to increase in hope

150
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:31,086
and benefits, and the remaining increases are in restricted accounts,

151
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:33,730
interfund services and building maintenance.

152
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,440
Next slide, please.

153
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,042
And this is a program organizational chart which I'll go through individually.

154
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:49,126
The transportation and drainage Operations manages and analyzes traffic

155
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:52,566
calming patterns, collects data coordinates with regional partners

156
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:56,666
to develop transportation and drainage projects. The office of

157
00:09:56,688 --> 00:10:00,558
the Director administers the city's MWD program.

158
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:04,622
Then we have Houston Water, which manages contractual issues and other

159
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:08,778
required coordination related to the Northeast water purification

160
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,906
plant expansion. Then we have Financial Management Services that

161
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:16,702
processes the pay estimates and project reimbursements, provides financial

162
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,310
reports on project and grant related activities,

163
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,358
monitors and accounts for CIP related revenues and expenses.

164
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:26,694
Then we have Capital Projects, which is responsible for the

165
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:30,646
implementation of engineering and construction of infrastructure projects for

166
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:33,846
the City's adopted five year CIP plan.

167
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:38,058
Then there's also Information Technology, which provides and maintains technology

168
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:42,342
solutions to support planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance

169
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:46,054
of the public infrastructure systems, and also technically assists

170
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:49,786
the Houston Public Work inspectors to perform work and input data

171
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:53,722
into Cipms from remote sites. Then the managed support.

172
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:57,754
Finally, the Managed and Support Branch provides necessary funding to ensure

173
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:01,802
effective delivery of accurate, reliable and timely biweekly payroll

174
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:04,020
reports. Next slide please.

175
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,954
And this chart shows a breakdown between the personnel and

176
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:13,762
non personnel. The total budget proposed is 55.7

177
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:17,302
million. Of that, the personal accounts for 45

178
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:20,600
million. Next slide please.

179
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,966
Now we move on to the building inspection fund, which is

180
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:28,780
also the Houston Permitting Center.

181
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,674
The major services is to ensure buildings and structures adhere to

182
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:39,462
City of Houston's Building Code, as well as review and approve commercial

183
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:43,274
and residential development plans for the City's infrastructure.

184
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:47,166
The impact is safety, usability and sustainability of

185
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:50,506
the private and publicly built environment. Next slide,

186
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:51,120
please.

187
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,314
The Building Inspection Fund of revenues are increasing from 84.4

188
00:11:57,352 --> 00:12:01,314
million up to 91.0 million for a 6.7

189
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:04,914
million increase due to more anticipated permitting and

190
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:08,374
construction activity and annual CPI increase in

191
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:12,502
fees. The expenditures are decreasing from 103,000,000

192
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:15,762
to 102.5 million, mainly due to reduction

193
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:19,078
in the fiscal 23 for the design and development of the

194
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:22,586
new permitting and inspection system and decreasing in land and

195
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,846
building costs for joint parking garage with HPD.

196
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:30,090
And this is offset by the increase in personal costs and restricted budgets.

197
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,040
Next slide please.

198
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,278
And this is the program organizational chart for the Building Inspection Fund

199
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:44,734
and for the Office of the Director. We have the Mayor's Office for

200
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:48,146

205
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:07,126
public built environment. Then also the practical application of

206
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:10,866
reviews, permanent permit administration and field inspection

207
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:14,694
for building codes, sign administration and public infrastructure.

208
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:18,554
Then we have Information Technology that provides the highest quality technology

209
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:22,442
based services in the most effective and cost effective manner.

210

Then we have the Management Support Branch, which provides necessary funding

211
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,534
for the Building Inspection biweekly payroll function.

212
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:31,040
Next slide, please.

213
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,826
The total proposed budget is 102.5 million. Of that,

214
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:41,646
personnel accounts for around 70.8 million. The nonpersonal

215
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:45,666
budget is around 31.6 million. 5.4 million is

216
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:49,046

00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:52,514
the HPC support and 4.3 is for HPC,

218
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:56,114
It and supplies and services. Restricted accounts consist

219
00:13:56,162 --> 00:13:59,270
mainly of hits restricted accounts, which is 2.7 million.

220
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,858
Houston Public Works indirect costs of 2.3 million,

221
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:05,866
citywide indirect costs of 1.6 million.

222
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:10,026
Fleet restricted accounts, which is 1 million and payroll restricted accounts of about

223
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:14,106
1 million. Then the building code enforcement of 3.1

224
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:18,062
million is broken down into 1.5 million of consulting services

225
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:22,122
to assist the city in residential and commercial brand review and inspection

226
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:25,970
in citywide developments, with the remaining 2.3 million going towards

227
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,406

00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:04,514
Program. These funds were previously all held in 23

235
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:09,700
ten and were split into three funds in fiscal year 2021.

236
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,566
Pause for just a moment. The presentation appears to have disappeared from the

237
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:15,350
screens.

238
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,422
We have an It issue, as you recognize, so please follow

239

Okay, thanks. 24.

241
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,260
Okay, we're on slide number 24.

242
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,246
The major services provided are to maintain and operate street

243
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,946
and drainage systems, to plan for reinvestment of infrastructure

244
00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:45,962
and growth needs for the City of Houston, and to coordinate with outside entities

245
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:49,882
for impacts to city infrastructure and uses. The impacts affect

246
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:53,966
neighborhood drainage, subregional or drainage, and detention and citywide

247
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:56,770
mobility. Next slide.

248
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,342
This is the overview of the revenues for the transportation and drainage operations.

249
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:06,574
The Stormwater Fund, which is 23 two revenues

250
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:10,854
are decreasing by 3.3 million, and this is due to about 5.8

251
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:14,630
million less transfer needed from the combined utility system to cover

252
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,538
operations and maintenance. And this is offset by an increase in transfer from the

253
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,220
drainage charge from Fund 23 ten by 2 million.

254
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,730
Fund 23 ten. Revenues are increasing by 400,000

255
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,346
due to higher projected amount of interest earned compared to fiscal

256
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:31,440
year 22.

257
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,794
The Advalorum Tax Fund 20 311 revenues

258
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:40,942
are increasing by 2.1 million, mainly due to 1.7 million

259
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:44,286
additional tax revenues projected to transfer in from

260
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:47,954
the General Fund, as well as 400,000 higher projected amount

261
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:51,362
of interest earned compared to fiscal year 2022.

262
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:54,914
The Metro Etol Fund 20 312 is mostly flat,

263
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:58,454
increasing mainly due to 550,000

264
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:02,066
increase in Interfront revenues for potential work performed

265
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:05,186
by transportation and drainage operations for other Houston

266
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:09,562
Public Service Lines or other city departments, as well as 315,000

267
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:13,900
for expected reimbursements under the Metro General Mobility Program.

268
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,900
Next slide, please.

269
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,098
And this is the transportation and drainage expenditures.

270
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:26,446
On the expenditure side, the Stormwater Fund is decreasing by

271
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:29,470
1.5 million due to lower operating costs,

272
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,394
which is about 2,000,002.6 million, restricted budgets of about

273
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:36,770
300,000 and capital rollovers of 600,000.

274
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,354
This is offset by an increase in personnel costs of about

275
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,554
2 million. The Ddsrf Funds group

276
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:47,670
are increasing by 6.2 million due to a 6.9 million

277
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,186
increase in transfers to CIP, which is offset

278
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:54,070
by a 500,000 decrease in supplies.

279
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,886
Keeping in mind that 22 to 23 1020 311

280
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:02,934
20 312 make up the Ddsr Funds group. Next slide.

281
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:04,700
Where are we? There we go.

Next slide please. Slide 31.

339
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,286
It looks like we're back. All right. The total purpose proposed budgets

340
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:56,162
is 390,000,000, of which personal accounts for around

341
00:21:56,216 --> 00:22:01,062
71.6 million and non personal accounts for around 318,000,000.

342
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:05,190
The cash transfer is related to capital projects expenditures account

343
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,758
capital projects expenditures account for a bulk of it and the remaining

344
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:12,262
items are related to operations and maintenance expense for street

345
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:16,166
traffic and drainage related items. Debt services is mostly

346
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:19,790
comprised of retiring the pre 2012 public

347
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,694
Improvement bond debt in 23 two which the principal balance is about

348
00:22:23,732 --> 00:22:25,120
18.8 million.

349
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,840
Next slide please.

350
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,854
Sure. The last part, the debt service is mostly comprised

351
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:38,014
of retiring the pre 2012 public Improvement

352
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:41,778
bond debt in 23 two which the principal balance is

353
00:22:41,784 --> 00:22:45,974
about 18.8 billion. Next slide please. We're on slide 32.

354
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:48,630
Moving on to TranStar. Next slide.

355
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,534
There we go. TranStar is a

356
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:55,842
collaborative program between the city, Harris County,

357
00:22:55,906 --> 00:23:00,070
Metro and the Texas Department of Transportation that provides transportation,

358
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,450
homeland security and emergency management for city

359
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,810
and 13 surrounding counties. Next slide please.

360
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,814
Slide 34. On the revenue side,

361
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:15,066
the decrease is due to the reducing grant contributions

362
00:23:15,098 --> 00:23:20,382
from Metro. Metro reduced contributions by 527,000

363
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:24,046
due to Metro's takeover of the maintenance and upkeep of TranStar

364
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:27,618
Center from GSD. The increase in contribution from the city of

365
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:31,294
Houston and Harris County is about 76,000. On the expenditure

366
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:35,278
side, personnel and land and ground maintenance services are the

367
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:38,818
main drivers for the increase. Then also the increase is also due

368
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,102
to hope, pension, health insurance and land

369
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:46,182
and other ground maintenance costs. Next slide please. Slide number

370
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:48,780
34 five. Excuse me.

371
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,834
The Traffic Operations division which includes about ten

372
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:59,680
FTEs. That manages, operates and maintains a heat and transfer system.

373
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,360
Next slide please.

374
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,754
The proposed budget is 3.4 million of which nonpersonal

375
00:24:07,802 --> 00:24:11,562
accounts for 2 million. The breakout is the operations

376
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:16,402
and maintenance accounts for 1.7 million which consists of 575,000

377
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,906
for construction site work services for about 400,000 for

378
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:22,814
building maintenance, 150,000 for advertising,

379
00:24:22,942 --> 00:24:26,514
about 100,000 for contingency and 400,000 for various

380
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:30,710
other services and supplies. The other remaining 373,000

381
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,274
belong to restricted accounts which includes electricity,

382
00:24:34,402 --> 00:24:37,910
hits and then fleet, payroll and utilities accounts.

383
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,340
Next slide please.

384
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,826
Finally, we move on to

385
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:48,406
the biggest enterprise fund which is the combined utility system, the largest

386
00:24:48,438 --> 00:24:50,320
fund group within Houston Public Works.

387
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,886
The major services for the utility are production and distribution of

388
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:58,750
over 146,000,000,000 gallons of water,

389
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,074
treatment of 90 billion gallons of wastewater and billing and collection for

390
00:25:03,192 --> 00:25:06,690
480,000 water and wastewater accounts.

391
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,500
Next slide please.

392
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,642
The revenue highlights include in fund 8300.

393
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:18,386
They're increasing mainly due to 280,000,000 water and sewer

394
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:21,874
rate increase adopted by council via ordinance

395
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:25,542
2021 five one five fund

396
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:29,238
83 one. There is a 5.7 million decrease in scheduled

397
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:32,954
debt service payments then fund 83 five is

398
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:36,294
the combined utility system savings account and doesn't typically

399
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:40,086
generate revenue. However, in fiscal year 2021

400
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,658
we had a $9.4 million increase due

401
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:47,854
to water authorities contribution for the lease value payment

402
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:50,480
which is about 9.4 or 9.5 million.

403
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,980
Next slide please.

404
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,002
The expenditure highlights include the following for fund 8300,

405
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:03,774
there is an increase of 43.3 million increase in operations

406
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:07,362
and maintenance costs. And this is broken down into various

407
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:10,818
categories which include about 9.5 million in chemicals

408
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:14,486
and gas, 3.3 million management consulting services,

409
00:26:14,668 --> 00:26:17,254
1.1 miscellaneous support services,

410
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:19,820
8.1 million in equipment services,

411
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,442
2.3 million in construction site work services, 4.8 million

412
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:28,090
in river authority contracts, 1.2 million in computer

413
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,154
software, 2.8 million increases in the consent decrease stipulated

414
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:35,982
penalties 4.2 million increase in building maintenance services,

415
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:39,274
2.1 million increase in intrafund electricity

416
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:42,880
maintenance, 1 million Interfront application services,

417
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,970
1.8 million in system debt service transfer,

418
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,166
and 1 million in non capital office expenditures.

419
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,234
There's also a 19 million increase in personnel due to hope and

420
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:56,418
benefits rate changes and a 2.3 decrease in debt

421
00:26:56,434 --> 00:27:00,022
service transfers. For 83,

422
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:04,166
one, there is a 5.8 million in system debt services payment.

423
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:07,542
Then for Fund 83 five, we have

424
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:10,842
an increase in the pay go, which is the pay as you go service,

425
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:14,394
the cash funding for the CIP portion. Then 11.7

426
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:18,038
million increase in capital equipment including new and rollovers,

427
00:27:18,134 --> 00:27:21,774
4.7 million increase for meter replacement program and

428
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:25,354
1.5 million increase for McKinney building maintenance and improvements

429
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:29,306
and 800,000 increase for Water Authority contract debt

430
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:33,054
and then a 4.8 million reduction in transfer to

431
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:36,734
Stormwater. Now, a quick note that we are purposely

432
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:39,986
making the decision to increase our cash funding or the pay

433
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:43,442
go funding for the combined utility system CIP so we can cash

434
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:47,346
on projects instead of debt financing given the current market environment

435
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,950
that has high inflation and also with the rising interest rates.

436
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,920
Next slide, please.

437
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,754
This is the program organizational chart for the Water and Sewer

438
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,566
Operating Fund 8300 office of the Director provides leadership

439
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,990
and oversight in the operations for the Houston Public Works Department.

440
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,206
Houston Water produces and supplies portable drinking

441
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:13,034
water throughout the Harris County and portions of the surrounding counties.

442
00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:17,086
Financial Management manages, monitors and controls department's financial and

443
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:20,254
accounting activities capital projects initiates and

444
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:24,350
manages the sale of surplus utility owned properties. It implements,

445
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,534
installs, configures, supports and maintains Houston

446
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:31,346
Public Works computer software, telecommunications and software such

447
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:35,474
as SCADA, WiMAX, Network and Security Systems management

448
00:28:35,522 --> 00:28:39,474
support Branch provides support in the areas of records management,

449
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:42,806
fleet support and internal review. Now we have

450
00:28:42,828 --> 00:28:46,638
Customer Account Services which reads maintains water sewer

451
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:50,054
meters, produces the bills, receives and processes

452
00:28:50,102 --> 00:28:54,086
invoice payments, manages credit and collections processes and responds

453
00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:57,260
to billing inquiries. Next slide, please.

454
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,302
The combined utility system total proposed budget is 1.6

455
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:05,662
billion for fiscal year 2023, of which

456
00:29:05,716 --> 00:29:09,354
personnel accounts for 234,000,000 and non personnel

457
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:12,666
budget is one point rounded up to 1.4 billion.

458
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:16,062
The nonpersonal section consists of the following

459
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:20,658
$583,000,000 is for debt service 285,000,000

460
00:29:20,744 --> 00:29:24,462
water and wastewater operations, 51 million transfer to

461
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:28,166
Stormwater and 300 million for the pay as you

462
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:32,306
go for the cash funding for the CIP. Next slide,

463
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:32,920
please.

464
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,622
Then this is the combined utility system revenues,

465
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:45,146
expenditures, and this sort of gives you a net overview. And if

466
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:48,918
you please note that in fiscal year 22 and fiscal year 23,

467
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:52,474
the combined utility system is showing a budgetary deficit,

468
00:29:52,602 --> 00:29:56,558
which the combined utility system is intentionally spending down its

469
00:29:56,644 --> 00:30:00,266
fund balance. Next slide,

470
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,662
please. That concludes the

471
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:06,738
Houston Public Works Budget presentation. We're open to any questions.

472
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:09,826
Thank you very much. We have a number of council members in queue. And first

473
00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:13,650
of all, thank you for skinnying this down. When I saw

474
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,150
20 public speakers, I knew we had to do a little bit of an audible.

475
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,910
So thank you, directors. Appreciate that. Council Member Michael Kubosh.

476
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,578
Thank you very much. I noticed on page 40 you talked about that's the

477
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:28,262
first time I heard the word consent decree. Have we had any breaches

478
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,890
of the consent decree?

479
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,290
Would you mind repeating the question? The wastewater.

480
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:40,270
Have we had any breaches since we've actually signed the consent decree?

481
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,746
So we have continued to have some sanitary sewer overflows

482
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:49,200
that. Part of signing the consent decree is an

483
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,454
agreed plan to invest and reduce those over

484
00:30:53,492 --> 00:30:56,718
time. There's a recognition when you sign the consent decree that it's

485
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:59,746
not going to magically stop. So we have continued to

486
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:03,982
have some, but we are doing better. We are seeing significant

487
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:07,830
reductions with the increased cleaning and televising that is already

488
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,906
happening. Let me ask you concerning the defect. I get reports

489
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:15,974
of defective water meters. One of the biggest complaints I get is the fact

490
00:31:16,012 --> 00:31:19,366
that we have water bills, that citizens

491
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:22,250
are trying to contest their water bills.

492
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,826
Have we determined what percentage of the

493
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:30,666
water meters are defective and what the citizens

494
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:33,838
do? So let me jump in real quick.

495
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:38,110
It is very rare for an actual water meter to be defective.

496
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,586
What we are seeing is the remote reader that attaches

497
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:47,134
to the water meter. They are 20 years old and they are dying

498
00:31:47,182 --> 00:31:50,706
every day. And so what happens is, we have months where we

499
00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:54,338
estimate, because we didn't get a good read, but the meters themselves,

500
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:57,606
it's very rare for one to be defective. Ways to test them.

501
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:01,334
Well, if the device that's attached to it, that's reading it is

502
00:32:01,372 --> 00:32:05,062
defective, are getting old, then the citizen would consider

503
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:08,618
that a defective water meter because they see it as

504
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,860
all encapsulated. As one thing.

505
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,130
How do we buy fuel, gasoline,

506
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,414
gasoline, and diesel and CNG?

507
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:23,242
Do we purchase it in an annual basis,

508
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:26,602
or do we have contracts? How do we get our fuel?

509
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:30,622
So I'm going to defer that to fleet, as that is not public

510
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:33,910
works purchasing separately. It is a citywide contract.

511
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,710
Thank you very much. Put me back in the queue, sir. Council Member

512
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,026
Vice Chair Ed Pollard. Thank you,

513
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:43,570
Chair, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for the presentation.

514
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,974
My questions are regarding permitting from

515
00:32:48,012 --> 00:32:51,414
a financial standpoint. What are some processes or

516
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:55,142
systems that we can put in place or that we have put in place

517
00:32:55,276 --> 00:32:59,238
to streamline expedite, speed up the permitting

518
00:32:59,334 --> 00:33:03,270
process. So we recently gave a presentation

519
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,726
to TTI about some of the improvements and processes

520
00:33:06,758 --> 00:33:10,558
that are happening internally. Some of the biggest things that we've done

521
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:14,606
is provide an opportunity for the same reviewer to review the

522
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:18,346
plan set on a subsequent submittal. But we've

523
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:21,954
also augmented our capacity by

524
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:25,742
executing outside contracts that allow us, when our capacity

525
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:29,170
exceeds our personnel resources, to use some of those outside

526
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,834
resources. We're still working to

527
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:36,146
catch up and get on top of it. We admit that we are longer than

528
00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:39,718
we need to be, but we do believe that we have the tools in

529
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:43,206
place to eat down the backlog and keep up moving forward. So when

530
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:46,246
you say that, you know that we're kind of behind, but we're doing what we

531
00:33:46,268 --> 00:33:50,534
can to catch up, are there benchmarks

532
00:33:50,582 --> 00:33:53,706
in place or a strategy in place

533
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:57,478
to show that, okay, we know we need to get here, here's how we're

534
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,778
going to do it. So yes, sir. And that's

535
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:04,766
part of what was presented at TTI just recently. I would be happy

536
00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:07,550
it is available on the website. I'm council member.

537
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,258
We'll provide that information, but we'll be happy to provide you some

538
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:16,660
additional information on that. Okay? And can we jump to page 25 really quick,

539
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,946
Director? It might be good to get a date of that meeting if your staff

540
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:27,910
is able to help us with that for the Council member.

541
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,320
Everybody doesn't watch those.

542
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,082
Yes, sir. Page 25. Page 20.

543
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:40,826
Go ahead. Page 25. If we can pull it up

544
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:45,322
on the screen. There was a for

545
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,646
stormwater. We're showing a 4.8%

546
00:34:49,748 --> 00:34:53,546
decrease change from variance from fiscal

547
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:57,360
year 22 to now. Can you further elaborate on that?

548
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,106
Trying to find where you're looking at the 4.8 million. I'm seeing a 5.8

549
00:35:05,128 --> 00:35:08,622
million less transfer. I see the stormwater revenues,

550
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:12,158
is that what you're talking about? Not the top line. Right. So the, the revenues

551
00:35:12,174 --> 00:35:15,574
are decreasing by 3.3 million. This is due to $5.8

552
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:19,830
million less transfer needed from the combined utility system

553
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,750
to cover operations and maintenance cost. That's what it's due to.

554
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,854
And it's offset by an increase in

555
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:30,054
transfer from 23 ten. So stormwater gets its funding from two

556
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:33,610
areas. One is Ddsr of 23 ten, and the bulk of

557
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,906
the funding comes from the combined utility system. And so this year there was

558
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:40,394
a lesser need and then a little bit of an increase funding from

559
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:43,822
the Ddsrf funds group. So it nets out to about a

560
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:47,566
3.3 million decrease in the funding that was needed for Saltwater. But there is

561
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:49,550
adequate funding for it, in your opinion?

562
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,380
Yes, adequate funding. Absolutely. Thank you.

563
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:59,074
Before we go to council member Sally Alcorn, we've been joined by

564
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:02,046
council members Amy Peck, Tarsha Jackson,

565
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:06,114
Mary Anne Huffman, vice Mayor Pro TEM Martha Castex Tatum

566
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:09,750
and Chairman David Robinson. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

567
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,898
Thank you, Chair, and thank you for your presentation. In the Ddsrf

568
00:36:14,994 --> 00:36:19,078
drainage fee revenue, I noticed that we

569
00:36:19,164 --> 00:36:22,522
budgeted last year like $113,000,000

570
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:25,914
in revenue. We ended up getting more than that, about 126 or

571
00:36:25,952 --> 00:36:29,274
28 million, and then we're budgeting back down at 113.

572
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:32,606
Is there a reason that we had that increase last year and over what

573
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:35,440
we thought? And why aren't we expecting it? Again,

574
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:46,106
some of these revenues, it depends on projections,

575
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:50,286
and again, we look at it from a fund perspective. So you're budgeting more conservatively

576
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:53,246
on revenues. That's what we try to do. Just we don't want to overestimate.

577
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:55,822
Okay, thank you. And in the Ddsrf,

578
00:36:55,886 --> 00:36:59,126
advalorum transferred from

579
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:03,270
the general fund was about 77 million, plan about 77 million.

580
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,810
We're advancing about 97 million to capital projects.

581
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,574
I'm assuming some of that's coming from from fund balance. From from fund balance,

582
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:15,514
yes. When we get the transfer from the general fund to that

583
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:19,130
fund, that is less what's paid down in debt service.

584
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,958
That's done before you get the transfer? That's correct. That is debt service prior to

585
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:26,702
do you know how much debt has been paid down from

586
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:30,382
Advalorum since Rebuild Houston started? The amount

587
00:37:30,436 --> 00:37:33,826
of debt that we paid off so far has been about and let me have

588
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:35,220
that information here.

589
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:44,290
Let me bring that's

590
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,222
1.5 billion that's been paid, and we have about 905,000,000.

591
00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:52,806
That's $1.5 billion in debt. And that is

592
00:37:52,828 --> 00:37:56,786
a major thing because that's what let us borrow for pension

593
00:37:56,818 --> 00:38:00,522
obligation bonds. I mean, that the reduction in debt was a big part

594
00:38:00,576 --> 00:38:04,106
in letting us borrow more money. So that's an important feature on

595
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:07,974
the building Inspection fund. And that presentation was done in November

596
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:10,730
4 of last year on permitting.

597
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:14,826
So we're due for an update, and Council Member Robinson and I will be hosting

598
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:18,730
an event on permitting. And put me back in the queue.

599
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,420
Council Member Michael Kubash. Thank you very much.

600
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:28,114
Once again, the number of complaints that I

601
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:32,034
receive each week deal with either water

602
00:38:32,152 --> 00:38:36,422
problems, either leaks, or the customer

603
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:39,718
feels overbuilt, and the other is

604
00:38:39,804 --> 00:38:42,550
permitting. Permitting.

605
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,574
The citizens just shouldn't have to hire

606
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:51,146
an expediter to get a permit done.

607
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:55,174
And I don't know what your role

608
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:58,966
is on trying to get this permitting done properly,

609
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:03,450
but I know that we passed, during the Parker administration,

610
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,786
right before she left, we passed an ordinance that allowed

611
00:39:07,818 --> 00:39:10,400
the permit fees to go into a separate fund.

612
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:15,010
Is that still happening? So the permitting

613
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,734
fund that we briefed today is a special revenue

614
00:39:18,782 --> 00:39:22,274
fund within the general fund that was created during that time. So it is

615
00:39:22,312 --> 00:39:25,826
a subset of the general fund, but it

616
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:29,490
is somewhat firewalled off in the sense that the fees

617
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,554
generated by permit fees stay in that fund and are used for the expenses

618
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:37,046
in that fund. Well, the whole purpose for permitting is for public safety

619
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:40,554
and not for necessarily revenue gathering. But I

620
00:39:40,592 --> 00:39:44,026
do want to say that we

621
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,580
definitely need some help there. How much money

622
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,418
did the Public Works apply for ARPA funds

623
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:54,990
or cares dollars from the federal government on COVID-19?

624
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,634
Separate that is, separate from this budget hearing,

625
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:04,050
and we're happy to provide that to you separately and offline.

626
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,666
We worked with the citywide processes for both ARPA and

627
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:11,234
COVID and within the city's priorities. We did

628
00:40:11,272 --> 00:40:14,846
receive funding in both of those categories to support activities within

629
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:18,658
the department, but that is not included

630
00:40:18,674 --> 00:40:22,454
in this presentation as we were directed. Well, I would sure like to have that

631
00:40:22,572 --> 00:40:26,134
sent to me. Would you do that? Yes.

632
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:30,326
No, absolutely, yes. I mean, the City of Houston received

633
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:34,010
ARPA funds and it was subdivided into each and every

634
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,420
department within the city. I'm not sure what your allocation is that correct?

635
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,120
Yes, that is correct. Thank you,

636
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,286
Council Member Tiffany Thomas. Thank you,

637
00:40:46,308 --> 00:40:49,806
Mayor Pro. Tim, you went through the presentation fairly quickly, so can

638
00:40:49,828 --> 00:40:53,166
you clarify some points to me and just give me context for the divisions

639
00:40:53,198 --> 00:40:56,606
that have a substantial budget but zero FTE?

640
00:40:56,718 --> 00:41:00,900
So, for example, if we go to page 27

641
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,378
stormwater Fund, the Management Support Branch,

642
00:41:05,554 --> 00:41:09,922
it's 296,000,000, but there's zero FTE.

643
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:14,280
Can you just clarify why

644
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,446
it's a chargeback? Yes, I believe that's a citywide

645
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:22,060
chargeback that comes back to us that we pay.

646
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:27,146
And is that the same train of thought for all divisions that

647
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:30,426
might have substantial budget, certain C TOI processes that

648
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:33,680
we pay for that get charged back to us? Got it. Thank you much.

649
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,206
Follow up by Council Member Michael Kubosh. Can you

650
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:41,498
tell us where the city of Houston rates

651
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:45,246
in major cities as far as our water cost that we're charging

652
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:48,994
our citizens? Have you done a comparison with other cities like

653
00:41:49,032 --> 00:41:52,382
Dallas or Fort Worth or the major Texas cities?

654
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:56,686
Yes, sir. Last year when we went through the rate study and recommended

655
00:41:56,718 --> 00:42:00,726
updates to City Council, we had several charts that were direct comparisons with

656
00:42:00,748 --> 00:42:03,750
other cities. We were at the bottom of the pile, and now we're still towards

657
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,558
the bottom of the pile. I'm glad to hear that. Thank you very much for

658
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:10,058
that. I think the citizens need to be aware of that because when they get

659
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:13,258
their water bills, I'm sure they don't feel that way. And the bottom of the

660
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:17,066
pile being good, as in we're cheaper. Thank you

661
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:20,042
very much. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

662
00:42:20,186 --> 00:42:23,886
Thank you. Back on the building Inspection fund. And I know that

663
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:28,046
there are 26 additional FDES coming to

664
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:31,134
the permitting center over last year.

665
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:34,938
And that's good because in looking at

666
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:38,594
the performance measures, we're at 22% of first

667
00:42:38,632 --> 00:42:42,126
reviews for commercial plans in 15 days, but our goal

668
00:42:42,158 --> 00:42:45,298
is to get to 80%. So that's a pretty significant thing. I know we've

669
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:49,634
done some outsourcing. I know we've got some we have not done any outsourcing.

670
00:42:49,682 --> 00:42:53,366
Not outsourcing. Sorry. Staff augmentation. Very clear about

671
00:42:53,388 --> 00:42:57,318
that. Staff augmentation and

672
00:42:57,404 --> 00:43:01,334
then hiring. And I'll ask these in writing.

673
00:43:01,382 --> 00:43:05,334
I'd like to know specifically. I've got some charts there where the Vacancies

674
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,970
and make sure we're getting those 26 people to the right

675
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,718
places. Primarily, the complaints I hear about on

676
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:15,866
slow downs are in the office of City Engineer,

677
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:20,154
so traffic and Storm and to some degree, planning. So that's

678
00:43:20,202 --> 00:43:23,978
where I'd want to see those resources spent.

679
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:27,986
But I'll have some additional questions in writing, but just wanted to get

680
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:30,786
that out there that I was happy to see that there were 26. I think

681
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,730
that we have had attrition of over 30 people.

682
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,454
So 26 hopefully brings us back to address the backlog

683
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:40,966
and go to the future. Thank you. Yes. And make sure we upload those to

684
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:44,246
SharePoint, as you always. So thank you. Just a quick follow up to

685
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:47,570
Council Member Kubasha's. Questions related to permitting.

686
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,418
A few months ago, we did a supplement to hire we hired a

687
00:43:51,424 --> 00:43:53,930
firm to supplement the existing employees.

688
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:58,122
Does that $89 million I'm looking on the expense side include that,

689
00:43:58,176 --> 00:44:02,014
or is that separate? So it is in the

690
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:05,546
non personnel side of the expenses. So it's not included

691
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:08,430
in the 89 million I was looking at in the previous page.

692
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,794
Correct. I think I answered my own question.

693
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:15,406
It's not included. It's a supplement. You also mentioned consent

694
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:18,914
decree, stipulated penalties. How much do we pay in

695
00:44:18,952 --> 00:44:21,490
stipulated penalties on consent decree?

696
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:26,010
So the first demand that we had, and I'd be recalling this from memory,

697
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:29,560
was for 1.2 million. 1.3 million.

698
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,360
And that was for a full year's worth.

699
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,966
We had budgeted about two and a half million when we originally laid this out.

700
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:40,474
And we're performing better and have lower estimates than that.

701
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:43,706
So less than 2 million a year. And it will continue to go

702
00:44:43,728 --> 00:44:47,034
down, although the way that the agreement is

703
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:50,250
written, the stipulated penalties are a lot lower.

704
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,886
Now. When you get to year five and year eight and year ten,

705
00:44:53,988 --> 00:44:57,760
they go up because that's the incentive for you to get the work done.

706
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:01,950
Got it. So we better get moving. Yes. So on

707
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,710
page slide 40, you had on

708
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,206
C US, 256,000,000 billion dollar

709
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:13,570
million dollar increase on the variance to the budget

710
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:18,898
you mentioned. It's pay as you go. Water Authority contract Debt

711
00:45:19,074 --> 00:45:22,962
Is that the Northeast water purification percentage

712
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:25,560
debt in our percentage of payment,

713
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,014
83 five. What is the increase?

714
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:34,746
You said pay go water is a

715
00:45:34,768 --> 00:45:38,282
significant portion of it. Previously, we'd done about

716
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:41,766
$70 million in Pego, but given the current environment,

717
00:45:41,798 --> 00:45:45,158
with the market conditions, we increased that to 300 million. So it's

718
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:48,526
an additional about 230,000,000. That's a significant portion. But I think what

719
00:45:48,548 --> 00:45:52,094
you're talking about is 800,000, which is a very small amount.

720
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:55,406
That's increase for Water Authority contractual debt

721
00:45:55,438 --> 00:45:59,122
that previously existed. What bucket do we pay

722
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:02,814
the Northeast water? Our share of the Northeast water purification plant.

723
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:06,146
It's part of the total debt services that I had mentioned previously and included

724
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:10,066
in the $583,000,000 on an annual basis. Council member

725
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:11,350
Tasha Jackson.

726
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,502
Thank you. Thank you, Director Haddock, for the presentation.

727
00:46:18,646 --> 00:46:22,106
I have one question about the transportation and

728
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:25,546
drainage operation budget. Does that in any of

729
00:46:25,568 --> 00:46:29,918
that include like a drainage maintenance plan

730
00:46:30,084 --> 00:46:33,150
for neighborhoods that have the open ditches?

731
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,874
Yes, the operation side of that does include the maintenance

732
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:40,922
of the roadside ditches as part of the activities

733
00:46:40,986 --> 00:46:44,122
within that fund. Okay. Because right now, I know the residents are

734
00:46:44,196 --> 00:46:48,018
like the ditches that's within their neighborhoods. They are required to

735
00:46:48,184 --> 00:46:52,306
maintenance their own drainages and their ditches. And so one

736
00:46:52,328 --> 00:46:57,006
of the things we're trying to push is to get Public Works to conduct

737
00:46:57,038 --> 00:47:01,026
that maintenance because that contributes a lot of the flooding in these neighborhoods.

738
00:47:01,058 --> 00:47:05,126
And so I just wanted to know, was that included? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Thank you,

739
00:47:05,308 --> 00:47:07,660
staff from Council member Abby Cayman's office.

740
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,802
Good morning, everyone. Council Member Cayman first wants to thank Public

741
00:47:13,856 --> 00:47:17,082
Works and the entire team and the Director, of course,

742
00:47:17,136 --> 00:47:20,666
for your leadership and all the work that you guys are doing day

743
00:47:20,688 --> 00:47:24,894
in and day out. There are too many people to think individually right now,

744
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:28,202
but we recognize not only the budgetary challenges,

745
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:31,950
but the additional challenge that COVID presented. I know you didn't

746
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,142
go through them, but the list is in the appendix

747
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:40,270
should be commended. We have a few questions that we will also share and submit

748
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:45,106
through the SharePoint. But she noticed some divisions

749
00:47:45,138 --> 00:47:48,706
in Red, and that Council

750
00:47:48,738 --> 00:47:52,198
Member came in, has passed on a budget amendment last year

751
00:47:52,284 --> 00:47:55,970
that will possibly help inspections and bring in additional revenue.

752
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,706
Flagging that to see where in the process that is.

753
00:47:59,808 --> 00:48:03,430
Again, we will communicate that question via SharePoint.

754
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:07,238
The question that Council Member Cayman is asking of each department is due

755
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:10,990
to the budgetary constraints, including the revenue cap, what needs

756
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,670
exist that we are not able to address through this year's budget?

757
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:19,806
That's a big question. So within the activities that we

758
00:48:19,828 --> 00:48:22,906
have defined for us, we believe that we have adequate funding

759
00:48:22,938 --> 00:48:25,966
to address if we want to add activities citywide,

760
00:48:25,998 --> 00:48:29,198
that's where we begin to run into challenges. I know there's some requests

761
00:48:29,294 --> 00:48:32,900
for additional maintenance in some areas that we see,

762
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:37,426
particularly in the storm drainage system. We also see it in our sidewalks.

763
00:48:37,618 --> 00:48:41,030
And so our challenges would be those. But I would

764
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,966
also remind everybody that in street and drainage, in our transportation and

765
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:49,082
drainage operations, we are limited to 25%

766
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:52,454
that can be spent on O and M by Ddsrf,

767
00:48:52,502 --> 00:48:53,850
by the charter amendment.

768
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:00,786
And we are at that 25% with the activities

769
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:05,470
we have. So additional funding wouldn't necessarily even be available for those activities.

770
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:09,534
Council member Tiffany Thomas. Thank you. Just to follow up

771
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:13,114
on that, can you share more about the capital improvement projects

772
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:16,734
that have been scheduled but not funded? Because I know we have significant

773
00:49:16,782 --> 00:49:20,126
number of capital improvements that are due to neighborhoods.

774
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:23,506
So in context of having adequate funding, but also the

775
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:27,094
caveat of that 25%. Could you elaborate on that?

776
00:49:27,212 --> 00:49:30,902
Well, so the capital improvements are not with that 25%

777
00:49:30,956 --> 00:49:34,310
cap. And so the funding that we have available,

778
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,026
we've seen a significant increase in the estimated cost of

779
00:49:38,048 --> 00:49:41,580
those projects. And so everybody's still in line.

780
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:46,022
It takes longer to serve the line. And so because of the increased

781
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:49,866
cost, in some cases, the decreased funding we have seen because

782
00:49:49,888 --> 00:49:53,766
of revenue cap less transfer than we had originally projected

783
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:57,198
on the advilorum side, and that's really what has extended out.

784
00:49:57,284 --> 00:50:01,562
We've also seen a decrease in metro sales tax revenue

785
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:05,346
that has been transferred as well. So it

786
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:08,386
is really a struggle. But we have those

787
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:12,098
projects developed enough to seek the federal funding that

788
00:50:12,264 --> 00:50:15,530
should become available through the infrastructure bill and the IJA.

789
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:19,302
So we are actively matching projects to

790
00:50:19,356 --> 00:50:22,854
programs as we see the buckets become available to

791
00:50:22,892 --> 00:50:26,150
move those forward, with a big emphasis on looking

792
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,622
for funding those capital projects in our communities

793
00:50:29,686 --> 00:50:32,570
that have historically been underinvested.

794
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,426
And there's no way to skip the line. I'm just asking, can we skip the

795
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:37,580
line? No.

796
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:44,918
Last question from council members is Council Member David Robinson. Thank you,

797
00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:47,958
Chair and Director. Thanks for your presentation. I know you've covered a

798
00:50:47,964 --> 00:50:51,794
lot of territory and picking up a little bit where my colleague Tiffany Thomas

799
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:55,178
just went with Deferred CIP projects and

800
00:50:55,264 --> 00:50:58,806
some of what our chair has inquired about with the biggest ticket

801
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:02,966
items on water and sewer and the general purpose combined

802
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:06,782
utility programs. I wanted to get some

803
00:51:06,836 --> 00:51:10,800
territory on the real bottom of that. I know you and I have talked about

804
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,994
the expenditures going to the accessibility program that Director

805
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:19,554
Casares has taken on, as well as some of what you've described today

806
00:51:19,592 --> 00:51:23,314
with TranStar and other programs. So from

807
00:51:23,352 --> 00:51:27,058
the large budget items to the small, I wonder if you

808
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:30,946
could just take a second to narrate some of your concerns about the

809
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:34,262
changes in the budget this year, what we might be looking at,

810
00:51:34,316 --> 00:51:37,190
and anything that we can help you with.

811
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,078
I don't know that I would use concerns. I would say that we definitely have

812
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:45,240
some opportunities to look back at our activities and make sure that

813
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:49,494
everything that we're putting our energy effort resources to is the highest priority

814
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:52,954
for the city. And so as we look at our biggest ones,

815
00:51:52,992 --> 00:51:56,794
our water and wastewater, obviously we're going to be focused on the resilience

816
00:51:56,842 --> 00:52:00,590
and sustainability of the existing systems while

817
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,790
also allowing for that future growth and redevelopment.

818
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,674
And if you bring that through water wastewater, that also includes

819
00:52:07,722 --> 00:52:11,106
street and storm. But on the permitting side, this will be

820
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:15,042
the year that we really focus on moving towards the

821
00:52:15,096 --> 00:52:18,402
2021 building codes. And so we're going to be really

822
00:52:18,456 --> 00:52:21,846
focused on that forward leaning. What can we do to

823
00:52:21,868 --> 00:52:26,114
make sure that we are setting things in place that administrations

824
00:52:26,162 --> 00:52:29,634
after this one where I'm sitting,

825
00:52:29,762 --> 00:52:33,286
are primed for the future? Yes, and as

826
00:52:33,308 --> 00:52:36,118
you and I have spoken about with that on the queue of things that we're

827
00:52:36,134 --> 00:52:40,154
going to take on, whether that's within a special called meeting in the

828
00:52:40,192 --> 00:52:43,306
June meeting of the TTI committee or as soon as we can

829
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:46,766
get to it after July 1,

830
00:52:46,948 --> 00:52:50,746
we're going to take that on pending the administration's approval.

831
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:53,630
So thank you very much, Director. Thank you, Chair.

832
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:58,238
We'll now move to the public comment section. There are six

833
00:52:58,324 --> 00:53:01,780
virtual public speakers and we have a total of

834
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,362
20 public speakers on the list.

835
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:09,378
Please, when I announce your name, please hit star six to unmute because we

836
00:53:09,384 --> 00:53:13,090
will have to go rapidly. Our first speaker is Mr. Doug Smith.

837
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,530
1 minute. Each speaker has 1 minute.

838
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,050
Doug Smith.

839
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,750
Mr. Tom Thompson. Star Six. Mr.

840
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,710
Thompson?

841
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,950
Yes. Can you hear me? Is this Mr.

842
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,300
Thompson? That's Doug. Yes, go ahead.

843
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:55,410
Who do we have? Do we have Tom Thompson?

844
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,126
And this is Doug Smith as well. Do we

845
00:54:00,168 --> 00:54:01,590
have Mr. Thompson?

846
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,880
Yes, go ahead. Do you hear me? Yes, sir, we can.

847
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,680
Okay, thank you.

848
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:14,380
Do you want Doug to go first? Yes, please.

849
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,810
Mr. Thompson, we're waiting.

850
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:30,286
My comments very brief. I just want to say I

851
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:34,254
am encouraged to see the increase in funding proposed for

852
00:54:34,292 --> 00:54:38,690
street maintenance in the transportation and drainage operations budget,

853
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,826
but strong alert to the city to allocate sufficient funding to

854
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:47,170
ensure that our bike lanes are regularly cleaned and maintained,

855
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:51,090
ensuring that this critical transportation

856
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:55,206
in which the city and its partners have already made and committed a

857
00:54:55,228 --> 00:54:58,502
significant investment, can continue to be used,

858
00:54:58,636 --> 00:55:03,014
thereby increasing safety and accessibility for all transportation

859
00:55:03,062 --> 00:55:06,474
modes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Thompson. Go ahead,

860
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:09,722
Mr. Smith. Good morning.

861
00:55:09,856 --> 00:55:14,090
I have two quick comments. First of all, congratulations to the Department.

862
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:18,286
If you look at page 958 of the report,

863
00:55:18,468 --> 00:55:22,202
their performance statistics with the Metro funds is fantastic.

864
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:25,898
It's the best of any department that I've seen, and they deserve

865
00:55:25,914 --> 00:55:29,906
credit for that. And I'd like to ask one question. We provide

866
00:55:30,008 --> 00:55:33,422
water to entities outside the city. This is a valuable

867
00:55:33,486 --> 00:55:37,134
commodity and getting more valuable every day. Can we charge

868
00:55:37,182 --> 00:55:40,466
premium rates to those users to recognize

869
00:55:40,498 --> 00:55:44,470
that value and give Houston citizens a break in their bills?

870
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,582
Unfortunately, I've asked that question many times, and the answer to that is

871
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,560
no, we cannot. Why?

872
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,740
We're required by state.

873
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,500
Okay, that answers it. Thank you.

874
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,540
Next speaker is Mr. That's all,

875
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,010
Joseph. Katufro.

876
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:11,086
Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Yes, sir. Thank you. Sorry for butchering your

877
00:56:11,108 --> 00:56:14,942
name. It's all right. Happens every day.

878
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:18,506
Good morning. My name is Joe Kutrufo, and I'm the Executive Director of Bike Houston,

879
00:56:18,538 --> 00:56:21,906
a nonprofit organization working to transform Houston into a

880
00:56:21,928 --> 00:56:25,666
city where anyone can get around safely and easily by

881
00:56:25,688 --> 00:56:28,978
bike. Like Mr. Thompson, I'm here to express support

882
00:56:29,144 --> 00:56:32,926
for the Houston Bikeways Maintenance program. Houston's bike

883
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:37,046
network is critical transportation infrastructure and it's time to start maintaining it

884
00:56:37,068 --> 00:56:40,374
as such. And it's no secret to anyone, including some people in this

885
00:56:40,412 --> 00:56:45,986
room who ride bikes around our city that are protected by leaves,

886
00:56:46,018 --> 00:56:49,450
litter, broken glass. I even came across the aftermath of

887
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,886
car crash and found the whole front end of a Honda in the bike lane

888
00:56:52,918 --> 00:56:56,346
one time. This is the number one complaint that Bike Houston hears about

889
00:56:56,368 --> 00:56:59,646
from people who ride bikes and in fact, some folks in this

890
00:56:59,668 --> 00:57:03,466
room. Council members Alcorn Robinson, we saw the debris piling

891
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:06,714
up in the WA and Commonwealth bike lanes. Council member Pollard,

892
00:57:06,762 --> 00:57:10,202
you may remember the garbage we saw in the new bike lanes on Hillcroft.

893
00:57:10,266 --> 00:57:13,646
Council member Cesneros knows all too well about the debris in the bike lanes

894
00:57:13,678 --> 00:57:17,218
on Hardy Street. And Council member Kubosh could spend a lot less on repairs at

895
00:57:17,224 --> 00:57:20,078
Blue Line Bike Lab if our bikeways were better maintained.

896
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:23,566
And nobody likes a flat tire, of course. But when we fail to clear debris

897
00:57:23,598 --> 00:57:26,726
out of our bikeways, we create a safety hazard too. Because when

898
00:57:26,748 --> 00:57:30,146
the lanes are full of debris, people opt to ride outside of the bike lanes,

899
00:57:30,178 --> 00:57:33,894
entirely defeating the purpose of the bike lanes. We've invested so much

900
00:57:33,932 --> 00:57:37,838
in building Houston's amazing bike network. And we're going to celebrate these investments

901
00:57:37,874 --> 00:57:41,066
on Friday at the City's Bike to Work Day. But we can't stop at

902
00:57:41,088 --> 00:57:45,066
just building the lanes. We have to do the fiscally responsible thing and maintain them

903
00:57:45,088 --> 00:57:48,826
too. Our bike network. Mr. Katrufo, I'll let you go

904
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:52,670
longer than a minute. Can you wrap it up in 5 seconds? I do.

905
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:56,254
Friday. We have to make sure it's useful and safe. And if we're serious about

906
00:57:56,292 --> 00:57:59,854
being a multimodal city where people have real transportation options other

907
00:57:59,892 --> 00:58:03,042
than driving, we need to make sure the bike lanes are useful and

908
00:58:03,096 --> 00:58:05,970
safe. Thank you. Thank you very much. Mr. Kurtrufo.

909
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:10,706
Just to make sure we don't have Jason Oliver, Aris Brown or Vicky

910
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:12,470
Martin on virtually.

911
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,642
And you are? Okay. Jason,

912
00:58:18,706 --> 00:58:22,626
come on. We'll go through the list. Next we

913
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:26,394
have Saba Blanding no,

914
00:58:26,512 --> 00:58:30,074
we'll call you in a minute. Yes,

915
00:58:30,112 --> 00:58:33,066
sir. 1 minute. Just a reminder. Got it? Yes, sir.

916
00:58:33,168 --> 00:58:35,840
Hi. I'm Jason Oliver. I live in District G.

917
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,398
Few questions I'm interested in. Oh perfect.

918
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:42,000
That's helpful. Thank you.

919
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,400
So I was tall too, so this works. Well,

920
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,994
I see that you all completed 74 council district service from

921
00:58:53,032 --> 00:58:56,226
projects, which is great. People often mention how long it

922
00:58:56,248 --> 00:59:00,066
takes to implement CDSF projects. I'm interested in what can

923
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:03,958
we do to speed up the implementation. Kind of going along with what

924
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:07,766
Council member Thomas said. And I'm also interested on page 29,

925
00:59:07,868 --> 00:59:11,814
if you can explain how much is being transferred through

926
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:15,974
these 380 agreements specifically and then to which entities

927
00:59:16,102 --> 00:59:19,654
are receiving those which entities are receiving those funds.

928
00:59:19,782 --> 00:59:20,700
Thank you.

929
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:27,520
Hold on 1 second.

930
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:36,654
Any comments to

931
00:59:36,692 --> 00:59:40,290
answer the previous question for a 380 agreement is about 4.1 million.

932
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,500
4.1. Yes. Okay, thank you.

933
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,514
Debt service. Correct.

934
00:59:48,712 --> 00:59:49,700
Got it.

935
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:55,320
You are Saba Blanding? Yes. Okay.

936
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:00,646
Hi, I'm saba Blanding District I i had two questions

937
01:00:00,828 --> 01:00:04,770
over the past seven years. I noticed that your department has seen fluctuations in

938
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,650
your budget for year to year, increasing as much as 9.8%

939
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,994
and decreasing as much as 19%. How have

940
01:00:12,032 --> 01:00:15,270
these annual fluctuations impacted your department's ability

941
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,878
to plan for and provide adequate services to meet the needs of

942
01:00:18,884 --> 01:00:22,906
the city of Houston? I thought it was really interesting how much it fluctuated.

943
01:00:23,098 --> 01:00:26,794
And secondly, on slide 14, you said that more infrastructure

944
01:00:26,842 --> 01:00:30,766
is degrading due to deferred, maintenance and insufficient

945
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:34,354
reinvestment. What type of investment do you need to see

946
01:00:34,392 --> 01:00:38,206
from the city of Houston in order for your department to address Houston's

947
01:00:38,238 --> 01:00:40,450
infrastructure needs in a timely manner?

948
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,460
So fluctuation in budget and then the second part

949
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:51,916
yeah, it just goes back to so some

950
01:00:51,938 --> 01:00:55,432
of this fluctuation in budget over previous years has actually been rollover

951
01:00:55,496 --> 01:00:59,404
of capital equipment. Our vehicles are replacing our dump trucks.

952
01:00:59,452 --> 01:01:03,660
Very large expenditures that transfer from year to year in the operations budget.

953
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,584
On the capital investment side, what we're seeing is actually the result of

954
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:11,344
decades of underinvestment that we can't

955
01:01:11,392 --> 01:01:14,884
maintain to keep it in useful life when something's 50, 60, 70 years

956
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:18,564
old. And so that statement is really referring to the fact that we

957
01:01:18,602 --> 01:01:22,516
have increased build. Use of forward is increasing the reinvestment

958
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:26,616
and reconstruction. But there are things that are because every year

959
01:01:26,638 --> 01:01:30,520
we go along, things are continuing to age that continue to get

960
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:34,076
beyond that. The water and wastewater system, the water rate study that we did

961
01:01:34,098 --> 01:01:37,276
last year will have a significant reinvestment in the water and

962
01:01:37,298 --> 01:01:40,620
wastewater system as a result of those rates.

963
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,020
Thank you. Diane Crest.

964
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,640
Diane Cress.

965
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,816
Doug, turn your camera off. We love you, but we don't love you

966
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:58,500
that much. Diane Cress.

967
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,020
Diane Cress.

968
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,000
Brown. Doris Brown.

969
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,370
Okay, keep going.

970
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,580
Becky Seal. I'm sorry. You, miss Brown.

971
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,464
My apologies. Come on forward. We'll have Ms.

972
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:30,780
Doris Brown followed missed by Miss Becky Seal.

973
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:48,974
My name is Doris Brown, and I'd like to address the historic

974
01:02:49,022 --> 01:02:52,290
disinvestment in our bipartisan neighborhoods.

975
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,120
For years,

976
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:59,202
we have lived with the threat of flooding.

977
01:02:59,266 --> 01:03:02,406
It has come to the point to where we are anxious when it start to

978
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:03,190
rain.

979
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:09,658
Excuse me? It has come to the point when we get anxious and

980
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:13,770
we get varied. It's kind of like post traumatic

981
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,538
distress. When it rains, we get anxious.

982
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:22,318
We get scared because we know that our streets are going to

983
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:26,158
hold water. We have been

984
01:03:26,244 --> 01:03:30,154
historically disinvested and disenfranchised.

985
01:03:30,282 --> 01:03:33,586
We would like to have an amendment for the public works to

986
01:03:33,608 --> 01:03:36,958
have more money so they could do something about the flooding in our bipartisan

987
01:03:36,974 --> 01:03:40,466
neighborhoods. Not only that, we want to address the

988
01:03:40,488 --> 01:03:44,626
worst first. We would like for someone to come out to our neighborhoods

989
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:48,920
and start doing some work that alleviate the flooding that's going on.

990
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,946
I'll give you another couple of seconds. Could you define

991
01:03:54,978 --> 01:04:00,602
your neighborhood? My neighborhood is City

992
01:04:00,656 --> 01:04:03,962
Gas Lakewood. The northeast neighborhood. Got it.

993
01:04:04,016 --> 01:04:07,840
District B, we have 88% of

994
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:12,206
open dish drainage, and we

995
01:04:12,228 --> 01:04:15,806
just need some help out there. We need some infrastructure because the infrastructure is

996
01:04:15,828 --> 01:04:19,674
antiquated, right? Yes. We're the worst

997
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:22,778
first. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Ms.

998
01:04:22,794 --> 01:04:23,390
Brown.

999
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:30,946
Ms. Brown. Ms. Brown. Thank council Member Jackson. Thank you,

1000
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:34,974
Ms. Brown, for coming in and for your group,

1001
01:04:35,112 --> 01:04:38,966
for all the work that you guys been doing in the district to make sure

1002
01:04:38,988 --> 01:04:42,534
that we get the resources and get the projects we need to

1003
01:04:42,652 --> 01:04:46,306
mitigate the flooding within District B. The neighborhoods

1004
01:04:46,338 --> 01:04:49,974
are the Northeast, Houston. You have cashmere? Garden, Fifth Ward Acres

1005
01:04:50,022 --> 01:04:53,482
Homes. And so these are neighborhoods that's hit hard every

1006
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:56,618
flood. 88% of the open ditches are in our

1007
01:04:56,704 --> 01:05:01,162
district. That was a ditch study conducted back in 2014

1008
01:05:01,306 --> 01:05:05,022
out of the Hurricane Ike Disaster Recovery Round $2 that

1009
01:05:05,076 --> 01:05:08,986
indicated that we needed some investment within our neighborhoods.

1010
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:12,706
And so I assure you that it's my priority. I will be submitting amendment to

1011
01:05:12,728 --> 01:05:16,782
make sure that we get the resources, some dollars allocated

1012
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:20,514
for ditch maintenance, because if our ditches are not and our drainages are not

1013
01:05:20,552 --> 01:05:24,678
maintenance, that's what causes a lot of the flooding. And we can't depend

1014
01:05:24,764 --> 01:05:28,486
on seniors to do something that we should be

1015
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:31,574
doing. We were doing it at one point. That changed in 2001.

1016
01:05:31,612 --> 01:05:35,146
And so I'm going to make sure that

1017
01:05:35,168 --> 01:05:38,922
we try to get a drainage schedule maintenance regularly within

1018
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:42,140
our district. So thank you all for your advocacy. Thank you.

1019
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:46,330
Thank you. Ms. Becky Seal.

1020
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:53,686
Morning. Hey, good morning.

1021
01:05:53,788 --> 01:05:57,338
I'm Becky Seal with the Northeast Action Collective. And Doris and

1022
01:05:57,344 --> 01:06:00,986
all these people talking that packet we just passed out to you kind

1023
01:06:01,008 --> 01:06:04,266
of, like, elaborates a bit on why we're working with Tarsha

1024
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:08,160
to do this budget amendment and really the details of what we're talking about.

1025
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,998
So I heard you guys say that there is money

1026
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:15,874
for drainage maintenance right now, and we'd like to know if that's different than

1027
01:06:15,912 --> 01:06:19,346
previous years, because the maintenance to this point really

1028
01:06:19,528 --> 01:06:23,506
is not matching the need at all. And if so

1029
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:27,090
or regardless, where can the public see a schedule so that we can

1030
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,950
keep public works accountable to that? So let me ask this question.

1031
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,014
So we're dealing with general fund right now. I think that's dealing with

1032
01:06:35,052 --> 01:06:38,466
capital improvement project dollars. So two different things.

1033
01:06:38,588 --> 01:06:42,186
We will attack CIP probably next month or

1034
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:46,346
so. So if an amendment comes forward within the general fund,

1035
01:06:46,528 --> 01:06:50,826
there has to be a correspondent debit that

1036
01:06:50,848 --> 01:06:53,802
you take away from it and a funding source that's identified.

1037
01:06:53,866 --> 01:06:57,198
And Council Member Jackson will probably submit that as well with her

1038
01:06:57,364 --> 01:07:00,410
amendment. But we will take up CIP.

1039
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:03,774
Am I correct in that? Well, it's both. So there

1040
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:06,946
is an O and M component to this. And I

1041
01:07:06,968 --> 01:07:10,482
do want to clarify, and I hope you will acknowledge that

1042
01:07:10,616 --> 01:07:14,306
Veronica Davis and her team have been very actively engaged with

1043
01:07:14,328 --> 01:07:18,120
this community over the last year and have worked with you to

1044
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:21,858
identify specific locations.

1045
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:25,346
We have actually done surveys of the roadside ditches

1046
01:07:25,378 --> 01:07:27,830
throughout the area, and we've identified, I believe,

1047
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,154
25 different projects that we'll be doing over the next

1048
01:07:31,212 --> 01:07:34,506
18 months in that area that are in our budget that

1049
01:07:34,528 --> 01:07:38,138
are funded to be done. And so I want to make sure that

1050
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:42,106
it's clear that we have responded to, that we

1051
01:07:42,128 --> 01:07:45,742
are actively but that's just the first step. Those are the ones

1052
01:07:45,876 --> 01:07:47,920
that you all have identified that, you know,

1053
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:52,446
we're looking at the entire area out there and working to

1054
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,874
identify those improvements. So we've also done

1055
01:07:55,912 --> 01:07:59,474
the maintenance through the entire area of everything that has been

1056
01:07:59,512 --> 01:08:03,682
identified to us. And there's a difference between true

1057
01:08:03,736 --> 01:08:07,214
maintenance, where it's actually going out, and removing

1058
01:08:07,262 --> 01:08:11,270
silt and soil and things in those ditches and restoring culverts versus

1059
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:15,174
day to day, like, I take care of my

1060
01:08:15,212 --> 01:08:18,666
house, which is making sure that the litter is not getting there,

1061
01:08:18,688 --> 01:08:22,166
and things of that nature throughout

1062
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:25,610
the city. What we ask people to do is that

1063
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,886
light level maintenance, not that heavy

1064
01:08:28,918 --> 01:08:32,166
maintenance that we do. So we've

1065
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:35,294
been working with Veronica Davis a lot. Right. And what she's told

1066
01:08:35,332 --> 01:08:38,794
us is that the money that they have to do proactive

1067
01:08:38,842 --> 01:08:42,206
maintenance is not nearly enough, that it's 500 miles of

1068
01:08:42,228 --> 01:08:46,030
open ditch drainage throughout the entire city per year. And she has said,

1069
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,954
unless we have more money put aside for this, we cannot do

1070
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:53,666
the maintenance required. And we don't think that the only ditches that should

1071
01:08:53,688 --> 01:08:57,294
be maintained is from a group of us who semi professionally

1072
01:08:57,422 --> 01:09:01,510
come to city council and have to put our entire lives into identifying ditches.

1073
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:06,018
Yes, there's been a massive improvement, and it's been amazing to work with Veronica

1074
01:09:06,034 --> 01:09:09,602
Davis. We've really liked working with her and appreciated the response.

1075
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:13,546
But we think that there has to be a shift from that pattern to

1076
01:09:13,568 --> 01:09:16,634
being more proactive. And she specifically has said the only

1077
01:09:16,672 --> 01:09:19,946
way that's possible is if there's more money specifically put for

1078
01:09:19,968 --> 01:09:24,174
that. Yes. And Miss Seal, if you want to look

1079
01:09:24,212 --> 01:09:27,118
up the CIP map that we have,

1080
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:30,266
it can be found@buildhoustonforward.org.

1081
01:09:30,298 --> 01:09:33,370
And you'll see the CIP. Yeah, we've looked at it a lot. But the CIP

1082
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:36,946
projects is not what we're talking about. We're not talking there are two

1083
01:09:36,968 --> 01:09:41,070
buckets of projects. One is general fund and one in CIP.

1084
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:44,260
So we'll get to CIP, but your general fund.

1085
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:48,594
Okay. But in either one, you can't see what the actual

1086
01:09:48,712 --> 01:09:52,658
money for ditch maintenance is. And we've scoured the Internet. If it's

1087
01:09:52,674 --> 01:09:56,166
out there, please send it to us. We're trying to see if there's money in

1088
01:09:56,188 --> 01:10:00,098
one of those overall city line

1089
01:10:00,204 --> 01:10:03,702
in the CIP budget that's going to ditch maintenance.

1090
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,858
What does that mean? And then in the general fund, same thing.

1091
01:10:06,944 --> 01:10:11,206
So that we can if it's already happening spectacular,

1092
01:10:11,318 --> 01:10:14,990
we just want to see it and understand. Council member Tiffany Thomas.

1093
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:19,406
Thank you. In addition to the budget amendment your

1094
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:22,442
council member is going to offer, last year council Member Peck,

1095
01:10:22,586 --> 01:10:26,206
during budget last year authored an amendment for council

1096
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:29,726
members to leverage council district service funds

1097
01:10:29,838 --> 01:10:33,086
to maintain open ditches in our district.

1098
01:10:33,118 --> 01:10:36,546
And I know she's had some successes with that. So in

1099
01:10:36,568 --> 01:10:40,402
addition to that, your council member can couple the work around the timeline

1100
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:43,686
and the schedule that you're requesting, but then also leveraging some

1101
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:47,794
of the dollars she has locally to make sure that the funding

1102
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:51,610
that TDO is limited. To do that, the council office

1103
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,322
can support. That's been great, and you talk too,

1104
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,314
but Ms. Jackson has done a lot with that.

1105
01:10:58,352 --> 01:11:02,026
But that statistic Doris pointed out, 88% of open ditch

1106
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:05,566
maintenance is in non white and

1107
01:11:05,588 --> 01:11:08,954
poor neighborhoods, basically. So every city district

1108
01:11:09,002 --> 01:11:12,574
having some money to put to that doesn't nearly address the problem.

1109
01:11:12,692 --> 01:11:16,398
It's an unequal problem. So there has to be what

1110
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:19,390
I'm clarifying is that you have additional method.

1111
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:22,642
So it's and in both. So in addition to what's showing up in the general

1112
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:25,938
fund and the budget amendment for a timeline, she actually all of

1113
01:11:25,944 --> 01:11:29,666
us have dollars available to support that where TDO

1114
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:33,142
is limited. So it's and in both. Thank you. Thank you.

1115
01:11:33,196 --> 01:11:37,074
Thank you, Miss Sale. Next, we have Ms. Carolyn Addison

1116
01:11:37,122 --> 01:11:37,910
Rivera.

1117
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,968
Good morning. What you see here are recent

1118
01:11:52,144 --> 01:11:55,708
pictures of the ditches

1119
01:11:55,904 --> 01:11:59,268
that we live in and the contamination

1120
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:03,128
that we deal with with water and

1121
01:12:03,294 --> 01:12:06,472
our land. The first thing I want to do is say

1122
01:12:06,526 --> 01:12:09,884
thank you. Okay. The first thing I want

1123
01:12:09,922 --> 01:12:13,436
thank you, sir. Yes, ma'am. The first thing I want

1124
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:17,804
to do is say thank you to the city council and

1125
01:12:17,842 --> 01:12:21,090
to let you know that we need you.

1126
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:25,570
We cannot. This is recent. If you can see this,

1127
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:29,584
this is what we live with every

1128
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:35,136
day. I have been calling Veronica

1129
01:12:35,168 --> 01:12:38,740
Davis and the rest of since 2014,

1130
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,550
pleading for help. I've lived in that community

1131
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,824
over 40 years. When I moved there,

1132
01:12:46,942 --> 01:12:50,472
there was regular maintenance. We had no

1133
01:12:50,526 --> 01:12:53,544
flooding. My children could play.

1134
01:12:53,742 --> 01:12:57,720
This was not in our community. This is

1135
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,788
reason. Just yesterday, I called

1136
01:13:01,954 --> 01:13:06,188
and the guy come out, asked me, what do I want him to do?

1137
01:13:06,274 --> 01:13:09,548
They dig ditches. Well water. Just stand.

1138
01:13:09,714 --> 01:13:13,184
Do you hear me? It just stand. Thank you.

1139
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:17,072
Thank you. Ms. Addison Rivera. Thank you. And thank you very

1140
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:20,816
much. We need you. We can't do it without you.

1141
01:13:20,918 --> 01:13:23,936
This is it reason. Thank you,

1142
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:27,760
ma'am. Appreciate it. Leah Johnson.

1143
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,800
Leah Johnson.

1144
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,760
Benjamin Broadway.

1145
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,650
Thank American.

1146
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:11,840
Mr. Broadway. Morning, sir.

1147
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:21,300
There you go. We're good. Okay. Thank you.

1148
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:24,894
I'm going to get straight to the point. In the Northeast,

1149
01:14:24,942 --> 01:14:29,046
we need sewage and

1150
01:14:29,228 --> 01:14:33,270
runoff. Help our kids stand

1151
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,678
in water when they're waiting for the school bus.

1152
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:39,160
Do your kids wait and stand in water?

1153
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:42,010
They get to school soaking wet.

1154
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:46,298
We need flood help in our area.

1155
01:14:46,384 --> 01:14:49,354
We need the covered ditches. Three,

1156
01:14:49,392 --> 01:14:52,560
one, one is a joke to me

1157
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:57,022
because when I call for help, they have us

1158
01:14:57,076 --> 01:15:00,906
register. Every year, every time we move, when the disabled

1159
01:15:00,938 --> 01:15:04,898
and visually impaired people relocate, they ask us

1160
01:15:04,984 --> 01:15:08,370
to register. I register. I've never gotten one

1161
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:12,002
call from three one one to say, hello. Mr.

1162
01:15:12,056 --> 01:15:15,646
Broadway. Are you okay? Do you need to evacuate?

1163
01:15:15,838 --> 01:15:19,574
My family has had to come in high water vehicles to

1164
01:15:19,612 --> 01:15:23,240
come and get me from my home. So please,

1165
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:26,646
with your help help. District B,

1166
01:15:26,748 --> 01:15:30,726
I'm in Lakewood. I'm one of many disabled

1167
01:15:30,758 --> 01:15:32,380
people that need the help.

1168
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:39,274
Thank you, Mr. Broadway, would you like a couple of seconds of my time

1169
01:15:39,312 --> 01:15:42,654
to complete your statement? Yes.

1170
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:46,142
If there's any way we can try and make

1171
01:15:46,196 --> 01:15:50,158
the system better, because every time we call

1172
01:15:50,244 --> 01:15:54,678
with even simple things of loose animals

1173
01:15:54,874 --> 01:15:58,206
because I can't walk to my mailbox without trying to get attacked

1174
01:15:58,238 --> 01:15:59,140
by a dog,

1175
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:04,590
and the flooding issues, here I am facing

1176
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:08,502
another hurricane season. I'm terrified from a small

1177
01:16:08,556 --> 01:16:11,846
rain. I don't know if my area is

1178
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:15,446
going to flood because the covered ditches, they have so

1179
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:18,690
much in them. Thank you. Council member Tasha Jackson.

1180
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:23,014
I just wanted to thank them for coming in and sharing their concerns.

1181
01:16:23,062 --> 01:16:26,618
And then also just to piggyback on what Director Haddock did

1182
01:16:26,704 --> 01:16:30,122
say about the SWAT projects slated for the area,

1183
01:16:30,176 --> 01:16:33,738
and we doing the H and H studies. I think we just completed the

1184
01:16:33,744 --> 01:16:37,070
H and H studies to actually show why these particular

1185
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:41,258
neighborhoods are draining. I mean, it's true that there has been no investment,

1186
01:16:41,434 --> 01:16:44,558
why these neighborhoods are flooding. There has been no investment. And now we

1187
01:16:44,564 --> 01:16:47,858
are getting the studies to identify why these neighborhoods are

1188
01:16:47,864 --> 01:16:51,326
flooding. And then the next round is the fixing,

1189
01:16:51,358 --> 01:16:54,514
the mitigating, these flooding. I mean, we have train tracks. We're always talking

1190
01:16:54,552 --> 01:16:57,986
about the trains that's contributing to a lot of the flooding. So I just

1191
01:16:58,008 --> 01:17:01,506
want to assure you that there has been a lot of movement and we're

1192
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:04,886
doing a lot of work. We had a lot of projects slated for the

1193
01:17:04,908 --> 01:17:08,438
district to address the flooding. But then also, we do need

1194
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:11,958
a ditch maintenance schedule. So I'm with you on that.

1195
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:15,866
And, of course, Director Haddock said there's resources already in

1196
01:17:15,888 --> 01:17:19,622
this budget for that. And so I'm going to have further conversations just to identify

1197
01:17:19,766 --> 01:17:22,618
what is the amount, how much do it cost. If I have to use some

1198
01:17:22,624 --> 01:17:26,282
of my district service funds, I will use some of my district service

1199
01:17:26,336 --> 01:17:29,626
funds, but I have to use for parks and the illegal dumping

1200
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:32,926
and all these other things. So a million dollars only goes so far.

1201
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:36,126
So I want to try to work with the departments and see if we can

1202
01:17:36,148 --> 01:17:39,682
find resources to move some of these projects. So thank you again for coming.

1203
01:17:39,816 --> 01:17:43,154
Thank you. Thank you, Chair, and thank you, sir, for coming. This question

1204
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:47,230
is for the Public Works Director. So the document they provided,

1205
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:51,342
it said prior to 2001, we did regular maintenance.

1206
01:17:51,406 --> 01:17:55,010
The city did regular maintenance of roadside ditches.

1207
01:17:56,790 --> 01:18:00,250
And now we just go based on three one on complaints.

1208
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:04,650
Did the city ever have a policy where we regularly maintained,

1209
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:07,946
I'll be honest with you, council Member, I do not know the answer to that

1210
01:18:07,968 --> 01:18:11,478
question. I'm going to have to get with and Eric Dargan joined

1211
01:18:11,494 --> 01:18:14,686
the city in 2002. I joined in

1212
01:18:14,868 --> 01:18:16,160
2005.

1213
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:24,926
I'm unaware of that. But I also do know that there

1214
01:18:24,948 --> 01:18:28,130
were a lot of things that in the late ninety s and early

1215
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,698
2000s, because of the limitations on

1216
01:18:31,704 --> 01:18:34,900
the general fund, which at the time was in the general fund,

1217
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:39,526
were not able to continue forward. So I do not know the answer to that

1218
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:43,142
question because I've always been under the impression we did more

1219
01:18:43,196 --> 01:18:46,306
major regrading and things like that on a regular schedule.

1220
01:18:46,338 --> 01:18:50,306
But the maintenance itself, like the mowing, I mean, these pictures

1221
01:18:50,338 --> 01:18:53,500
are way more than just mowing needed. I mean, that's a different situation.

1222
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:57,020
But that was the property owner's responsibility. Thank you.

1223
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:00,010
Malberth Moses.

1224
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,240
Good morning.

1225
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:16,686
I don't understand why I'm have to come up here and fight for what's

1226
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,740
supposed to be our rights in the first place.

1227
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:24,242
I moved in my neighborhood over 50

1228
01:19:24,296 --> 01:19:28,258
years ago and it was predominantly white neighborhood. I couldn't

1229
01:19:28,274 --> 01:19:31,350
even go outside the plate till you choose because being

1230
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:35,298
attacked. But they had a regular schedule

1231
01:19:35,474 --> 01:19:39,326
of keeping up the ditch maintenance, picking up the heavy

1232
01:19:39,378 --> 01:19:43,434
trash. But then as the neighborhood began to

1233
01:19:43,472 --> 01:19:47,898
grow more black

1234
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:50,890
and brown, all of a sudden this stopped.

1235
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:55,586
And I don't see why all stopped all of

1236
01:19:55,588 --> 01:20:00,510
a sudden. Why we just got took off the schedule altogether.

1237
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:04,314
I haven't seen anybody come in that neighborhood in over 20 years

1238
01:20:04,372 --> 01:20:08,270
to clean the ditches. And that's ridiculous

1239
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:10,900
because we deserve that, right?

1240
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:16,146
So can somebody answer that question? Why do I have

1241
01:20:16,168 --> 01:20:19,526
to come up here and fight for a right that I already deserve? Thank you,

1242
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:22,546
Mr. Moses. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

1243
01:20:22,738 --> 01:20:25,320
I'm sorry. Thank you.

1244
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:29,978
I'm sorry. Vice chair, Ed Pollard. Thank you

1245
01:20:29,984 --> 01:20:33,418
sir, for coming in. Your comment, this is

1246
01:20:33,424 --> 01:20:37,782
for public Works. When you all are going out and identifying projects

1247
01:20:37,926 --> 01:20:41,930
and infrastructure needs for improvements to the drainage,

1248
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:47,120
or is there some type of list

1249
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:50,800
that you all have put together to

1250
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:55,162
be able to understand what are the drainage and infrastructure

1251
01:20:55,226 --> 01:20:58,434
needs for that particular area? Has that

1252
01:20:58,472 --> 01:21:02,482
been shared to the public? Do we have a cost estimate for

1253
01:21:02,616 --> 01:21:06,302
some of those improvements so that we as council can be better abreast

1254
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:10,194
on what could be done to alleviate

1255
01:21:10,242 --> 01:21:13,858
some of these issues? That the community I will interject.

1256
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:17,558
Each district gets $2 million in SWAT projects designated by

1257
01:21:17,564 --> 01:21:21,042
their council members. I know we do that. And every other district receives

1258
01:21:21,106 --> 01:21:24,314
2 million in SWAT projects. I'm not sure where your neighbor is

1259
01:21:24,352 --> 01:21:27,466
on the District B project list, but we do have

1260
01:21:27,488 --> 01:21:30,860
the ability to do that what I'm speaking of is just general,

1261
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:35,582
not swap projects because those are smaller, like 2 million

1262
01:21:35,636 --> 01:21:39,918
a year projects. What I'm saying is like an overall high level view

1263
01:21:40,004 --> 01:21:43,226
of infrastructure needs when it pertains

1264
01:21:43,258 --> 01:21:46,674
to drainage and maintenance for an area like District B that has

1265
01:21:46,712 --> 01:21:50,242
a lot of open ditches. So I may

1266
01:21:50,296 --> 01:21:54,686
ask Veronica to come up and join us, but it's

1267
01:21:54,718 --> 01:21:58,306
been in the last decade through this administration that we've

1268
01:21:58,338 --> 01:22:01,878
actually gone out and surveyed Ditches Citywide to have an idea on

1269
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:05,522
what the capacity of those ditches are. And we're

1270
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:09,890
currently working on a condition assessment for Ditches Citywide,

1271
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:13,578
which would give us more of that answer. We did have from the

1272
01:22:13,664 --> 01:22:17,414
late 90s, early two thousand s, a capacity

1273
01:22:17,462 --> 01:22:21,500
assessment of the Pipe Systems Citywide. And so this is

1274
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:25,374
that data driving. And so to be more

1275
01:22:25,412 --> 01:22:27,840
proactive, you have to have that citywide data.

1276
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,654
In lieu of having that data. We did rely a lot

1277
01:22:32,692 --> 01:22:36,046
on the three one one reports, and that's what we're working with the

1278
01:22:36,068 --> 01:22:39,186
council member right now. When would the

1279
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:43,410
data be available for you all to do an assessment?

1280
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:47,602
Good morning, everyone. Well, good afternoon at this point. So.

1281
01:22:47,656 --> 01:22:51,266
Veronica Davis, director of Transportation and Drainage operations in Houston

1282
01:22:51,298 --> 01:22:54,994
Public Works. So one, we're working on our stormwater master

1283
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:59,574
plan. So the city up until now has never had a full master plan.

1284
01:22:59,772 --> 01:23:02,966
So currently, right now, we should be going to a notice

1285
01:23:02,998 --> 01:23:06,326
to proceed very soon. And so there'll be a couple of components

1286
01:23:06,358 --> 01:23:10,138
with that. So part of it will be doing an H and H

1287
01:23:10,304 --> 01:23:14,154
hydraulics analysis for the city to be able to understand these

1288
01:23:14,192 --> 01:23:17,806
needs, and then two, to be able to think about what

1289
01:23:17,828 --> 01:23:21,614
is the full need that we have for the city. We have

1290
01:23:21,652 --> 01:23:25,518
have other plans that have been done that we will pull into this process

1291
01:23:25,604 --> 01:23:29,346
to help inform some of that. And I also want to clarify what

1292
01:23:29,368 --> 01:23:33,106
we do generally, we do rely on three one one right

1293
01:23:33,128 --> 01:23:36,686
now for digit maintenance. And so we do send our digital maintenance crews

1294
01:23:36,718 --> 01:23:40,534
out to do the regrading to do the desilting. Once it is

1295
01:23:40,572 --> 01:23:44,390
beyond the ability of our internal crews to do, we do refer

1296
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:47,926
it to either SWAT, which we work with the council members on.

1297
01:23:48,028 --> 01:23:51,718
We also have the local drainage program. And so we have been working with

1298
01:23:51,804 --> 01:23:55,790
the Northeast Action Collective. We have projects right now that are indesigned.

1299
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:59,846
We do our design in house. So we are currently working on projects

1300
01:23:59,878 --> 01:24:03,530
that are indesigned. And in the new fiscal year, we'll be going to construction

1301
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:08,110
to address some of the concerns that have been brought up by the collective.

1302
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:11,310
Thank you, Ms. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Moses.

1303
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:15,614
Council Member David Robinson. I'm sorry, this one was with Mr.

1304
01:24:15,652 --> 01:24:19,026
Moses in mind, but basically a comment wanting to

1305
01:24:19,048 --> 01:24:22,402
thank the Northeast Action Collective for being here.

1306
01:24:22,456 --> 01:24:25,934
I think in addition to what we just heard from Ms. Davis and the director.

1307
01:24:25,982 --> 01:24:29,410
I think there are some really positive trends.

1308
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:33,282
This is slow coming. And your patience and observations

1309
01:24:33,346 --> 01:24:37,250
in the neighborhood, we understand why that's a grievance, why that's

1310
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:41,618
not fair and not right and not satisfactory. So I think moving forward,

1311
01:24:41,724 --> 01:24:45,574
what we've heard today are some of the very progressive actions

1312
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:49,158
that are being taken. They need to happen faster, in my opinion.

1313
01:24:49,254 --> 01:24:53,102
And part of what we're doing together, with your input, with your

1314
01:24:53,156 --> 01:24:56,510
group and with some of the tools that the Director mentioned

1315
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:59,998
is detect problems sooner, work on them

1316
01:25:00,084 --> 01:25:03,802
more proactively, with an inventory of those ditches,

1317
01:25:03,866 --> 01:25:07,310
those pipes, and where we can be more effective

1318
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:11,330
and more fair, more equitable with our dollars. And working

1319
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:15,266
across this huge city, But I think the literature that

1320
01:25:15,288 --> 01:25:19,182
you all have brought today is really well done. It's compelling,

1321
01:25:19,246 --> 01:25:22,534
it's instructive, and it points a path to where

1322
01:25:22,572 --> 01:25:26,086
the worst first can be prioritized. So I want to salute you,

1323
01:25:26,108 --> 01:25:29,202
Mr. Moses, and thank you for coming today. Thank you.

1324
01:25:29,356 --> 01:25:30,810
James Burford.

1325
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:47,636
James Burford. Got you.

1326
01:25:47,738 --> 01:25:49,060
Sandra Edwards.

1327
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:09,066
Good morning, everybody. I'm not

1328
01:26:09,088 --> 01:26:11,626
going to even hold you all along because everything I want to say has been

1329
01:26:11,648 --> 01:26:14,894
said, has been said already. This is just

1330
01:26:14,932 --> 01:26:18,030
a map of the community in the neighborhood. I'm from I'm from two six.

1331
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,678
Okay, the council closed and all that good stuff. Okay, I just want

1332
01:26:21,684 --> 01:26:25,438
to say one thing. You all need to put first things first. I know you

1333
01:26:25,444 --> 01:26:27,906
all been hearing all this and I know you're tired of hearing all this because

1334
01:26:27,928 --> 01:26:30,802
we're tired of saying it, but can you all put first things first?

1335
01:26:30,856 --> 01:26:34,162
We didn't showed you the proof. That what we need. It's not like we're asking

1336
01:26:34,216 --> 01:26:37,586
for it because this is just we feel we better. They think they better because

1337
01:26:37,608 --> 01:26:40,694
they get everything that needs to come their way. For you to come to our

1338
01:26:40,732 --> 01:26:44,482
area, can you put first things first? Come to our area, do some cleanup,

1339
01:26:44,546 --> 01:26:47,722
clean some drainages. Maybe we won't flood so much and

1340
01:26:47,776 --> 01:26:51,430
stop these people from going against us, our communities,

1341
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:54,262
and bringing in stuff that's going to make us flood,

1342
01:26:54,406 --> 01:26:57,950
stopping up our drainages and everything. Just do the

1343
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:01,406
right thing for once. That's all I got to say. Do something right for

1344
01:27:01,428 --> 01:27:04,430
a change. Thank you. Julia arduna.

1345
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:07,470
Julia Arduna.

1346
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:11,090
Anil Kapoor.

1347
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:27,546
Okay, thank you, council people,

1348
01:27:27,648 --> 01:27:31,066
for having us come in today to speak and giving us

1349
01:27:31,088 --> 01:27:34,414
a chance to speak. Before I talk, I do want

1350
01:27:34,452 --> 01:27:38,622
to express my gratitude to Veronica Davis and her

1351
01:27:38,676 --> 01:27:42,126
department. In a little less than a year, her and

1352
01:27:42,148 --> 01:27:46,186
her office have been way more impactful for our neighborhood

1353
01:27:46,298 --> 01:27:50,274
and our collective and the residents that have been there for over 20 years

1354
01:27:50,392 --> 01:27:52,980
than any of the previous people in her position.

1355
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:57,814
Also want to thank Tasha Jackson for being open and working with us

1356
01:27:57,852 --> 01:27:59,510
as well and being accessible.

1357
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:04,390
I just want to read this prepared statement.

1358
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:09,606
We would love for the city council to amend a

1359
01:28:09,628 --> 01:28:13,350
public works budget to include a pilot program for drainage maintenance

1360
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:17,494
in district B. Specifically, it is one of the most flood prone areas

1361
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:21,606
and has very high concentrations of BIPOC and LMI

1362
01:28:21,638 --> 01:28:25,182
people, as well as public housing. Open ditch drainage is an example

1363
01:28:25,236 --> 01:28:29,130
of separate and unequal that leaves our communities vulnerable.

1364
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:33,310
It's essential that we invest before the next hurricane and disaster.

1365
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:37,714
Our seal thank you. Supposed to rise 18 inches. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1366
01:28:37,752 --> 01:28:40,530
Appreciate it. David espinoza.

1367
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,476
Have Mr. Espinoza, then followed by Mr. Butler, and that will

1368
01:28:47,498 --> 01:28:50,680
conclude the public speakers. Mr. Espinoza.

1369
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:56,170
Good afternoon. My name is David. I'm from district b.

1370
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:00,312
I want to say that I used to be in

1371
01:29:00,446 --> 01:29:03,820
just about the same predicament as my colleagues in the NAC.

1372
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:11,100
About a half a year ago, there was some development

1373
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,830
right along little York and epson road.

1374
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,096
And around the same time, there was also commercial

1375
01:29:19,128 --> 01:29:21,890
development. There was a couple of fast food places going up.

1376
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:26,320
And at the same time, there was a road maintenance,

1377
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,700
which came along with ditch maintenance.

1378
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,340
And my family saw a dramatic improvement

1379
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,100
from the flooding we got we used to have

1380
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:41,130
we couldn't get out of our neighborhood when it when it was flooded real bad.

1381
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:45,044
But that's proof that ditch maintenance

1382
01:29:45,092 --> 01:29:47,770
widening ditches, making them deeper, cleaning them out,

1383
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:51,916
it's not regular, but we do our best to keep

1384
01:29:52,018 --> 01:29:54,940
our trash out, me and my neighbors,

1385
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,356
and so far, we've been doing good so far,

1386
01:29:59,538 --> 01:30:04,556
and I want to see that happening throughout the northeast with my fellow

1387
01:30:04,588 --> 01:30:07,552
members, to see them live better. Thank you, Mr.

1388
01:30:07,606 --> 01:30:11,200
Espinoza. Thank you, Mr.

1389
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:12,160
Butler.

1390
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:19,410
You're the last one we can say good morning to, so we will. Good morning.

1391
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,680
Good afternoon.

1392
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:28,850
My name is Broderick Butler, and I'm a resident of district b.

1393
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:33,184
Those are my neighbors, and our message is pretty consistent.

1394
01:30:33,232 --> 01:30:36,308
Along with getting things done faster, we'd like for things to

1395
01:30:36,314 --> 01:30:39,780
be done properly and consistently.

1396
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:44,120
Council member Robinson, with all due respect,

1397
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:48,520
this is the first time I'm hearing these staff names, and I've long since

1398
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:52,312
wanted the senior management to

1399
01:30:52,366 --> 01:30:55,884
come to our district and talk to people on their level

1400
01:30:56,002 --> 01:30:59,260
about a problem that you've heard from

1401
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:02,328
multiple people over a period of decades.

1402
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:06,590
So my questions directed to the director are,

1403
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,756
who makes the decision where money is spent in their department in regards

1404
01:31:11,788 --> 01:31:15,388
to our district and infrastructure projects?

1405
01:31:15,484 --> 01:31:19,276
I also want to know, again this question of scheduling.

1406
01:31:19,388 --> 01:31:23,124
There are people that have lived in this community their entire lives, and they've seen

1407
01:31:23,162 --> 01:31:25,796
things go away. They're not lying to you.

1408
01:31:25,978 --> 01:31:29,728
Lastly, there's a water treatment plant. There's still a disconnect there's

1409
01:31:29,744 --> 01:31:33,056
a water treatment plant that was created in the northeast.

1410
01:31:33,168 --> 01:31:36,740
No one knows it even exists that lives in the northeast.

1411
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:40,260
So I would say to you, this department,

1412
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:43,690
while it has done a lot of good for us,

1413
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:47,500
we need some more reaching out to this community

1414
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:51,896
to talk about solving the problems that exist.

1415
01:31:52,008 --> 01:31:55,436
Thank you. Thank you. And I have some additional questions that

1416
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:57,020
I'd like to submit in writing.

1417
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,504
We will put those into SharePoint. That concludes

1418
01:32:02,552 --> 01:32:06,380
the Houston Public Works Budget workshop. Thank you,

1419
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:10,212
Director Haddock. Thank you,

1420
01:32:10,306 --> 01:32:13,264
Director Salanki. Appreciate your insight.
