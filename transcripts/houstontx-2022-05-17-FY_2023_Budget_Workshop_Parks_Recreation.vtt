WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:05.786
And council staff like to welcome Council Member

00:05.818 --> 00:06.750
Amy Peck.

00:49.040 --> 01:01.284
I can't even see that because the Claire so

01:01.322 --> 01:04.516
at this time I'd like to welcome Director Kenneth Allen and Miss

01:04.538 --> 01:07.924
Cheryl Johnson. Provide the

01:08.042 --> 01:11.830
Houston Parks and Recreation Department budget. Good morning.

01:12.520 --> 01:16.184
Good morning. Good morning. See, everybody is smiling and ready to go

01:16.222 --> 01:19.208
right there. All right, well, good morning.

01:19.374 --> 01:22.916
Thank you pro Tim and City Council

01:23.028 --> 01:26.956
for just allowing us to present and your continuous support of

01:26.978 --> 01:30.396
the Houston Parks and Recreation Department. Certainly over

01:30.418 --> 01:33.944
the last three years, we've had to adjust and pivot

01:34.072 --> 01:37.676
and make things work the best that we can.

01:37.778 --> 01:41.208
Partnering with other directors, other partners,

01:41.304 --> 01:44.684
has certainly been a challenge to deliver just regular parks

01:44.732 --> 01:48.368
and recreation services. But when you think about us being as

01:48.454 --> 01:52.312
Lily Paz, shelter sites, distribution sites,

01:52.476 --> 01:56.516
just really doing things to accommodate the needs of the

01:56.538 --> 01:59.716
public, I am so proud of the team that I have

01:59.738 --> 02:02.630
the honor and pleasure of managing day to day.

02:03.260 --> 02:06.744
And these are guys and women with boots on the ground that

02:06.782 --> 02:10.628
are actually delittering our parks, actually mowing,

02:10.724 --> 02:12.680
actually repairing roofs,

02:13.340 --> 02:16.856
plumbing, and the staff that work with our children day

02:16.878 --> 02:20.984
to day. I am so very proud of them because they go beyond

02:21.112 --> 02:24.856
and above the call of duty. They work with the resources

02:24.888 --> 02:28.348
that we have, sometime limited. But guess what?

02:28.514 --> 02:32.144
They've made a way out of no way. And we do have some

02:32.182 --> 02:35.984
gaps, but we are striving to continue to

02:36.102 --> 02:39.488
provide services the best we can with what we have. So I

02:39.494 --> 02:42.084
want to honor them and I want to thank them for their day to day

02:42.122 --> 02:45.664
effort. It takes a huge coordination

02:45.712 --> 02:49.716
effort with my executive team working hand

02:49.738 --> 02:53.124
in hand with their direct reports. And I have them with me

02:53.162 --> 02:56.612
today. I like to introduce have many of them with me today.

02:56.666 --> 03:00.516

05:22.928 --> 05:26.996
well maintained parks and offering affordable programming

by a standard of care, which is a mandatory requirement

05:50.108 --> 05:53.420
for our after school and summer enrichment programs.

land expansions,

06:23.060 --> 06:26.548

all part building codes, fire codes, health codes,

06:33.832 --> 06:37.452
american with Disabilities Act. And then when you guys think about

06:37.506 --> 06:39.740
it, our entire inventory,

06:40.960 --> 06:44.524
we have maintenance, and we maintain over 39,000 acres

06:44.572 --> 06:48.604
of land of parkland. This includes over 380

06:48.652 --> 06:51.752
parks. And then we also take care of espionage,

06:51.916 --> 06:55.392
urban forest, natural resources,

06:55.536 --> 06:59.060
sports fields, trails, trees, and we also

06:59.130 --> 07:02.452
maintain the grounds for the library as well as multi service

07:02.506 --> 07:04.970
centers. Next slide, please.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.712
That's a huge inventory, and it takes teamwork and working

07:08.766 --> 07:12.330
together and working with council and partners to

07:14.220 --> 07:18.076
adequately serve the public. We're short in some areas and

07:18.098 --> 07:22.044
we'll identify those, but I want to go to our revenues by

07:22.082 --> 07:26.520
fund. If you look at our proposed budget revenues

07:26.680 --> 07:30.320
by Fund for FY 23, we have our general

07:30.390 --> 07:35.410
fund budget, we're proposing 793,000.

07:35.780 --> 07:39.250
We have Fund 2100, which is our revenue fund.

07:40.260 --> 07:44.576
Our proposed budget is 3 million, and that's

07:44.608 --> 07:47.984
actually for events, birthday parties,

07:48.112 --> 07:51.104
park facilities, team registrations,

07:51.232 --> 07:54.900
tree violation, fines, lake Houston rentals,

07:54.980 --> 07:58.724
and the rentals for tennis centers in terms of revenue.

07:58.852 --> 08:02.490
And then we have Fund 21 four, our golf revenue fund,

08:03.500 --> 08:07.116
we're anticipating or expecting 7.8

08:07.138 --> 08:10.892
million in revenue for Fund 21 five,

08:10.946 --> 08:14.856
our maintenance, renewal and replacement, we're proposing

08:14.968 --> 08:18.648
2.6 million. And then Fund

08:18.754 --> 08:21.580
21 six, which is our bio greenways,

08:21.660 --> 08:24.496
2021.4 million.

08:24.678 --> 08:28.124
Next slide, please. Terms of FY

08:28.172 --> 08:31.200
23 revenue and some of the highlights.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.044
This is our proposed FY 23 budget. Compared to

08:35.082 --> 08:38.356
our FY 22 estimate. You look at our

08:38.378 --> 08:40.150
general fund 1000,

08:42.280 --> 08:46.390
we're saying 1000 less.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.036
So I know that's not significant, but the fact that it's it's

08:50.068 --> 08:53.624
less wanted that to be known. Look at Fund

08:53.662 --> 08:57.596
2100 special revenue, we're proposing to make

08:57.778 --> 09:01.468
468,000

09:01.634 --> 09:05.384
more. And this is budget revenue that's projected

09:05.432 --> 09:08.956
because of pre pandemic trends.

09:09.068 --> 09:12.524
Also contributions from the Astros Golf

09:12.572 --> 09:16.512
Foundation for playground initiatives. So if you look at 21 four

09:16.566 --> 09:19.836
in terms of golf revenue, in terms of highlights,

09:20.028 --> 09:23.970
we're proposing 565,000.

09:25.540 --> 09:29.008
We're hosting the Houston Open once again, and we're projected

09:29.024 --> 09:32.420
to increase some streams of revenue for golf as a result

09:32.490 --> 09:35.816
of the tournament and some of the things that we're doing with

09:35.838 --> 09:38.888
the Open. We look at Fund 21 Five,

09:39.054 --> 09:41.640
maintenance, renewal, and replacement.

09:41.980 --> 09:45.792
We're projecting 300,000 contributions

09:45.876 --> 09:49.576
again, from the Astros Golf Foundation. For neighborhood

09:49.608 --> 09:53.164
park projects, we're looking at Fund 21 six,

09:53.282 --> 09:57.532
bio greenways, we're projecting 270K

09:57.586 --> 10:00.690
for that. Next slide, please.

10:02.020 --> 10:05.132
Expenditures by fund. This is FY

10:05.196 --> 10:08.850
20 three's budget compared to FY 22.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.588
Look at Fund and I'll go in more detail with this slide as we move,

10:13.674 --> 10:17.476
as we progress through the presentation. But if you look at Fund

10:17.578 --> 10:22.004
1000, our general fund, we're looking at over 8 million in

10:22.042 --> 10:25.736
expenses, right? You look at Fund 2100,

10:25.838 --> 10:31.272
special revenue, fund 274k

10:31.406 --> 10:34.680
in expenses, fund 21 Four,

10:34.750 --> 10:38.670
our golf revenue Fund, looking at 894,000,

10:39.360 --> 10:42.904
fund 21 Five, maintenance, renewal and replacement,

10:43.032 --> 10:46.460
343,000. And Fund 21

10:46.530 --> 10:49.424
six, our bio greenways 2020,

10:49.542 --> 10:53.440
we're looking at 22,000 in expenses.

10:53.780 --> 10:57.600
So next slide, please. Fund 1000,

10:57.750 --> 11:02.080
FY 23 personnel versus non personnel.

11:02.440 --> 11:06.932
Personnel is 54% of the budget. That's at 46.6

11:06.986 --> 11:10.768
million. Non personnel is 46% of the budget

11:10.864 --> 11:13.744
at 40 million. Next slide,

11:13.792 --> 11:17.696
please. Special revenue,

11:17.808 --> 11:21.596
2100. Personnel versus non personnel

11:21.648 --> 11:25.192
for FY 23 personnel is 34%

11:25.246 --> 11:29.224
of the budget at 1.1 million, and non personnel

11:29.272 --> 11:32.670
is 66% of the budget at 2.2 million.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.972
Next slide, please. So,

11:37.026 --> 11:40.140
for our golf special revenue,

11:40.300 --> 11:44.256
21 Four, personnel, 59% of

11:44.278 --> 11:48.300
the budget at 4.7 million, and non personnel,

11:48.460 --> 11:51.830
41% of the budget at 3.2 million.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.830
Next slide, please.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.764
For our maintenance, renewal and replacement, fund 21

11:59.882 --> 12:04.104
Five, personnel is 35% of the budget at

12:04.142 --> 12:07.768
1.1 million. And then we have non personnel at 65% of

12:07.774 --> 12:10.170
the budget at 2.1 million.

12:11.340 --> 12:14.792
Next slide, please. So,

12:14.846 --> 12:17.932
Valo Greenways 2020, fund 21 six,

12:18.066 --> 12:21.932
we have personnel at 83% of the budget at 1 million,

12:22.066 --> 12:26.030
and we have non personnel at 17% of the budget at

12:27.200 --> 12:30.524
212,000. Next slide,

12:30.652 --> 12:34.690
please. So this slide actually is

12:36.740 --> 12:40.192
it compares FY 22s budget to FY 23

12:40.246 --> 12:44.100
proposed budget, and it describes the changes between

12:44.170 --> 12:46.870
the budgets. Next slide, please.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.268
If you look at when we focus on 22, as was an

12:51.274 --> 12:54.664
adopted budget, the operating budget was

12:54.782 --> 12:58.840
58 million. And then the restricted budget,

12:59.420 --> 13:03.112
we looked at 9.5. And with a total

13:03.166 --> 13:08.684
budget for FY 22, which was adopted at 67.2

13:08.722 --> 13:12.636
million. And then moving from FY 22 adopted budget to

13:12.658 --> 13:16.568
the FY 22 current change, we had the following adjustments

13:16.664 --> 13:20.720
made. We had an restricted account and adjustments for

13:20.870 --> 13:24.144
58 million. And then we had hope adjustments that

13:24.182 --> 13:28.290
went to 726,000. And then

13:28.740 --> 13:31.824
healthcare benefits. As far as active civilians,

13:31.952 --> 13:34.950
there was a reduction actually of 103,000,

13:35.880 --> 13:37.936
council surplus,

13:38.128 --> 13:41.844
98,000. And then the zoo contract in

13:41.882 --> 13:45.348
terms of annual payment, 10.5 million.

13:45.514 --> 13:49.272
So after combining those adjustments, there was 11.3

13:49.326 --> 13:52.584
million. And we got to our FY 22 current

13:52.622 --> 13:55.370
budget of 78.6 million.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.230
Next slide, please.

13:59.280 --> 14:03.304
Moving from FY 22, our current budget to FY

14:03.352 --> 14:07.048
23, we made the following budget adjustments.

14:07.224 --> 14:11.148
You look at health care benefits for civilians and long term disability,

14:11.324 --> 14:14.624
310,000. FY 22

14:14.662 --> 14:20.464
Hope Allowances, we look at 251,023.

14:20.502 --> 14:21.620
Hope allowance.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.984
960,000. Minimum wage adjustments,

14:26.112 --> 14:30.000
149,000. Municipal pension,

14:30.080 --> 14:34.200
224. As far as a reduction,

14:34.540 --> 14:38.584
so that was good news. You look at restricted accounts at

14:38.622 --> 14:42.180
221,000, and then the Zoo CIP

14:42.260 --> 14:50.636
increase at 520,000.

14:50.818 --> 14:54.972
All right, we have new facility allowance. This is the A leaf, bringing that on

14:55.106 --> 14:58.440
at 588,000. And then I

14:58.450 --> 15:02.176
love our park initiatives that's been so beneficial to

15:02.198 --> 15:05.824
neighborhoods, about 5 million. So we

15:05.862 --> 15:10.352
get to the FY 23 proposed budget of 86.6

15:10.406 --> 15:14.288
million, which is a 10.3% increase

15:14.464 --> 15:17.750
for the current budget. Next slide, please.

15:19.720 --> 15:23.204
We look at expenditures from 23. In terms of

15:23.242 --> 15:27.128
expenditure highlights, we had some variances between

15:27.214 --> 15:31.320
FY 23 and FY 22 budget.

15:31.820 --> 15:35.696
All of the increases were due to Hope allowances,

15:35.828 --> 15:38.700
minimum wage adjustments, and related benefits.

15:38.850 --> 15:42.780
So explaining this by fund, you look at 1000,

15:42.850 --> 15:46.088
our General fund. There's an $8 million

15:46.264 --> 15:49.740
difference. This increase is in restricted accounts

15:49.820 --> 15:53.132
and funding for the Mayor's Love Our Parks Initiative

15:53.276 --> 15:57.312
Fund, 2100. Special revenue is 274,000.

15:57.366 --> 16:00.840
And this is a purchase

16:00.940 --> 16:04.884
of sports fill vehicles to maintain our fields and

16:04.922 --> 16:08.548
our inventory for Fields fund 21 four.

16:08.634 --> 16:14.040
As far as golf revenue, it's 894,000

16:14.190 --> 16:18.184
for increased maintenance costs and upgrades to the course.

16:18.382 --> 16:22.404
To ensure that we meet the PGA standard to deliver

16:22.452 --> 16:25.636
the tournament here in Houston,

16:25.748 --> 16:30.430
we have our maintenance renewal and replacement of 343,000.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.904
This is due to an increase in maintenance and park maintenance and repair

16:34.952 --> 16:38.830
cost. You look at fund 21 six,

16:39.600 --> 16:43.728
greenway, greenways, 2020 of 34,000.

16:43.894 --> 16:47.280
This is mainly the purchase of new vehicles and equipment.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.592
This actually concludes our budget presentation.

16:52.656 --> 16:55.748
I went through it pretty quick. You guys may have questions.

16:55.914 --> 16:59.936
We also have some department demographics and accomplishments

17:00.048 --> 17:02.070
in the appendix in the back.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.984
I like to open this up for questions. I want to thank my team for

17:07.022 --> 17:09.370
certainly joining me. That's behind me.

17:10.620 --> 17:13.864
Thank you. Thank you. We have a couple of council members

17:13.902 --> 17:16.700
in queue. We'll start off with council member Abby Cayman.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.830
Thank you so much, Director. And the entire team.

17:22.080 --> 17:25.292
Really quickly, on page 16, the health

17:25.346 --> 17:31.296
benefit adjustment, the 103. Can you just explain a

17:31.318 --> 17:32.610
little bit more on that?

17:37.150 --> 17:40.954
Health benefits for active civilians in terms of the

17:40.992 --> 17:44.494
reduction of 203 I'm sorry,

17:44.532 --> 17:46.240
$103,000.

17:49.250 --> 17:53.360
Could you elaborate on that for me, please? Yeah, it's mostly due to

17:53.890 --> 17:57.230
when we look at the health benefits for the active civilians,

17:58.390 --> 18:02.526
when people retire, your employees retire and we bring on new employees,

18:02.718 --> 18:07.042
we budget them at the lowest health

18:07.096 --> 18:10.402
benefit rate in hopes that they're going to come

18:10.456 --> 18:14.182
in. And so we budget for just lower

18:14.316 --> 18:18.162
than if somebody retire after being there 32, 35 years somewhere.

18:18.226 --> 18:21.706
Okay, understood. I wasn't sure if that was a COVID correlation or what.

18:21.728 --> 18:24.620
It just stood out to me. Thank you.

18:27.550 --> 18:29.690
While we never wanted a pandemic,

18:31.070 --> 18:34.586
still wish we weren't dealing with some of it. But one of the things that

18:34.608 --> 18:38.702
came out of it was the greater appreciation I think we have for being outside

18:38.836 --> 18:42.734
and the services that you all provide day in and day out for

18:42.772 --> 18:46.426
our park system and not just the enjoyment of the outdoors, but Director,

18:46.458 --> 18:50.046
to your point, the support we provide for our youth through

18:50.068 --> 18:53.826
the Parks program I know you talked about the Meals program. Every year

18:53.848 --> 18:56.866
I bring up one of my favorite programs we do at the city is the

18:56.888 --> 19:00.214
after school programs, not only giving

19:00.332 --> 19:04.034
kids a safe place to be while their parents

19:04.082 --> 19:07.622
may still be at work, but the folks that work

19:07.676 --> 19:11.954
in your department are providing tutoring crafts.

19:12.082 --> 19:15.974
I remember one night I was at a civic club meeting at Cherryhurst,

19:16.102 --> 19:19.722
and it had to be 1030 at night, and there was still an

19:19.776 --> 19:22.986
employee there teaching one of the

19:23.008 --> 19:26.510
kids how to play chess so that he could be on the school team.

19:26.660 --> 19:30.350
And that dedication just changes lives.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.320
So thank you for that really quickly.

19:33.410 --> 19:36.830
Given the financial constraints that we continue to face

19:36.900 --> 19:40.334
at the city, what are some of the needs that currently are

19:40.372 --> 19:43.666
not being met, and is there anything you want to flag for council that may

19:43.688 --> 19:46.946
be coming up in the future that we need to be aware of as a

19:46.968 --> 19:50.214
need that is not sustainable right now. Based on this

19:50.252 --> 19:53.782
budget in terms

19:53.836 --> 19:57.302
of facility renovations and

19:57.356 --> 20:01.830
park maintenance and reducing our moore's cycles,

20:02.510 --> 20:06.090
we're currently on basically a 21 day

20:06.160 --> 20:10.042
cycle for much of the park land throughout the city.

20:10.176 --> 20:14.154
We do have some partnerships, and we're engaged with some community groups that

20:14.192 --> 20:17.486
help us take care of parks, but that's one of the major things. We want

20:17.508 --> 20:20.042
our parks in great condition,

20:20.186 --> 20:23.786
but currently, because of staffing levels and budget,

20:23.978 --> 20:26.662
we would love to reduce our mooring cycles.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.100
That's number one.

20:30.550 --> 20:34.420
And then two, in terms of delivering services,

20:35.430 --> 20:39.162
we're limited to the amount of staff that we have at each location.

20:39.326 --> 20:43.266
And so sometimes we're relocated to partnerships and opening

20:43.378 --> 20:47.346
and closing doors, with our primary programming

20:47.378 --> 20:50.866
being our after school program and then some specialty classes

20:50.898 --> 20:54.186
where we invite other groups to come in. So we

20:54.208 --> 20:58.134
have to do a lot of that, but mainly our Mourn

20:58.182 --> 21:02.294
cycles and then support for our youth

21:02.342 --> 21:06.250
in terms of programming, oh, I can't forget,

21:06.330 --> 21:09.678
and he'll kill me if I walk out of here without saying it.

21:09.844 --> 21:13.658
Our facilities in terms of upkeep

21:13.754 --> 21:17.322
and maintenance, we have some aging facilities.

21:17.466 --> 21:21.300
We need a lot, but we take care of them as best we can.

21:21.910 --> 21:25.358
Thank you. Like to welcome council member Sally

21:25.374 --> 21:28.574
Alcorn and Council member Carolyn Evan Chabaz to the horseshoe.

21:28.622 --> 21:31.814
Council Member Amy Pick. Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM.

21:31.852 --> 21:35.494
And thank you, Director for the presentation director. Has there ever

21:35.532 --> 21:38.854
been a study to see if for the

21:38.892 --> 21:42.474
Mowing of the Esplanades and the libraries and multi service centers, if working

21:42.512 --> 21:46.534
with Public Works to leverage funds or contracts,

21:46.582 --> 21:48.780
that kind of thing, would save any money?

21:50.110 --> 21:53.650
We certainly encourage collaborations

21:53.830 --> 21:56.670
and working together with other city departments,

21:57.490 --> 22:01.582
the Esplanades are very

22:01.636 --> 22:04.974
intense. We get to them like

22:05.012 --> 22:08.690
a third priority after we mow the parks

22:09.270 --> 22:14.686
and after we take care of other business. But that's

22:14.718 --> 22:18.100
a critical area because we want them to look as nice as everything else.

22:18.950 --> 22:21.320
As far as collaborating with Public Works,

22:22.410 --> 22:25.894
I think they're just as limited as we are. We do

22:25.932 --> 22:29.734
collaborate with neighborhood groups that want to maintain. That's been our

22:29.772 --> 22:33.494
best way to kind of dig into the inventory

22:33.542 --> 22:38.122
of espionage, but without partnering and us

22:38.176 --> 22:41.834
being a solo on it. 22 to 24

22:41.872 --> 22:45.726
days is what we are now based on resources. So we

22:45.748 --> 22:49.114
welcome collaboration with any department or neighborhood

22:49.162 --> 22:51.840
group to help us eat into that. Thank you.

22:52.850 --> 22:56.622
Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you.

22:56.676 --> 23:00.562
Along those same lines, on the performance measures in the budget book,

23:00.616 --> 23:04.526
you have actually a target of 27 days on the mowing cycle.

23:04.638 --> 23:08.434
And just back a couple of years ago, it was 21. And those

23:08.472 --> 23:11.778
six days make a heck of a lot of difference. So I'm also interested

23:11.864 --> 23:15.526
in, and I'm trying to find in

23:15.548 --> 23:18.806
the raw data, where can I find the

23:18.828 --> 23:22.786
mowing dollars? I mean, you have a landscape and gardening.

23:22.898 --> 23:26.262
Do you remember the name of how you classify

23:26.326 --> 23:30.026
mowing? It's not listed as mowing. Okay, you can get

23:30.048 --> 23:34.294
that to me later. We can get that specific. And on the health benefits question

23:34.352 --> 23:37.854
that Council member Cayman asked, I mean, I see consistently across all

23:37.892 --> 23:41.854
departments a big savings in

23:41.892 --> 23:45.566
health benefits. It's consistently over the years. And this is

23:45.588 --> 23:49.060
a 400 million plus expense we do every year.

23:52.550 --> 23:55.458
I know we want to have enough money for health benefits always,

23:55.624 --> 23:59.234
but we're overdoing it by quite a bit, and then those savings are

23:59.272 --> 24:02.710
passed back to the department. So that $103,000

24:02.780 --> 24:06.198
is just because we're overstating what we think we're going to need on health benefits.

24:06.284 --> 24:09.720
And I've seen that kind of across the board on that.

24:10.410 --> 24:15.030
Okay? That's all I have. If you could just get the exact mowing costs,

24:15.450 --> 24:18.694
I'd like to see that. And are they broken out by parks

24:18.742 --> 24:21.946
and libraries and Esplanades, or is

24:21.968 --> 24:23.180
it just kind of one?

24:25.150 --> 24:28.446
It's actually in one. So green space management. So if

24:28.468 --> 24:31.934
you look at the green space management budget, that's where you

24:31.972 --> 24:35.374
have it. So we don't have really anything broken down. Now, some of them

24:35.412 --> 24:38.302
have individual call centers, but not all parks have.

24:38.356 --> 24:41.678
Okay, so just in the green space management. And one thing I know we've

24:41.694 --> 24:44.340
talked to the city's naturalist about,

24:44.870 --> 24:48.302
and thanks to Barbara Quattro, in a leaf,

24:48.366 --> 24:51.458
she has brought up the linear forests,

24:51.554 --> 24:55.286
putting more trees in the Esplanades so the grass isn't growing so high.

24:55.388 --> 24:59.554
Also using more, we've had a big meeting with the natural

24:59.602 --> 25:02.934
plantings in the esplanades, which don't require

25:02.982 --> 25:07.142
as much mowing. So what is the department doing to further

25:07.206 --> 25:11.034
those initiatives? One thing, in terms of partnerships with

25:11.072 --> 25:14.602
neighborhoods and community groups, we have several of our

25:14.656 --> 25:18.270
Espanas that are maintained by neighborhoods. So that definitely

25:18.340 --> 25:22.142
help. They have to do it by park standard, of course,

25:22.196 --> 25:25.706
in terms of what you're planning and how you're maintaining. But that's

25:25.738 --> 25:29.314
been great over the years, and we hope to enhance that

25:29.352 --> 25:33.090
effort. Thank you, Council Member Robert Gallegos.

25:34.070 --> 25:37.730
Thank you, Chair. Talking about the esplanades as well.

25:37.880 --> 25:41.106
First of all, I think you all do a pretty good job with the number

25:41.128 --> 25:44.022
of esplanades you have in the city of Houston to try to keep all them

25:44.076 --> 25:47.446
maintained. But there are two or three

25:47.468 --> 25:51.198
esplanades over there by Gulf Gate. I know that the Pecan Park Civic

25:51.234 --> 25:54.954
Club has complained, and I believe

25:54.992 --> 25:57.530
it's because the esplanades are all concrete,

25:57.870 --> 26:01.398
but the cracks have grass that's growing that's like 2ft

26:01.414 --> 26:05.446
tall. So the civic

26:05.478 --> 26:08.254
club, PECOM Park has complained about that.

26:08.292 --> 26:12.126
So I'm hoping that can be addressed where they can go out.

26:12.228 --> 26:15.646
And again, I know they don't go out there regularly due to the fact

26:15.668 --> 26:19.466
that they're concreted over. It's not dirty

26:19.498 --> 26:22.834
and grass or what have you, but in between the cracks, the grass does

26:22.872 --> 26:26.766
grow and the grass kid you not. It's like 2ft tall.

26:26.958 --> 26:29.560
So if that can be addressed, it'd be great.

26:30.090 --> 26:33.686
Also, in regards to the golf special revenue fund or

26:33.708 --> 26:37.174
the golf expenses, I know that the

26:37.372 --> 26:40.934
Houston Golf Association took over Gus Worthham golf Course. It's still

26:40.972 --> 26:44.342
a city golf course, and this

26:44.396 --> 26:47.450
course was done back under the previous administration.

26:47.790 --> 26:51.386
And what I thought it was like a trial basis to see if they

26:51.408 --> 26:55.310
would be successful, and I think they've proven that they are successful.

26:55.730 --> 26:59.642
Is there still discussion of maybe the Houston Golf Association

26:59.786 --> 27:03.262
of taking over other city golf courses, even though

27:03.316 --> 27:07.234
it will be city land, city property, but they would just

27:07.352 --> 27:11.090
maintain it and manage it and what have you? No current

27:11.240 --> 27:15.090
discussion as far as golf association taking over golf courses

27:15.750 --> 27:19.774
with our involvement with the Astros Golf Foundation

27:19.822 --> 27:23.430
and the Astros primarily at Memorial Golf is doing

27:23.500 --> 27:27.090
great right now in terms of revenue. A lot of people are planning.

27:27.170 --> 27:30.114
We're able to maintain the courses appropriately,

27:30.242 --> 27:33.882
and then we do have Herman that's coming up pretty

27:33.936 --> 27:38.394
soon in terms of consideration of operating in

27:38.432 --> 27:42.026
November. So that may be on

27:42.048 --> 27:45.674
the table soon. Okay, you put me back in. We'll put you back.

27:45.712 --> 27:48.986
Include in queue council member Tasha Jackson.

27:49.178 --> 27:52.286
Thank you. And thank you, Director Allen, for your presentation and

27:52.308 --> 27:56.206
just all your work that you've been doing and working with my office on trying

27:56.228 --> 27:59.758
to get our parks. Just understand where we're going with

27:59.764 --> 28:03.346
the parks and the need. And I know we've done a lot of tours over

28:03.368 --> 28:06.686
the past two months, the parks in my district.

28:06.718 --> 28:09.614
And just talking to your staff, one of the things is we needed more staff.

28:09.662 --> 28:14.066
You need more staff to cover some of the maintenance that's

28:14.098 --> 28:18.482
needed within the parks. And so I'm just curious. I see that there's an increase

28:18.626 --> 28:21.874
of 10.3%. We have the love our parks

28:21.922 --> 28:25.158
initiative. So is the extra staff and the 5 million that's in the

28:25.164 --> 28:28.826
Love Our Parks, or have you included additional staff? I know

28:28.848 --> 28:31.786
our conversation was I know we need money, so we need to ask for what

28:31.808 --> 28:36.346
we need. I just want to make sure that we're aligned.

28:36.378 --> 28:40.442
And so is the additional staff in this budget. No additional

28:40.506 --> 28:44.286
staff, but just resources and material to get

28:44.308 --> 28:47.850
that type of work done and then outsourcing

28:48.010 --> 28:51.550
as we need to, especially with the Love Our Parks initiative.

28:51.710 --> 28:55.474
As we complete those projects. We have five more parks we're going

28:55.512 --> 28:59.480
to this fiscal year. We did five last year.

29:00.090 --> 29:03.590
But contracting out has been a way to complete

29:03.660 --> 29:07.074
some of the projects and then just the raw material

29:07.122 --> 29:10.454
that's needed for the upgrades, purchasing that.

29:10.572 --> 29:14.354
So one of the ways I operate is I do, like, a pento budget

29:14.402 --> 29:17.766
and like a Bentley budget. Like, what is your Bentley budget?

29:17.798 --> 29:21.562
Because I'm sure this is a pento budget. What is it that you actually need?

29:21.616 --> 29:25.626
I know my colleague asks those questions. What do you need to actually give

29:25.648 --> 29:29.254
the community what they need? And that's parks that's functionable that they can

29:29.392 --> 29:32.346
use. And so, of course, we've seen the parks in my district,

29:32.378 --> 29:35.566
and I know my other colleagues have visited the parks. And so what is it

29:35.588 --> 29:39.026
that you actually need to do your job? That's a

29:39.048 --> 29:42.738
load of questions for me. With Houston being the

29:42.744 --> 29:46.066
fourth largest city in a nation, we cover a

29:46.088 --> 29:49.906
lot of territory for us to get

29:49.928 --> 29:53.062
to 14 days or seven day

29:53.116 --> 29:56.966
mourning cycle. It's going to take a tremendous amount of money for

29:56.988 --> 30:00.470
us to get there. And then facility upgrades. When you think about

30:00.620 --> 30:04.598
we have agent facilities, agent pools, it's immense.

30:04.774 --> 30:08.140
I'll have to do a study or some type of

30:08.910 --> 30:12.154
document that would assess all of our

30:12.192 --> 30:15.594
facilities and then our programs, as well as things

30:15.632 --> 30:18.766
that we need to upgrade. But I'll need

30:18.788 --> 30:22.186
a little time to get that together for you. I don't want to just throw

30:22.218 --> 30:26.366
out a number, and it's not nearly what

30:26.388 --> 30:29.390
I need to tell you, but it's extensive. I will say that.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.386
Okay. And I'm still waiting on my list from the parks that we tour so

30:32.408 --> 30:36.050
I can get that dollar amount based upon what the community

30:36.120 --> 30:38.066
said that they would like to see in the park. And that way we can

30:38.088 --> 30:41.590
know what we need, and then we can advocate for those resources. And thank you.

30:41.660 --> 30:44.962
You're welcome. Council Member David Robinson.

30:45.026 --> 30:48.486
Thank you, chair and director. Thanks for everything you

30:48.508 --> 30:51.706
do with the limited budget I think some of the comments we're hearing from around

30:51.728 --> 30:55.274
the horseshoe just really underline how you

30:55.312 --> 30:58.906
do so much with so little. And while we're talking about

30:59.088 --> 31:03.146
things related to the request my council colleague just made,

31:03.328 --> 31:06.686
time and money and personnel would solve a lot of

31:06.708 --> 31:10.510
problems. So recognizing all that, I think

31:10.660 --> 31:13.806
you're coming here with your presentation on the heels of the

31:13.828 --> 31:16.946
discussion with the General Services Department. And some of

31:17.048 --> 31:20.754
what we spoke about already today was deferred maintenance. And as

31:20.792 --> 31:24.878
an observation, when one doesn't mow

31:25.054 --> 31:29.300
the esplanade, that deferred maintenance becomes very obvious.

31:29.750 --> 31:33.078
Witness my colleague, council Member Gallegos, with the problems

31:33.164 --> 31:36.502
down by Gulf Gate and hear the things that we're saying

31:36.556 --> 31:40.626
around town. So you hear from us all the time. In recognizing

31:40.658 --> 31:43.962
that, I want to appreciate what you're doing with

31:44.016 --> 31:47.414
limited dollars and all those special revenue

31:47.462 --> 31:50.746
funds and special projects that are piled one on

31:50.768 --> 31:54.842
top of the other. With our fast and wonderfully positive

31:54.906 --> 31:58.714
changing City Mayor Turner's Parks

31:58.762 --> 32:02.286
initiative, what we've done recently with celebrating the

32:02.308 --> 32:06.734
Zoo, some of our Bayou Greenways initiatives, of course,

32:06.852 --> 32:09.938
and with the golf program, to name a few.

32:10.024 --> 32:13.842
I want to focus on some of what we've described already today as

32:13.896 --> 32:17.262
master planning initiatives, whether that's the parks master

32:17.326 --> 32:21.486
plan, whether that's a master plan for tennis, which I appreciate.

32:21.598 --> 32:25.250
You've got a section in the appendix about other accomplishments

32:25.330 --> 32:28.834
where you talk about as you know, what we've been working on with the tennis

32:28.882 --> 32:32.186
program, and I just wondered if you can give a

32:32.208 --> 32:35.642
little narrative overtone of how

32:35.696 --> 32:39.366
you see things in that master planning

32:39.478 --> 32:42.086
category of our parks facilities.

32:42.198 --> 32:45.862
Because those, famously, as the Adage goes, a master

32:45.926 --> 32:48.954
plan tends to get on a shelf and collect dust.

32:49.082 --> 32:52.302
But what can we do to help you push forward?

32:52.436 --> 32:56.478
Specifically, in my case, curious about tennis, but what can we do as a

32:56.484 --> 33:00.082
council to support your good work? That's a great question,

33:00.216 --> 33:03.298
because when you think about the history of our park system,

33:03.464 --> 33:06.658
we've been through several different master plans and

33:06.744 --> 33:11.114
initiatives moving forward. I think collectively,

33:11.262 --> 33:14.850
if we look at all the directors in the other departments, one in Planning,

33:14.930 --> 33:18.230
of course, one with GSD Public Works,

33:18.380 --> 33:22.406
we're currently working together for the Love Our Parks initiative

33:22.598 --> 33:26.598
in several different areas. So from a citywide perspective,

33:26.694 --> 33:30.314
we look internally what we can do together for

33:30.352 --> 33:34.102
improvements. And then from a more broad

33:34.166 --> 33:38.074
perspective, we look at our partners, partners like Houston Parks

33:38.122 --> 33:41.690
Board, partners like the Buffalo Bayo Partnership,

33:41.850 --> 33:46.090
all of our partners, and then we look I think we have to look extensively

33:46.170 --> 33:49.262
past and beyond what we could do internally.

33:49.406 --> 33:52.130
And then from a study standpoint,

33:52.470 --> 33:55.314
we do our needs assessment, evaluate that,

33:55.432 --> 33:58.674
and then we just come together and figure out where the gaps are, and we

33:58.712 --> 34:02.406
redevelop the Parks master plan. I think

34:02.428 --> 34:04.454
our last plan was 2016,

34:04.492 --> 34:07.894
and we're currently trying to get to the point

34:07.932 --> 34:11.900
where we update that by 2024

34:12.430 --> 34:15.382
for our accreditation through NRPA.

34:15.526 --> 34:20.154
We need a solid master plan to

34:20.192 --> 34:23.626
present to receive our accreditation. So we'll be working on

34:23.648 --> 34:27.646
that aggressively in the next year. And the tennis program will

34:27.668 --> 34:31.200
be part of that, sir? Absolutely. Tennis has taken

34:32.050 --> 34:35.262
a unique, I would say,

34:35.316 --> 34:39.274
position right now because we invited prose

34:39.322 --> 34:42.866
consultant a few years ago to come in and do kind

34:42.888 --> 34:45.426
of a study on where we are and where we need to go. We have

34:45.448 --> 34:49.134
a draft document that we're tweaking now that we'll unleash

34:49.182 --> 34:53.106
with the help of zena Garrison who we hired as our tennis

34:53.218 --> 34:55.906
manager. There it is. Can you say that again out loud?

34:55.938 --> 34:59.974
There's the first time I've heard that. Zena Garrison we hired as

35:00.012 --> 35:03.590
our outreach and our manager for tennis.

35:03.750 --> 35:07.206
So she's coordinating with our new deputy assistant

35:07.238 --> 35:11.514
director, tom Angelos, who is in the room. We're going to work together

35:11.712 --> 35:14.300
on that plan and finalize it,

35:14.910 --> 35:18.558
which will also encompensate our master plan that we have to

35:18.644 --> 35:21.854
produce and

35:21.892 --> 35:25.342
submit to receive our accreditation by 24, I believe.

35:25.396 --> 35:29.038
Is that the right date? Yeah. Amazing. Well, you said Zena

35:29.054 --> 35:32.402
Garrison. I'm excited about that. Thank you for mentioning it. The other two words

35:32.456 --> 35:35.218
to say I think I just heard council member alcorn say it.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.860
Pickleball. Yeah.

35:41.510 --> 35:45.750
I'm going to challenge you all to try pickleball.

35:46.890 --> 35:51.030
We're planning on using the sport of pickleball.

35:51.630 --> 35:55.930
It's similar to tennis, and we're going to actually

35:56.000 --> 35:59.834
provide an opportunity for the public to play. We hope

35:59.872 --> 36:03.874
to establish about 30 courts throughout Houston combined

36:03.942 --> 36:06.750
with tennis. It's a unique sport.

36:07.410 --> 36:10.702
It's fast paced. There are several different

36:10.756 --> 36:14.234
division. Tom Angelos are newly hired.

36:14.282 --> 36:17.986
Well, he's been on for almost a year now. He's a

36:18.008 --> 36:22.690
pickleball advocate. And we're promoting not only developing courts

36:23.430 --> 36:27.074
with tennis, but also programming along the way.

36:27.272 --> 36:31.598
We're hosting the national pickleball tournament in October

36:31.694 --> 36:35.318
at memorial park. So when we get closer to that date, I would

36:35.324 --> 36:37.942
love for you guys to come out and take a look at it. Absolutely.

36:38.076 --> 36:41.378
Thanks again, director, you vice mayor pro TEM

36:41.404 --> 36:45.142
Martha castex Tatum. Thank you, chair director Allen,

36:45.206 --> 36:48.970
thank you so much for your presentation. I heard you say that

36:49.040 --> 36:53.546
esplanades were the third priority after

36:53.728 --> 36:57.326
the parks and some other services and then our esplanades. I was

36:57.348 --> 37:00.538
driving home on yesterday along Kirby.

37:00.714 --> 37:04.266
I usually go on 59, but I went down Kirby because the freeway is closed

37:04.298 --> 37:08.082
at 610 and I saw a group of contractors putting

37:08.136 --> 37:11.586
down turf in the esplanade, and I thought that

37:11.608 --> 37:15.010
was a genius idea. So my question is,

37:15.080 --> 37:19.006
what's your thoughts on turf in the esplanades?

37:19.118 --> 37:23.314
And I noticed that along that Kirby street

37:23.442 --> 37:26.726
headed towards holcomb, there are lots of trees, so the

37:26.748 --> 37:30.674
grass doesn't grow there. So I know they were putting that artificial

37:30.722 --> 37:35.110
turf down because they can't get the grass to grow there. But it looked amazing.

37:35.260 --> 37:38.266
I said I was going to go back down that way today to see what

37:38.288 --> 37:41.338
the. Finished product looked like, but there was a whole crew there,

37:41.424 --> 37:44.810
and they were putting down turf in the esplanade.

37:44.890 --> 37:48.526
I'm interested to know your thoughts on that, because if that's a

37:48.548 --> 37:51.982
thing, I'd be interested in having

37:52.036 --> 37:55.920
some artificial turf and some espionage in District A.

37:56.850 --> 38:00.062
That's a pretty amazing idea. We have some wonderful partnerships

38:00.126 --> 38:03.698
with neighborhoods in terms of taking care of

38:03.784 --> 38:07.646
their espinates. It's called the adopt Espinate

38:07.678 --> 38:11.630
program. And so there's some great ideas. Turf is very expensive

38:11.710 --> 38:14.902
to put down up front, but you don't have to maintain it.

38:14.956 --> 38:18.326
So I like to explore that idea even more. I'll go

38:18.348 --> 38:21.298
by there today and take a picture of the finished product and send it to

38:21.324 --> 38:24.522
you, and we can explore that a little more. I'll appreciate it.

38:24.576 --> 38:27.770
All right. Council Member Carolyn Evans Shabaz.

38:30.750 --> 38:34.234
Thank you, Mayor Pro. Tim. Thank you so much. Director Allen.

38:34.282 --> 38:38.026
We've had a lot of engagement about our park

38:38.058 --> 38:41.038
rich, District D. I wanted to ask,

38:41.204 --> 38:44.480
how often are the esplanades cut?

38:44.850 --> 38:48.046
I just got a call, and they're saying that they think

38:48.068 --> 38:51.582
they need to be cut every two weeks. I don't know what kind of cycle

38:51.726 --> 38:55.650
they are on, and maybe it depends on where they're located.

38:56.390 --> 38:59.742
We're actually on a 28 day cycle for espionage,

38:59.806 --> 39:03.586
but I think every two weeks is a little much to

39:03.608 --> 39:06.882
be able to maintain for a full city. So I was just curious.

39:06.946 --> 39:10.134
So it's a 28 day cycle, at least 28 days. But many

39:10.172 --> 39:14.182
of our espionage are adopted by civic clubs and neighborhood

39:14.246 --> 39:17.894
groups, and so that's been great. In some areas.

39:18.022 --> 39:21.734
It's kind of like having a garden and having volunteers

39:21.782 --> 39:25.146
kind of maintain it. We do have standards, and there's a process

39:25.248 --> 39:28.714
for adopting an espinate. I encourage communities

39:28.762 --> 39:32.746
to get involved with that. It's certainly a way to keep neighborhoods

39:32.778 --> 39:36.350
beautified. In terms of volunteerism,

39:36.690 --> 39:40.482
my last question, how do the sectors factor in

39:40.616 --> 39:44.142
to money? Because I know that we have a lot of parks,

39:44.206 --> 39:47.490
but we don't get as much money in regards to the sectors.

39:48.570 --> 39:52.386
The park sectors are specific to the development that's

39:52.418 --> 39:56.214
happening in those sectors, and monies are allotted to that

39:56.252 --> 39:59.282
specific sector. I've had recent conversations

39:59.346 --> 40:03.414
with legal about how we can possibly

40:03.542 --> 40:07.258
even the playing field in terms of

40:07.424 --> 40:10.874
money and development throughout this city. We are looking

40:10.912 --> 40:14.794
at some potential options that we could get into in terms

40:14.832 --> 40:18.014
of sharing in the future. But I don't have a document for you guys just

40:18.052 --> 40:21.166
yet, but we're looking into that. Okay, thank you very much.

40:21.268 --> 40:24.350
Thank you. Council Member Mary NAN Huffman.

40:24.930 --> 40:28.434
Thank you, Director, for everything that you do. How many escalades are

40:28.472 --> 40:29.860
adopted, do you know?

40:32.710 --> 40:34.290
Mr. Gonzalez?

40:38.470 --> 40:41.666
About 1000 acres. Okay. And you've talked about the

40:41.688 --> 40:43.880
program, the Adopt an Esplanade program,

40:45.050 --> 40:47.894
but I don't see a lot of advertising for it. What do we do to

40:47.932 --> 40:52.054
encourage civic associations and homeowners associations to engage

40:52.102 --> 40:56.250
in that program? Oh, definitely, if you guys have newsletters,

40:56.830 --> 40:59.660
put them in your newsletters online,

41:00.590 --> 41:03.654
and we can develop a campaign to actually assist

41:03.702 --> 41:07.278
with that from our communications office. But I think

41:07.284 --> 41:10.574
it's a great idea to get more exposure toward that program.

41:10.772 --> 41:14.778
And then also, if one esplanade is adopted,

41:14.954 --> 41:17.906
what does that equal in savings for the city?

41:18.088 --> 41:22.030
Or is it by acre? Oh, our expense

41:22.110 --> 41:25.682
per acre is about mr.

41:25.736 --> 41:34.198
Gonzalez 2828

41:34.284 --> 41:38.360
$2800 per acre. Thank you.

41:39.850 --> 41:41.910
Council Member Robert Gallegos.

41:43.210 --> 41:46.920
Thank you, Mayor, for Tim. Director, in regards to I know there's a

41:47.530 --> 41:51.194
y'all are in need of lifeguards. I am so

41:51.232 --> 41:55.120
glad you brought that up. Are we

41:55.650 --> 41:58.926
we have 37 pools throughout this city,

41:59.028 --> 42:02.174
and I would love to open all of them. You guys know

42:02.212 --> 42:04.080
last year we only opened ten.

42:05.170 --> 42:08.754
This year, we're scheduled to do just

42:08.792 --> 42:12.546
about that. Again, there's just a shortage. We don't have

42:12.568 --> 42:16.434
the same amount of

42:16.552 --> 42:19.670
young men and women coming out to lifeguard.

42:20.890 --> 42:24.038
They're choosing other things. Our workforce used to

42:24.044 --> 42:28.310
be about 50% return, but after we closed pools,

42:28.810 --> 42:32.774
we lost that workforce, and we're aggressively trying to regain

42:32.822 --> 42:36.954
it. But for a young

42:36.992 --> 42:40.874
adult starting at 16, we have

42:40.912 --> 42:44.714
opportunities anywhere from a pool supervisor to a head

42:44.752 --> 42:48.622
lifeguard and a lifeguard. And we take this profession very

42:48.676 --> 42:52.670
seriously because you're responsible for lives in that pool.

42:53.010 --> 42:56.546
We want to operate safely, and we want to make sure we have everything we

42:56.568 --> 42:59.906
need at each location. So if we were to open a

42:59.928 --> 43:03.342
day, it would be about ten or eleven pools.

43:03.406 --> 43:08.706
We're aggressively recruiting and asking for help so

43:08.728 --> 43:11.894
that we can open more. And we'll do that from a

43:12.012 --> 43:15.830
strategic standpoint. In terms of attendance in the past,

43:15.980 --> 43:19.878
we may go to a rotating schedule. Two pools open

43:20.044 --> 43:24.166
on this side of town or in this district, and then maybe Tuesday,

43:24.278 --> 43:28.054
Thursday, and then two on another side, maybe Wednesday,

43:28.102 --> 43:31.466
Friday. But we have to get creative in providing these services

43:31.568 --> 43:35.254
across the city with what we have in terms of staffing resources.

43:35.302 --> 43:39.086
But we're aggressively recruiting right now, and I'm hoping you reach out

43:39.108 --> 43:42.334
to the District council members so that way we can have input as to what

43:42.372 --> 43:45.982
pools we think should be opened. I know Clinton Park has already

43:46.036 --> 43:49.534
reached out to me, and there's no other pool in the area,

43:49.732 --> 43:53.186
so I think Clinton Park would be a great pool to open in

43:53.208 --> 43:56.420
District I. And my last question here,

43:56.950 --> 44:01.798
looking at the demographic breakdown again,

44:01.964 --> 44:05.640
with nearly half the population being Hispanic, only 29%

44:06.330 --> 44:09.970
are employed by the Parks Department are Hispanic.

44:10.130 --> 44:13.322
So I'm hoping that there can be some improvement on that.

44:13.456 --> 44:16.682
And if you could also please provide me with a breakdown of the

44:16.816 --> 44:20.954
demographic breakdown for the management of

44:20.992 --> 44:23.100
the Parks Department, I would appreciate it.

44:24.030 --> 44:26.858
Thank you. Certainly. Council member Abby Cayman.

44:27.034 --> 44:30.170
Thank you, Mayor. Pro TEM. Really quickly, director,

44:30.250 --> 44:33.534
one thing that's been on my mind here in Houston we talk a lot about

44:33.572 --> 44:36.882
flooding, as we should, but we also

44:37.016 --> 44:40.418
have cyclical droughts. 87% of

44:40.424 --> 44:44.226
the state right now, and I think over half of Houston itself is actually in

44:44.248 --> 44:49.278
a drought. Are those costs calculated

44:49.374 --> 44:52.806
in, or how much more cost is it when we're dealing with

44:52.828 --> 44:55.320
a drought? So having to water more?

44:56.490 --> 45:00.514
Again, 2011 cost millions of dollars in Memorial

45:00.562 --> 45:04.154
Park alone from the loss of trees. So if you could just speak

45:04.192 --> 45:07.370
to that really quickly in terms of that cost calculation.

45:07.950 --> 45:12.410
As far as the cost breakdown, I don't have any history from

45:12.480 --> 45:15.790
previous droughts. I just know we had to recover.

45:16.290 --> 45:19.854
We had to do specific things in terms of soil, in terms

45:19.892 --> 45:24.718
of plants, in terms of placement, but I

45:24.724 --> 45:29.300
don't have any data that could support it at this point. I could certainly do

45:29.670 --> 45:33.090
a little bit of research with our green space team and

45:33.240 --> 45:36.930
get you something specific, no problem. And then lastly,

45:37.350 --> 45:41.670
council member Robinson, I think me and director Allen could definitely

45:41.820 --> 45:45.106
take you and council member Alcorn on in a doubles

45:45.138 --> 45:48.374
with pickleball. So let us know whenever you want. We'll be

45:48.412 --> 45:50.840
there. What time is session over with?

45:52.890 --> 45:56.410
Thank you. Anytime you guys would like to, just let me know.

45:56.560 --> 46:00.598
We have five public speakers. Before that, I'd like to go to slide

46:00.774 --> 46:04.380
eight that's on the list. And it's about Memorial Park Golf Course.

46:04.750 --> 46:08.470
I had the opportunity to play Saturday. I went there for the beginning of the

46:08.480 --> 46:11.722
first tea event they had over there. And I just wanted to highlight

46:11.786 --> 46:15.502
we get 1.1 million $333,000

46:15.556 --> 46:18.974
as a gift from the Astros Foundation. I love the fact that

46:19.012 --> 46:23.074
you all aerated and put some sand all over the course. And we really need

46:23.112 --> 46:26.542
to have that course, as you know, in great shape in November

46:26.606 --> 46:29.714
for the tournament, because if you remember last

46:29.752 --> 46:33.158
year, it wasn't in good shape. And there was a quote in a Sunday paper

46:33.244 --> 46:36.502
that when we all picked it up and reread it, we were embarrassed by it,

46:36.556 --> 46:39.814
and that was the winner of the tournament. Jason Cocrot was

46:39.852 --> 46:43.830
quoted as saying, I would have shot seven shots better

46:43.980 --> 46:47.562
if I wasn't hitting off of mud all day. So as

46:47.616 --> 46:51.546
Memorial Park golf Course, so goes the rest of the golf courses in

46:51.568 --> 46:55.270
the city because we use the proceeds and we fund a lot of our operations

46:55.350 --> 46:58.766
with that. So I see a lot of good work out there. So thank you

46:58.788 --> 47:02.394
for that. Director. One thing that I did talk to Ms. Julie Blum

47:02.442 --> 47:05.726
about is summer jobs program. Texas A

47:05.748 --> 47:09.118
and M has a great golf turf management school.

47:09.284 --> 47:12.594
Have we reached out to them, or does it make sense that we do reach

47:12.632 --> 47:16.066
out to them and try and get some of those young kids that

47:16.088 --> 47:20.114
are studying turf grass science and come to Memorial

47:20.162 --> 47:23.446
and spend a summer? It look good on their

47:23.468 --> 47:27.366
resume that they worked on a PGA tournament golf course.

47:27.468 --> 47:30.870
And I think we have hard time attracting

47:31.770 --> 47:34.726
employees out there right now because we just don't,

47:34.838 --> 47:38.310
quite frankly, pay enough. And they get other opportunities

47:38.390 --> 47:42.166
at other golf courses all around the city. So we're disadvantaged

47:42.198 --> 47:45.646
right there. But using some of those Texas A and M kids, I think

47:45.668 --> 47:48.718
would make a good sense to get that course ready,

47:48.804 --> 47:52.270
because the growing season is upon us,

47:52.340 --> 47:55.230
and if we don't have it ready in November,

47:55.730 --> 47:58.874
the Houston Open will not be at Memorial Park.

47:58.922 --> 48:02.254
Again, my opinion and many other people's opinions.

48:02.302 --> 48:05.666
So we're doing a great job of trying to get it there, but I want

48:05.688 --> 48:09.246
to raise that warning flag and say we have to nail

48:09.278 --> 48:12.614
it in November. If we do nail it, we get

48:12.652 --> 48:16.242
an opportunity, a golden opportunity, to move it to April.

48:16.386 --> 48:19.746
And what happens in April, we don't compete against football.

48:19.858 --> 48:23.610
We don't compete against basketball, and we don't compete against

48:23.680 --> 48:26.822
baseball. And our attendance numbers will zoom,

48:26.966 --> 48:30.934
and the higher they go, the more money we will receive from the Astros Golf

48:30.982 --> 48:34.480
Foundation. So any comments on that?

48:35.810 --> 48:39.406
Last year was unfortunate in terms of some

48:39.428 --> 48:42.942
of the results of maintenance of the course, I believe

48:42.996 --> 48:46.690
we made those adjustments to move forward. We're currently

48:46.760 --> 48:50.594
looking for a senior superintendent that we're working

48:50.632 --> 48:53.794
with, the Astros Golf Foundation as well

48:53.832 --> 48:57.602
as a PGA. I think we have qualified and great

48:57.736 --> 49:01.042
staff there. Now in terms of maintenance

49:01.106 --> 49:04.966
of the course, we won't have the issues that we had last year with the

49:04.988 --> 49:08.806
Greens and their approach shots. Major focus.

49:08.988 --> 49:12.422
If you see the Agronomy plan that we're working on now,

49:12.476 --> 49:15.862
you can already see improvements. So I'm confident

49:15.926 --> 49:19.882
that we will meet the standard that we need to meet this year because

49:19.936 --> 49:23.306
we're making adjustments accordingly, and I know you will. So thank you for

49:23.328 --> 49:25.530
that. Council Member Carolyn Evan Shabaz.

49:27.150 --> 49:30.334
Thank you, Mayor. For. Tim and I did want to take this time to tell

49:30.372 --> 49:33.898
you thank you as well. We had our first Te graduation

49:33.994 --> 49:38.386
on this past Saturday. It was great. We had 16 students

49:38.488 --> 49:42.802
that participated in a program for a few weeks, and you

49:42.856 --> 49:46.126
were the impetus for that idea, you and Steven,

49:46.238 --> 49:49.826
my constituents director. The young people really

49:49.928 --> 49:53.766
enjoyed it, and more importantly, they have opportunities to maintain the

49:53.788 --> 49:57.154
game and perhaps get scholarships. And so that's

49:57.202 --> 50:00.726
so very important. So I wanted to make sure that I did thank you

50:00.748 --> 50:04.474
for that. Thank you. We have five

50:04.512 --> 50:07.450
public speakers. Same rules apply for this session as last.

50:07.520 --> 50:11.814
First we'll have Miss Saba blinding Director.

50:11.942 --> 50:15.680
Thank you for your comments, and I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

50:18.450 --> 50:22.206
Hello. Good morning. First. Before I forget, I wanted to

50:22.388 --> 50:26.042
follow on Council member Alcorn and Council member Cayman's comments

50:26.106 --> 50:29.214
about drought. And I love the idea of putting some more native

50:29.262 --> 50:32.830
grasses and native plants in our esplanades, in our cross

50:32.910 --> 50:34.900
just to help.

50:36.550 --> 50:40.386
And also, I wanted to speak on behalf of my ten year old, who could

50:40.408 --> 50:44.374
not be here this morning due to testing. She would love to see

50:44.412 --> 50:47.746
more skate parks in the city of Houston. She is a great fan

50:47.778 --> 50:51.542
of the Lee and Joe Jamel skate park as well as the lessons you offer

50:51.596 --> 50:55.066
through them. And she also shared a desire for more gardens like the

50:55.088 --> 50:58.726
McGovern Centennial Gardens. She also asked about sidebalks

50:58.758 --> 51:01.050
and I told her that was a whole nother bag.

51:02.590 --> 51:05.958
And just as a mom, I cannot say

51:05.984 --> 51:09.530
enough good things about the Parks Department. I frequently have conversations

51:09.610 --> 51:13.610
with other parents discussing both of our love for Houston

51:13.690 --> 51:17.054
parks programming and a desire for more as they quickly fill up once

51:17.092 --> 51:20.334
open to the public. Just a quick anecdote.

51:20.382 --> 51:24.078
A friend of mine once shared the long list of incredible Houston camps

51:24.094 --> 51:27.774
his sons attended and that of all of them, the Cherryhurst

51:27.822 --> 51:31.026
camp through the Parks Department was their favorite. And they liked it so much that

51:31.048 --> 51:33.640
the next summer it was the only program they signed up for.

51:34.330 --> 51:36.838
And I could say more and more about what parents talk about. Thank you,

51:36.844 --> 51:40.680
Ms. Blanding. Thank you. We're running behind already.

51:41.290 --> 51:45.446
Could I just a quick question. 5 seconds. Okay, thinking citywide.

51:45.558 --> 51:49.590
What would it look like to expand and grow current programming equitably

51:49.670 --> 51:53.706
across the city? So thank you for the question and

51:53.888 --> 51:57.486
we are directing director Allen and Ms. Johnson that

51:57.508 --> 52:00.686
we will field all the questions. So we will go ahead and

52:00.708 --> 52:04.698
take that. If anybody has any answers to Ms.

52:04.714 --> 52:08.126
Blanding's question on council, please feel free to

52:08.148 --> 52:11.506
chime in. But as a good teacher would say,

52:11.528 --> 52:14.978
you're dismissed. I just want to know what it would

52:14.984 --> 52:18.386
be look like. I mean, I can't say enough good things about the programming and

52:18.408 --> 52:22.338
so what would it look like to expand it more equitably

52:22.434 --> 52:26.200
across the city of Houston? Getting tongue tied today.

52:27.130 --> 52:30.374
I mean, funds are limited. I'll give you an example. We have no city run

52:30.412 --> 52:33.926
parks in Kingwood, and we have one city run park in Clear Lake.

52:33.958 --> 52:37.654
So I have one. And we have Lake

52:37.702 --> 52:40.870
Houston Wilderness Park, which is the most underappreciated

52:40.950 --> 52:43.930
park in the city, maybe in the south,

52:44.350 --> 52:47.534
but I think that a lot of it comes

52:47.572 --> 52:50.926
from you all. South in the US. I think

52:50.948 --> 52:54.586
a lot of it comes from you all based on the dynamics and the circumstances

52:54.618 --> 52:58.346
of each district, understanding what the needs are of each neighborhood

52:58.378 --> 53:01.378
and what you would like to see from a programming standpoint as well as a

53:01.384 --> 53:04.626
recreational standpoint. And so we

53:04.648 --> 53:07.890
lean on you all to let us know as your council members

53:07.960 --> 53:11.366
on what you would like to see within your own footprint. And then we will

53:11.388 --> 53:15.126
work within ourselves, either through our council district service funds or directly with

53:15.148 --> 53:18.406
the Parks Department on trying to find ways to

53:18.428 --> 53:22.006
improve parks with those specialty needs. Yes, and if you

53:22.028 --> 53:25.094
have any ideas, please send them to us. We will make sure that we pass

53:25.132 --> 53:28.074
them along and then we will give them to your appropriate council member as well.

53:28.112 --> 53:31.334
Because as we keep talking about, we do have council district

53:31.382 --> 53:35.642
service funds that we can use for some of our parks activities.

53:35.706 --> 53:39.022
I know we use some at our Sylvan Rodriguez Park down

53:39.076 --> 53:41.726
south. I appreciate the invitation. Yes,

53:41.748 --> 53:45.866
ma'am. Mr. Council Member Robert Gallegos.

53:45.898 --> 53:46.640
I'm sorry.

53:49.110 --> 53:52.530
First of all, thank you for being here. Appreciate you being here.

53:52.600 --> 53:56.562
I know that Mayor Turner has the 50

53:56.616 --> 54:00.066
50 parks. He's reaching out to corporations to

54:00.088 --> 54:03.730
hopefully put some monies in parks that have been neglected

54:03.810 --> 54:06.918
in many of our districts. I know that at

54:07.004 --> 54:10.754
Hartman Park there in Manchester, we were able to get valero.

54:10.802 --> 54:14.322
That was the first 50 50 park. They were able to put monies for

54:14.396 --> 54:17.526
new play equipment because I kid you not, some of their play, the play equipment

54:17.558 --> 54:21.066
was rusting. And a lot

54:21.088 --> 54:24.170
of people are surprised on the cost of play equipment.

54:24.670 --> 54:27.820
It was about $660,000

54:28.350 --> 54:32.058
for new play equipment at at Hartman Park. So that that's

54:32.074 --> 54:35.390
what we're running into is that the cost is just so expensive.

54:36.210 --> 54:40.018
And I've got a request at Fondi Park last week at my

54:40.104 --> 54:43.806
redistricting that they're just looking for new swings.

54:43.918 --> 54:46.946
I asked them, do you need the whole play equipment? They said, no, we just

54:46.968 --> 54:50.882
need new swings. So I'm going to put in the cost to the

54:50.936 --> 54:53.974
parks department to see just how much do swings cost.

54:54.092 --> 54:57.282
And I'm afraid to hear the price tag just for swings,

54:57.346 --> 55:01.078
but I'm going to try to do that at Fondue Park as

55:01.084 --> 55:04.234
well. Thank you, Mr. Landing. Thank you,

55:04.352 --> 55:06.460
Mr. Jason Oliver. Thank you.

55:19.160 --> 55:22.192
So I just got here late during the last presentation,

55:22.256 --> 55:26.272
but I wanted to ask, why is council

55:26.336 --> 55:29.816
fielding our questions instead of the because every committee I let

55:29.838 --> 55:32.932
it get away. That was my fault. I let it get away from us yesterday.

55:32.996 --> 55:36.316
That's why we ran overtime. We're going to limit people to 1 minute like we

55:36.338 --> 55:39.804
gave instructions on. And in every committee meeting we have in the city

55:39.842 --> 55:43.740
of Houston, questions come to council members, not to

55:43.810 --> 55:47.036
department directors. So we're going to keep with

55:47.058 --> 55:50.016
that as elected officials. That's on us.

55:50.118 --> 55:53.808
It's our budget process as well. So we're going to

55:53.814 --> 55:57.280
go back to what I should have done yesterday and that was my fault.

55:58.020 --> 56:01.984
So we won't be able to likely get the

56:02.022 --> 56:06.004
answers to our questions or at least clear answers in time for the well,

56:06.122 --> 56:09.812
hopefully you all can get answers back quickly. Yes. I mean, our path is within

56:09.866 --> 56:13.344
48 hours, we get the questions posted, we get the answers.

56:13.392 --> 56:17.236
And I would invite you to talk to your respective council member

56:17.348 --> 56:20.984
and make sure you get those answers to those questions directed back

56:21.022 --> 56:24.484
to you. Okay. In the past, the parks

56:24.532 --> 56:27.956
department has said that they can easily double you soccer participation

56:28.068 --> 56:31.372
with just a few more staff to administer the program. Your general

56:31.426 --> 56:35.004
fund spend is about 200,000. Basically the same as five years ago.

56:35.122 --> 56:38.670
Is there an opportunity to still reach an additional 50,000 students

56:39.540 --> 56:42.704
through that programming? And I also want to know how competitive lifeguard pay

56:42.742 --> 56:46.304
is. So I'll take our lifeguard pay.

56:46.502 --> 56:49.852
That's why we're having trouble right now. Is it's not competitive,

56:49.916 --> 56:53.444
especially with some of the different swim clubs that we have

56:53.482 --> 56:58.084
around that pay a little bit more than we do. So you

56:58.122 --> 57:01.764
answer your question. It's not competitive enough to

57:01.802 --> 57:05.208
answer your question. I think it was about soccer. Yeah, a lot of the

57:05.214 --> 57:07.896
soccer fields in the city of what's that?

57:07.998 --> 57:11.448
$11 an hour? A lot

57:11.454 --> 57:14.410
of the soccer fields I'm a soccer dad. All three of my kids,

57:18.940 --> 57:21.850
13 to 16, is the official answer.

57:23.600 --> 57:26.876
Director Allen competitive? Correct me if I'm wrong. Your question is

57:26.898 --> 57:30.096
about soccer fields. A lot of our soccer fields are leased to a lot

57:30.118 --> 57:34.176
of these soccer organizations, and we monitor the activity on them.

57:34.198 --> 57:38.368
So if they're leased, they actually control the soccer fields like

57:38.534 --> 57:42.544
the Houston Golf Association controls Gus Worthham

57:42.592 --> 57:46.180
Park. So it's up to those folks to decide. Oh, no,

57:46.330 --> 57:49.572
my question was because the soccer program is

57:49.626 --> 57:55.096
grant funded, and in the past they've said that they

57:55.118 --> 57:59.300
could double the participation with more General Fund dollars for administration.

57:59.380 --> 58:03.028
The the limitation is, is General Fund spend on administration,

58:03.124 --> 58:06.056
not for. So that could easily ramp up.

58:06.078 --> 58:09.836
I'm trying to figure out if that's still the case, if we still are kind

58:09.858 --> 58:13.260
of leaving students out when we could allocate another

58:13.330 --> 58:17.492
quick 200,000 to really ramp up our soccer

58:17.656 --> 58:21.344
participation for children in Houston. Right. And thank you.

58:21.462 --> 58:24.640
We will post that question and get that question answered.

58:31.720 --> 58:33.220
Lauren Johnson.

58:38.440 --> 58:41.908
Hi. So the after school

58:42.074 --> 58:45.448
enrichment program currently operates at 51 community

58:45.534 --> 58:48.824
centers locations throughout the Houston area, and they

58:48.862 --> 58:53.370
service about 2500 youth with a ratio of 1.25.

58:54.300 --> 58:58.312
So where is that in terms of adequate or optimal staffing?

58:58.376 --> 59:02.316
And how could we strategically fund that expansion in the

59:02.338 --> 59:05.756
short term? Anyone want

59:05.778 --> 59:06.990
to take this one on?

59:11.620 --> 59:14.876
Okay, we will get that answer posted. And I would invite

59:14.908 --> 59:18.416
you to get in touch with your council member for the

59:18.518 --> 59:21.916
answer to that question. Once again,

59:21.958 --> 59:25.088
public speakers should submit their questions in writing,

59:25.264 --> 59:28.580
and then we will get in writing a written response back to you within

59:28.650 --> 59:32.576
48 hours to your particular district

59:32.608 --> 59:34.330
council member or at large.

59:36.620 --> 59:48.734
Joe Grochell so

59:48.772 --> 59:52.830
my question is, the Parks Department seems to be on par with the libraries

59:52.910 --> 59:56.110
in its significant community reach and impact.

59:56.270 --> 1:00:00.206
And how many Houstonians do you think you are able to serve

1:00:00.238 --> 1:00:01.570
with every dollar?

1:00:04.230 --> 1:00:08.646
Apparently not enough parks are I

1:00:08.668 --> 1:00:12.326
told you about my experience. We have no Houston parks in the area that I

1:00:12.348 --> 1:00:15.606
live in. We have one Houston park in the area that is

1:00:15.708 --> 1:00:18.874
Clear Lake, and there's a great deal of

1:00:18.912 --> 1:00:22.106
demand. Fortunately, we have good county parks in both

1:00:22.128 --> 1:00:25.958
of those areas that we partner with in many, many ways county

1:00:25.974 --> 1:00:29.530
has done a fantastic job. My opinion of

1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:33.610
building parks in and around the city of Houston, in the ETJ

1:00:33.690 --> 1:00:37.486
areas, the city of Houston, we struggle a

1:00:37.508 --> 1:00:40.638
little bit because of the lack of funds that we have available,

1:00:40.804 --> 1:00:44.546
but we do the best job that we can given the fact that the

1:00:44.568 --> 1:00:47.922
funds are not as plentiful as they should be.

1:00:48.056 --> 1:00:51.054
And if anyone wants to make a foundation donation,

1:00:51.182 --> 1:00:54.786
I would contact the great number of foundations we have in and around the city

1:00:54.888 --> 1:00:58.358
that are very philanthropic with their efforts, and contact

1:00:58.444 --> 1:01:02.306
them and adopt a neighborhood program to adopt a neighborhood park.

1:01:02.418 --> 1:01:06.082
We've done that in the area that I live in. We're responsible

1:01:06.146 --> 1:01:09.574
for the mowing of the grass, the new soccer equipment,

1:01:09.622 --> 1:01:12.986
and we even had a fundraiser for the lights that we put up. Now,

1:01:13.088 --> 1:01:16.410
not every community has the ability to do that.

1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:20.726
I get it. But I think philanthropic areas

1:01:20.838 --> 1:01:24.506
of funding, we have a great number of folks

1:01:24.538 --> 1:01:28.442
in and around this Houston area. I'll throw out the Brown

1:01:28.506 --> 1:01:31.630
Foundation. That has been very good to us in many regards.

1:01:34.390 --> 1:01:35.300
Thank you.

1:01:36.950 --> 1:01:38.610
Melissa Martinez.

1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:55.524
Hello. Hi. So I have a couple of

1:01:55.562 --> 1:01:58.912
questions. My questions about accessibility,

1:01:59.056 --> 1:02:02.676
such as how have the needs have changed for youth

1:02:02.708 --> 1:02:06.088
and elders programming during the Pandemic and also

1:02:06.174 --> 1:02:09.492
for our disability communities?

1:02:09.556 --> 1:02:13.012
And how do staff and support needed to support these equitable

1:02:13.076 --> 1:02:16.590
access to these programs? And also

1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:21.336
mentioned in slide 27 in the budget, I noticed

1:02:21.368 --> 1:02:25.144
that there was an investment of 14 million and improved 18 neighborhoods,

1:02:25.192 --> 1:02:29.016
parks, and community centers. What would the impacts be if budgets

1:02:29.048 --> 1:02:33.052
were to be doubled, say, like 28 million to help with these accessibility?

1:02:33.116 --> 1:02:36.624
I think the Mayor's 50 50 initiative is right on target with

1:02:36.662 --> 1:02:39.692
exactly what you're doing, especially in complete communities.

1:02:39.756 --> 1:02:43.284
That's been our emphasis. Community is only as good

1:02:43.322 --> 1:02:46.964
as the parks around it, and giving young people the

1:02:47.002 --> 1:02:50.132
opportunity to participate with funding of nice

1:02:50.186 --> 1:02:54.004
parks is one of the initiatives that we're front and

1:02:54.042 --> 1:02:57.576
center with what we're trying to do. Council Member David Robinson. Thank you. I just

1:02:57.598 --> 1:03:00.872
wanted to mention to Ms. Martinez that our Director of the Mayor's Office

1:03:00.926 --> 1:03:04.836
for Persons with Disabilities, Gabe Cassidas, recently presented

1:03:04.868 --> 1:03:08.412
to the TTI committee that we chair. And that presentation did talk

1:03:08.466 --> 1:03:12.812
about accessibility generally, but also within

1:03:12.866 --> 1:03:17.228
the context of parks access. So you may find that posted on the city website

1:03:17.314 --> 1:03:20.608
under the TTI committee heading, and I

1:03:20.614 --> 1:03:23.360
think you might find that helpful considering your question.

1:03:23.510 --> 1:03:27.740
Okay. I know Director Allen. We made a lot of adjustments during the Pandemic.

1:03:27.820 --> 1:03:31.570
We took the basketball goals down. We did a lot of things.

1:03:31.940 --> 1:03:35.140
If I made the statement that we're pretty close to where we were

1:03:35.210 --> 1:03:38.020
pre Pandemic, is that accurate? Yes.

1:03:38.170 --> 1:03:41.492
Okay. So I think you'll see more and more of that where,

1:03:41.546 --> 1:03:44.904
especially when the summer rolls through, hopefully we can get the lifeguards out.

1:03:44.942 --> 1:03:48.680
It's going to be a hot summer. It's going to be a dry summer.

1:03:49.820 --> 1:03:53.208
It was funny because many of us went to

1:03:53.214 --> 1:03:57.160
a Houston prayer breakfast this morning. I know many of our officers did as well.

1:03:57.310 --> 1:04:00.344
And Mr. Herzog from one of the TV stations was

1:04:00.382 --> 1:04:03.496
talking about the drought and the conditions and how he hates it. And I was

1:04:03.518 --> 1:04:07.088
the only one that actually love a drought because love in a

1:04:07.094 --> 1:04:10.464
drought means we have no storms coming yet and

1:04:10.502 --> 1:04:13.680
we need to be prepared because the area that I live in was

1:04:13.750 --> 1:04:17.676
pretty devastated, as is council member Jackson's.

1:04:17.708 --> 1:04:20.940
But Abby came and shaking her head, no, but I love droughts.

1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:23.260
Difference of opinion. Thank you. We will now transition.
