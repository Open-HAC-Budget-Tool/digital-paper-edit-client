1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,546
My name is David Robinson. I'm the council member

2
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:11,194
who's chairing this meeting. It's a Budget and Fiscal Affairs committee meeting.

3
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:15,294
It is Thursday, May 19, 2022, and it

4
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:18,698
is just past 09:00. A.m. Nine three and I call this meeting

5
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:22,266
to order and would like to welcome all council members and staff

6
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:26,082
who are here in attendance, and we will recognize

7
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:29,554
them very shortly. But first, I wanted to mention that this budget

8
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:33,398
workshop procedures will follow.

9
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:37,382
All budget workshops will be conducted in person, and our public

10
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:41,754
speakers have the option to comment in person or virtually 48

11
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,590
hours prior to the start of a workshop. All presentation materials

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,114
are uploaded to SharePoint and hard copies delivered to

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,942
each council office. All departments have been directed to provide

14
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:56,526
written responses within 48 hours of the conclusion of

15
00:00:56,548 --> 00:01:00,174
their presentation to any questions posted by council members

16
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:04,206
to SharePoint the budget workshop schedule is

17
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:07,522
posted on the BFA website. Questions from council members

18
00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:11,154
can be uploaded at any time during the budget workshop process,

19
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:14,946
the earlier the better, but allowing all the departments plenty of

20
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:17,862
time to respond to those questions.

21
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:21,906
All public speakers should be signed in to speak. If you have not signed

22
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:26,066

all council members and council offices to ensure productive

31
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:58,062
discussions on the fiscal year 2023 proposed

32
00:01:58,126 --> 00:02:01,474
budget only operation, budget related amendments will be

33
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:04,946
considered. Policy amendments should not be submitted and will

34
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:08,562
be ruled out of order. And please see the Mayor's

35
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:12,822
memo for additional guidelines. Amendments are

36
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:16,342
due on Wednesday, May 25, at the end of Business.

37
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:20,426
And today on our agenda, we will hear from the

38
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:24,182
Controller with a special BFA Trends

39
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:27,930
report. We'll hear also from the Controller's office.

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,162
We'll hear from the Mayor's office, from Legal,

41
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:35,310
from Planning, from City Council and

42
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,006
our office collectively, as well as the

43
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:43,086
Administrative and Regulatory Affairs Group and Municipal

44
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:46,958
courts. Today is our final day of the budget workshops.

45
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:50,882
And as a reminder, these virtual meeting rules, the only

46
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:53,890
people attending virtually are public speakers.

47
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,402
We have seven virtual public speakers signed up for public comment

48
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,654
to speak after the Houston the

49
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:05,846
Municipal Courts presentation, and there are two in person

50
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:09,938
speakers that will begin after the virtual public speakers.

51
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:13,546
We'll get to the questions after the presentation and questions from council members

52
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:17,174
have concluded. Let me take a moment to recognize my colleagues

53
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:20,394
who are in the chamber. That's Dr. Carolyn Evans

54
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:23,898
Shabbaz of district D, the district of destination,

55
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:27,534
as well as council member Amy Peck from district A.

56
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:31,182
We have staff members represented from

57
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:34,978
District C, from District G,

58
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:39,374
from district H. We have representatives from the Vice

59
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:43,230
Mayor Pro Tems office in District K from District

60
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,054
F on the West Side, as well as the at large positions

61
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,574
four and five and representing

62
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:54,706
the AtLarge Two office. I too am here and with that Controller,

63
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:58,306
it's great to see you this morning. Welcome to the Chamber and sir, the floor

64
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,674
is yours. Thank you. Council members and

65
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:06,780
staff, I'm pleased to present the Trends Report for the fiscal year ending 2023.

66
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,030
At the time of this report, the economy is showing hopeful progress

67
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,738
in the recovery from COVID-19 Pandemic.

68
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:17,962
The infusion of more than 5 trillion in federal stimulus nationwide

69
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:21,902
has contributed to the generous robust sales tax receipt seen

70
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:25,278
since the passage of COVID relief legislation

71
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:29,266
in Houston. The receipt of more than 1 billion in response and recovery funding has

72
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:33,518
buoyed the otherwise bleak fiscal outlook seen pre pandemic.

73
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:37,010
We project the increases seen in several revenue sources,

74
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,722
namely sales tax, to be temporary. The FY

75
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:44,070
23 proposed budget uses 160,000,000 in

76
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,990
American Rescue Plan funding to address a habitual budget

77
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,590
deficit. This deficit would have required drastic

78
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,966
expenditure reductions citywide absent the receipt of federal

79
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:59,190
recovery funding. So this structural deficit existed

80
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,986
before COVID and will exist after ARPA funds are expended.

81
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:06,346
The decisions we make after and during this fiscal

82
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:09,678
year, while we have the benefit of the federal dollars,

83
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:13,234
will determine the size of that deficit in the future. The more than

84
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:16,622
606,000,000 made available through ARPA funding

85
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:20,702
provides the City with a golden opportunity to make tangible progress

86
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:24,606
towards reducing the structural deficit. The Controller's

87
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:27,966
Office encourages the Administration and Council to address

88
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:31,954
the City's long term financial liabilities with these funds and avoid

89
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:35,574
adding large recurring expenditures for which city leadership will have little means

90
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:39,322
to pay in the future. With that, I'm pleased to present the trends report

91
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:42,570
for FY 23. Next slide.

92
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,090
We'll move on to the next slide.

93
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,470
This is just a graph summary of all the different financials

94
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,346
and on this slide, General Fund revenues. It shows the Controller's

95
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:59,390
Office General Fund FY 22 projections,

96
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,294
our FY 23 Trends projections and the historical

97
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:07,010
information back to FY 18. Next slide.

98
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,128
In the General Fund revenues, the Controller's

99
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:18,832
Office is projecting an increase in our General Fund revenue projection by

100
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:22,368
15.8 million, or 0.6

101
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,884
tenths of a percent from our March FY 22 Mofar

102
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:29,144
projection. The major drivers of our projected increases

103
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:31,860
are property tax and intergovernmental revenues.

104
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,196
This amount includes the ARPA funds and we've seen

105
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:39,844
strong sales tax numbers month over month. But we believe

106
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:44,280
this is the temporary cumulative result of

107
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,360
a low interest rate environment, business continuing to return

108
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,524
to post COVID routines, and lastly,

109
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:54,848
the infusion of more than 5 trillion in federal stimulus

110
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:57,900
into the national economy. Next slide.

111
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,004
Property tax revenue. The property tax revenue for FY 23

112
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:07,230
is expected to be 3.97% higher than FY 22.

113
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,200
This amount could be higher as terse payments have yet to be paid out.

114
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,136
Property tax revenue continues to be an area of interest for our office as

115
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:19,090
we monitor the effects of Senate Bill Two and Proposition One revenue cap.

116
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,980
The city is still subject to the provisions of Senate Bill Two and we believe

117
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,800
the variable in Prop One's methodology, the Growth Index,

118
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,484
has the potential to trigger SB Two for the first time. So,

119
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:33,876
as of today, both prop One and SB Two apply to the city. But Prop

120
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:37,064
One has been far more restrictive over time and that might

121
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:42,264
change. Next slide the

122
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:45,616
Taxable Values based on a preliminary expected taxable

123
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:49,416
value from the three appraisal districts, the Controller's office projects

124
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:53,180
a 9.42% increase in taxable values.

125
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,568
The final taxable values are subject to change and will be finalized when the

126
00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:59,650
certified roles are provided to the City.

127
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,652
Next slide taxable

128
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,856
value by Type residential properties make

129
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:11,024
up 53.4% of taxable values and

130
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:13,924
commercial properties make up 43.8%.

131
00:08:14,122 --> 00:08:17,604
Collectively, the two property types make up 97.2%

132
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:20,532
of taxable values and as you can see,

133
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,976
residential and commercial values last were even in

134
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:27,544
FY 16. Since then we've seen the disparity between

135
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:31,556
the two widen and we believe this is a result of the more aggressive appraisal

136
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:34,812
protests by commercial property owners and also

137
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:37,100
the significant residential development.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,860
Next slide sales

139
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,472
Tax FY 23 sales tax revenue is projected to increase

140
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:49,932
by 4.76% from our forecast FY

141
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,388
22 sales tax projection. This decrease

142
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:56,720
is an anticipated result of the effect of federal stimulus

143
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,690
tapering off.

144
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,082
Next slide the

145
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:12,454
Property Tax Rate this chart shows historical property tax rates.

146
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:15,674
The FY 23 rate is the same as the FY 22s

147
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:19,370
rate but will be updated once the Prop One calculation is finalized

148
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,880
and when the appraisal district certified roles are made available.

149
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,654
It is worth noting that FY 17 was the first year the city

150
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:30,420
had to decrease its tax rate to maintain compliance with Prop One.

151
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,778
Next slide total

152
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:39,854
Franchise Revenue total franchise revenue is projected decreased

153
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:42,440
by 2.2% from FY 22.

154
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,342
Total franchise revenue has been trending down in recent years.

155
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:50,614
We believe it's a cumulative result of SB 1152

156
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:54,262
and that's related to the telecom industries statewide

157
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:57,914
as well as consumers moving away from landlines and

158
00:09:57,952 --> 00:10:01,402
cutting the cord I e. Digital streaming instead

159
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:04,730
of cable and satellite. Next slide

160
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,326
municipal Court Revenue municipal courts fines and forfeits are expected to

161
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:14,986
decrease by 6% for FY 23 based on an expected decrease

162
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:18,750
in collections, moving violations fees and court operations

163
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,674
revenue. We've seen municipal courts continue to trend down over the years

164
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:26,610
and obviously COVID had a pretty outsized effect on those revenues.

165
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,054
Next slide General Fund Expenditure

166
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:34,786
Budget the FY 23 General Fund total expenditure budget

167
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:38,754
is expected to increase by 3.8% over FY 22 projected

168
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:43,000
expenditures. That's an increase of 101.7 million.

169
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,094
The use of ARPA funds is the equivalent to which use

170
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:51,478
of non recurring revenue source that adds pressure to the city's structurally imbalanced

171
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:55,274
budget. ARPA funds must be leveraged to address the city's

172
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:59,178
structural deficit and some of its long term liabilities.

173
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:03,486
Instead, we're adding recurring costs for which we

174
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:06,874
don't have recurring revenue to match beyond and into

175
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,498
the future. So these recurring costs will

176
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:13,662
exacerbate an already stressed,

177
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:15,570
structurally imbalanced budget.

178
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,866
Next slide. Here you can just

179
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,240
see the general fund by percentage and function.

180
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,078
Public safety, as you all know, is a lion's share of the budget as

181
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:31,350
a percentage. And you can see the other breakdowns.

182
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,882
Next slide. The cash

183
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:41,798
versus fund balance. The unassigned fund balance is expected

184
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:45,482
to increase by 18.8 million in FY 22 and

185
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:48,862
decrease by 58.8 million in FY 23.

186
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:52,394
And the projected unassigned fund balance for fiscal

187
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:55,774
year 2022 is 300 million and for 2023

188
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:59,810
is 241,000,000. Next slide,

189
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,014
the seven and a half percent fund balance requirement. The FY

190
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:09,646
projected ending fund balance is expected to be 68 million above

191
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:13,126
the required seven and a half percent less debt service and

192
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:16,806
PAYGO. This represents a fund balance of

193
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:20,520
10.4% above the required seven and a half percent.

194
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,962
This is primarily a result of the one time financing sources

195
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:28,954
offered through American Rescue Plan and the 606,000,000

196
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:32,534
in funding. But the good news is we do have a pretty substantial

197
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:34,380
fund balance at this point in time.

198
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,710
Moving on, page 16. Next slide

199
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,394
houston Airport system has

200
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:48,234
revenue was significantly impacted by the Pandemic,

201
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:51,922
but our projections for FY 23 demonstrate a rebound as more people

202
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:55,646
begin to travel by air again, as borders open and foreign

203
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:59,806
countries relax COVID regulations, we'll continue to see more international routes come

204
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:03,474
back online. We have yet to see international passenger

205
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:07,218
numbers return to pre Pandemic levels and ARPA funds

206
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:11,270
are considered grant dollars and are not included in these revenue projections.

207
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,730
Next slide,

208
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,312
aviation revenues. The COVID-19 impact on airline travel

209
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:30,788
has resulted in 370,000,000,000 lost in airline revenue worldwide

210
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:34,924
and at one point air traffic was down nearly 70%.

211
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:38,684
So you can see the impact that it's had. But again, things are

212
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:42,256
starting to rebound with the exception of the international and some

213
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:46,080
of the business travel. Next slide.

214
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,728
Aviation expenses. Expenditures are up primarily due to

215
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:55,732
personnel expenditures increasing by 6.3 million or 5.5%

216
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:59,744
from FY 22. I would caution Council

217
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:03,860
on this that we need to be vigilant about this very item

218
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,024
expenditures in his going forward, especially if

219
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:11,112
we do not see that air traffic, both business and

220
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,596
international travel, returning to pre Pandemic

221
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:18,532
levels and again continue at a growth rate that's consistent

222
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:22,540
historically. Other services and charges are up by 4%

223
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,030
due to contractual services and interfund police and fire services.

224
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,944
Next slide convention

225
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:35,340
entertainment revenue and expenses. We anticipate CNE

226
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,340
will continue to see an upward trend in the recovery from the Pandemic. In FY

227
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,864
23, revenues are expected to increase by

228
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:46,304
20.6% or 17.4 million, for a total

229
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:49,536
of 102,000,000. Expenditures are expected

230
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:53,220
to increase by 18.6%, or 17.5 million,

231
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,116
for a total of 111.9 million.

232
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:59,952
The FY 23 deficit of 9.9 million ultimately

233
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:03,544
will result in a decrease in the ending total net position, so they will

234
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:07,720
draw that from fund balance. But the hope is that in the future things

235
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,464
continue. I know Council member, you've been involved there

236
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:15,180
and seen the struggle that they've been dealing with, but we're hopeful that things return

237
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,020
and they can build up fund balance in the future with future revenue.

238
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,904
Next slide convention and

239
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:26,688
entertainment revenues. As you know,

240
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:30,636
CNE was significantly impacted. Large gatherings

241
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:33,452
and events were canceled due to COVID.

242
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:37,232
So the primary CNE revenue is hotel occupancy

243
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:40,448
tax, which is reported as non operating revenue.

244
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:44,116
Hotel tax collections are projected to increase by 15.8

245
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:47,716
million, or 20.5% when compared to FY 22,

246
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:51,716
and this shows that travelers are largely returning to pre

247
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:55,236
pandemic routines. CNE is also seeing a projected

248
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:59,172
increase in operating revenues by 22.5%, or 1.7

249
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:02,456
million. That's due to increases in parking revenue

250
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:06,284
as a result of downtown area workers and commuters returning to pre

251
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:09,980
pandemic routines. Next slide,

252
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,952
CNE expenses. The CNE is projecting an increase of 18.6

253
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:19,984
or 17.5 million in expenses when compared to FY 22.

254
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:23,868
This increase is primarily a result of increased debt service payments,

255
00:16:23,964 --> 00:16:27,364
an increase in transfer to component units, namely a transfer of 10

256
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:30,020
million to Houston first to address their deficit.

257
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,070
Next slide the combined utility System

258
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,216
Revenue and expenses. US expenditures are

259
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:44,040
projected to exceed revenues by 50.2 million in FY 23,

260
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,416
and that's primarily as a result of increased investment in sewer and

261
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:50,744
wastewater systems. And that's what's legally obligated as

262
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:53,916
part of the EPA's consent decree. As you

263
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:57,372
recall, this agreement Stipulates 2 billion investment must be made in the next

264
00:16:57,426 --> 00:17:01,292
ten years. Our office is noting an increase in personnel cost,

265
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:05,128
salary cost, as well as nearly 1.2 in performance based bonus for

266
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:09,040
FY 23. So again, as we continue

267
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,336
to see this recovery, we need to make sure, not just in our general fund,

268
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:16,340
but also in our enterprise funds, that we are managing our expenses.

269
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,964
Next slide combined

270
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:26,884
Utility System Revenue The C US total revenue is expected to increase

271
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:30,476
by 92.6 million, primarily due to increased water and

272
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:34,076
sewer sales. However, these increases are offset by

273
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:38,060
decreases in projected sales of scraps and other revenue and impact fees.

274
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,224
Next Slide c

275
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:48,336
us expenditures. C US total expenditures are

276
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:51,836
expected to increase by 328.1 million and that's

277
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:55,712
due to debt transfer to capital projects and maintenance

278
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:59,184
costs. Changes in operating and maintenance expenses

279
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:03,236
reflect increases in personnel expenses, largely due to

280
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:07,368
pay for the increase in FTE headcount by 123

281
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,210
in FY 23.

282
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,440
Next slide.

283
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,244
I think that's the end of the presentation, so happy to answer

284
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,944
any questions. Thank you very much, Controller. I appreciate that and

285
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:26,788
a number of very helpful observations.

286
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:30,424
And while I might have a question or two, I wonder if there

287
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,900
are any from the array of council members

288
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,948
assembled, we do have four

289
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,640
virtual we think there are two virtual

290
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,030
public attendees online, and we may start with those.

291
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,616
But before going to that, I want to point out that your

292
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:55,964
points about the airport system and Houston first are particularly

293
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:59,340
helpful, I think today for some of those extracurricular

294
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,436
things that we really haven't seen too much of here. We did

295
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:06,324
have a good report from the director of the airport system yesterday with

296
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:10,260
his budget and there was some narrative and discussion about

297
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,364
the surrounding overall capital campaigns

298
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:18,564
investment that they're putting into the new facility. So appreciate your reminders

299
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:22,356
on that. So with that, I believe we will go to the public speakers

300
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:25,420
and we'll call first Miss Saba Blanding.

301
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,300
Ms. Blanding, if you're there, please unmute by hitting star

302
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,576
six. I think we see. I believe I'm unmuted.

303
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:37,116
Can you all hear me? Yes. Good morning, Ms. Blanding. Oh,

304
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:40,944
wonderful morning. How are you all doing today? Doing well,

305
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:44,480
thank you. And I apologize. I was trying to

306
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,096
finish a walk before you got to us, but you're like on top of it

307
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:51,536
today, so I'm outside. Yeah, and it's

308
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:55,888
a little hard to hear you, so if you can speak slowly

309
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:58,500
and clearly, that would be very helpful.

310
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,524
Absolutely. So I just wanted to take advantage of this new

311
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:07,576
format and give you all a chance to brag on yourselves and ask what

312
00:20:07,598 --> 00:20:10,716
is the one thing you're most proud of Houston accomplishing in 2021?

313
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:13,720
And especially for district council members,

314
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,336
I'm just curious, especially for your district, specifically, what you're most proud

315
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:20,572
of? Well, thank you for that nice

316
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:23,788
question this morning from the Garden. I think I heard you say.

317
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:27,612
I don't see any district council members jumping

318
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:30,924
to respond. I know my big district.

319
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:34,172
It's the at large city. Very proud

320
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:38,064
of the diversity of our eleven distinct districts and

321
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:41,844
the incredible nature of our communities and

322
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:45,636
overlapping neighborhoods. Just makes me proud to be

323
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:48,496
a part of everything going on in the city right now. Ms.

324
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:51,430
Planning. How about you? What are you proud of?

325
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,010
Me? Yeah.

326
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,200
I really appreciated council member Plumber at

327
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,464
her amendment adding the additional two MCOT teams.

328
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:09,340
So anything we can do to invest in more

329
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,716
preventative direct mental health care is always a

330
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,028
win on my part. And I'm also loving the bike lanes you all

331
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:19,696
are doing and always the Bayou expansion is amazing.

332
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:23,536
It's a long list, so those are a top three, top of

333
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:26,656
mind. Well, very good. Thank you very much for being here today and

334
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:30,084
for your ongoing attendance here. Our next

335
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,604
speaker is Mr. Jason Oliver joining us

336
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:38,452
virtually. Mr. Oliver, if you can hit star six or

337
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,510
speak now.

338
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,536
Calling Jason Oliver. If you can unmute and

339
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:47,850
join us online.

340
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,810
Good morning. Thank you.

341
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,392
I'm thinking about this presentation and I'm wondering,

342
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:02,332
so the structural deficit is of course, something that

343
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:04,270
comes up every year.

344
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,810
If we get rid of the revenue cap,

345
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,568
I think that's around 280 or so million.

346
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:19,376
I'm wondering, will that kind of get us to

347
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:23,056
a place of being able to fully

348
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:26,596
fund some of these departments that we see are struggling, right?

349
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:30,084
If we do, will that address some of the needs that we've seen over

350
00:22:30,122 --> 00:22:33,728
the past few days? And then also in terms of ARPA

351
00:22:33,744 --> 00:22:37,224
funds, where are you seeing some strong opportunities and

352
00:22:37,262 --> 00:22:40,760
candidates for investment that we may or may not be doing?

353
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,744
I'm trying to figure out are we making those structural investments? Thank you.

354
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:48,236
Thank you, Mr. Oliver, for the question. The controller may have something

355
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:51,692
he'd like to say. Here he is. Sure. Thank you for the question. The first

356
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:55,780
part being able to repeal

357
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,452
and again, I believe that would have to be through a voter referendum,

358
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:02,370
the property revenue cap,

359
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,712
prop One, rev cap that would go a long way towards

360
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:11,876
eliminating the structural budget imbalance based on

361
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:15,652
the current numbers. The challenge is we also have SB Two,

362
00:23:15,706 --> 00:23:19,636
the statewide rollback rate cap that

363
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:23,364
we'd have to contend with. So it

364
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,936
might not be as effective as possible. But I know that there has

365
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:30,244
been discussion about that. One of the things that I've

366
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:33,864
suggested in the past, having been here now for 19

367
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,496
years and remembering Mayor Bill White, he passed

368
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:41,752
an amendment to lift the revenue cap for a specific purpose,

369
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:45,708
primarily for public safety. And he was able to,

370
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:49,936
again, through referendum, raise a $90 million cap for

371
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:53,596
public safety. That could possibly be an interim

372
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:57,170
step. And I know the administration has tossed that around in the past.

373
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,624
To the second question, the structural budget imbalances

374
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:06,612
existed before this administration, even as far back before the White

375
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:10,036
administration, during the Brown administration. So the

376
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:13,940
challenge is it keeps growing every year. And unfortunately,

377
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,960
this particular year, because of all the federal money,

378
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,256
it's going to grow substantially more, and that is

379
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,604
only cumulative into the future. One of the things

380
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:28,396
I've kind of said ad nauseam is the PFM report that the

381
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:32,936
administration and council, you know, approved and and authored

382
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:36,972
back in 2017. There are, you know, over 50

383
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:40,448
different items on there. And one of the things, in talking to the

384
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:44,092
various consultant groups that we interact

385
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:47,408
with, they said, this is a great plan, but you need someone to

386
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:50,672
go out and implement it. And specifically in the consulting world,

387
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:54,580
what they call PMO program management offices. And it takes

388
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,824
dollars to implement a lot of these things. Well, we have wonderful

389
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:02,184
employees at the city. We've been stretched thin. People are doing more

390
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:05,050
with less. So to answer your question,

391
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,904
one of my suggestions would be to take some of these federal dollars,

392
00:25:09,022 --> 00:25:12,644
invest them to implement program management offices,

393
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:16,280
essentially consulting groups to go in and to implement

394
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,328
these PFM recommendations. Because as you all recall,

395
00:25:20,504 --> 00:25:24,364
the cumulative effect of increased revenue and

396
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:28,136
reduction in expenses per the report was

397
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:31,820
around $300 million. So there's, I think, a lot of opportunities

398
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,000
to spend this money in a way that it doesn't create a recurring

399
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,984
expenditure in the future, but spend it to actually reduce

400
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:42,500
those or create new revenue.

401
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,056
Thank you very much, Controller. I think that's a very helpful

402
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:50,468
response to Mr. Oliver. Thank you for your question, sir.

403
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:54,176
And I do see one council

404
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,684
member in the queue just now. Council Member Alcorn. Go ahead. Thank you, Chair.

405
00:25:57,732 --> 00:26:01,496
And thank you, Controller. I'm sorry I walked in a little bit late and

406
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:05,004
maybe you talked a little bit about since it's a trends report,

407
00:26:05,202 --> 00:26:08,952
the trend of inflation and the trend of higher interest rates.

408
00:26:09,016 --> 00:26:12,604
How do you see that playing out in revenues and

409
00:26:12,642 --> 00:26:16,768
expenditures? So it is a challenge. We are in

410
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:20,732
a very inflationary period. We are seeing inflation

411
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:24,736
numbers that haven't been recorded since the

412
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:28,224
1980s. It's a challenge for the city in the sense

413
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:31,510
the cost of goods, of everything we purchase are going up.

414
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,732
Really to add on to that,

415
00:26:35,786 --> 00:26:38,784
interest rates are rising. So the cost of debt service and issuance,

416
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:41,460
so these are putting financial strains on the budget.

417
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,984
The good news right now is we do have a lot of federal money.

418
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:48,970
Sales taxes up, property taxes up. But one of the things that

419
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,208
I've termed, and I'm going to date myself, when I started working in

420
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:56,856
an investment bank, alan Greenspan was the Federal Reserve Chair

421
00:26:56,888 --> 00:27:00,236
and towards the end of the.com

422
00:27:00,338 --> 00:27:04,056
boom he coined a term irrational

423
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:07,264
exuberance because stocks are rising, money was

424
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:11,424
coming in. I've said I think right now

425
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:15,340
and again, I've been here 19 years, I've been through the.com I'm

426
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,652
30 years almost in financial markets.

427
00:27:18,796 --> 00:27:22,772
It seems to me a little bit like irrational exuberance. We're seeing sales

428
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:26,660
tax receipts over 20% on average. I mean, this is great news.

429
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,840
But the key for governments is it has to be sustainable.

430
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,656
And so the combined factor of

431
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:37,560
increased inflation, increases in interest rates that are going to hit debt service

432
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:41,240
and then this kind of false sense of security on revenues.

433
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,204
I'm, as I said, more cautionary going forward. And for

434
00:27:46,242 --> 00:27:49,452
this fiscal year things are good and probably

435
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:53,256
next fiscal year, but when we run out of the federal ARPA

436
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:57,324
money, when that's limited? In December of 2024.

437
00:27:57,522 --> 00:28:01,170
Really what's going to supplant that and you've talked about it in the past.

438
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,456
The key is matching recurring expenditures with recurring revenues so

439
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:09,408
we can't have a one time financing source with recurring expenditure.

440
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:11,936
Thank you, council member. And your response,

441
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:15,124
Controller. Go ahead.

442
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:18,816
Sure. Just one more question about the recent

443
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:20,500
changes to the OPEB,

444
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,384
to our retiree benefits which will bring down our

445
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:28,792
long term liability. Are you still in favor of

446
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:31,850
looking into an OPEB trust as well?

447
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,564
Yes. And I am. And this is a great example. In one of the things

448
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:39,244
that's mentioned in the PFM report, if we

449
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:43,372
set up an OPEB trust, essentially we are able to

450
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:47,564
not just do PAYGO for these retiree healthcare benefits,

451
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:50,636
we would actually invest that similar to the way we do in the pension.

452
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:54,496
We would earn a return on that money. The challenge in starting the

453
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:58,384
OPEB Trust is that we've never had the money to be able to fund

454
00:28:58,422 --> 00:29:02,516
it initially. And now we're sitting on this huge amount of federal money.

455
00:29:02,698 --> 00:29:06,212
What we can accomplish by putting 30, maybe $40

456
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:09,236
million into seat and OPEB Trust is,

457
00:29:09,338 --> 00:29:13,156
first and foremost, we can secure health care benefits for retirees, because as

458
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:16,392
you all know around this table, those are not protected by state

459
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:20,136
law. We could vote as a council body tomorrow and eliminate all

460
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,380
of the retiree health care benefits. But more importantly,

461
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,416
we can use a higher discount rate when we are evaluating that unfunded

462
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:31,132
liability. So by putting a $30 million seed and

463
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,600
starting an OPEB Trust, we could significantly reduce

464
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,616
the long term unfunded liability of the OPEB,

465
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:41,216
and we could do similar to what we did with the pensions. We had an

466
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:45,504
$8 billion unfunded liability and now closer to 1.5

467
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:48,956
billion. Even with the reforms that Council passed previously

468
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:52,644
on OPEB, we're still going to see probably in the next 15 years,

469
00:29:52,762 --> 00:29:56,608
4 billion or three plus billion dollar

470
00:29:56,704 --> 00:30:00,324
unfunded liability. This OPEB Trust spending, that amount of money

471
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:04,280
would go a long way to reducing that long term unfunded liability.

472
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,912
Thank you, Controller. That'd be a great start. Appreciate the question.

473
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:12,296
Council Member Alcorn. We're going to hear from staff from Council Member Huffman's office.

474
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:16,248
Hi, Controller. I have two questions about the PFM report that you brought up.

475
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:20,508
One, given it happened in 2017, even though we paid like $500

476
00:30:20,594 --> 00:30:23,964
million for it, do you think given all those

477
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:27,568
changes since then, those recommendations are still relevant today,

478
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:31,436
and then two, in your opinion, could ARPA

479
00:30:31,468 --> 00:30:35,180
dollars be not certainly better spent, but spent

480
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,644
on implementing some of those cost savings that the PFM report

481
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:41,476
recommends? Yeah, so good question.

482
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:44,976
I think around $580,000 that we spent

483
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:48,228
on the report. Absolutely.

484
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:51,716
To the extent the ARPA money is fungible and we

485
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:55,476
can use some of that for implementing these ideas,

486
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:58,788
I would think there would probably need to be a refresher

487
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:02,010
in the sense that yes, it has been five years.

488
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,788
But I think the good news is, based on inflation and some

489
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:09,084
of these other things, there might actually be more opportunity to

490
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:11,790
save money today than in the past.

491
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,296
But I think that the challenge is identifying

492
00:31:16,328 --> 00:31:20,032
the right teams to be able to go out and do this, that have experience

493
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,424
doing it in other cities and can do it in a cost

494
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:28,972
effective manner. Because one of the things I have seen historically

495
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:32,244
at the city is we've spent money on projects like this

496
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:35,844
and we spent a lot of money on them, and they haven't utilized the

497
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:39,556
results. So I think it's important who

498
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:42,616
you'd select. But I think absolutely, I think that was kind of the point I

499
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:46,664
made earlier. We need to be using these federal dollars to

500
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:50,436
reduce the structural imbalance in the future by adding

501
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:54,172
more revenue or reducing recurring expenditures, rather than

502
00:31:54,306 --> 00:31:56,700
adding recurring expenditures.

503
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,276
Thank you for that response and that gets to the end

504
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:04,300
of our questions from the Horseshoe.

505
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,204
And I just wanted to get one further bit of commentary

506
00:32:08,252 --> 00:32:12,412
from you. You quoted Greenspan with the irrational exuberance

507
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:15,824
of times past. And in

508
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:19,764
one of your charts for the sales tax revenue you spoke about the tapering off

509
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:23,632
effect of some of the stimulus and curious

510
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:27,872
about that, having heard recently the state's comptroller,

511
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:31,204
Mr. Hager, talk about where we are with

512
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:35,096
some of the incredible returns that we were getting through last year.

513
00:32:35,198 --> 00:32:38,772
Just in your opinion,

514
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:42,024
is that part of the irrational exuberance or is that

515
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:45,544
what's about to taper off? Well, I think it's to this point

516
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:48,860
the irrational exuberance I think we're seeing yesterday in the stock market,

517
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:53,240
for example, we're down 1100 points on the Dow. I mean, I think inflation,

518
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,372
all these things really it's the multi trillion dollars

519
00:32:57,426 --> 00:33:01,376
of money that's been pumped into the economy that's just pushed everything up.

520
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,296
It's pushed the stock market up. The rates of interest rates being

521
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:08,704
lowered have done that as well. But definitely, I think from

522
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:12,596
us. I can't remember a time at the city where we had

523
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:15,924
an eight month rolling average of over 20% in

524
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:21,004
sales tax. Now you have to couch that historically

525
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:25,370
because COVID it was down quite a bit. But even with COVID being down,

526
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,664
the rebound is spectacular. So just

527
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:34,232
a principle for governmental budgeting. You really

528
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:37,896
just plan on having a 3% to 5% increase

529
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:41,772
hopefully every year and you base it off that. And if you go way below

530
00:33:41,826 --> 00:33:45,708
that or you go way above that, that delta starts to get very difficult

531
00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:49,260
to manage. So I think we were down and now we're

532
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,656
so high up, I just caution the body that it's not going

533
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:57,212
to sustain itself. And yes, we do expect sales tax to normalize

534
00:33:57,276 --> 00:34:00,944
next year and even be down year over year. But again,

535
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:04,612
that's because we're up probably in the year, up 20% this year.

536
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:07,892
And these are good things. It's just you have to prepare when you have

537
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:11,776
very volatile times. You have to make kind of more long term strategic

538
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:15,412
decisions in the sense that it's not going to go up another three or 5%

539
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:18,612
probably next year. It's definitely not going to go up 20% again

540
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:22,276
next year. I appreciate that very much. Thanks for

541
00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:26,076
that final comment. And I think this does conclude our special called

542
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:28,476
BFA committee meeting. So. Thank you,
