00:25.938 --> 00:29.430
to the start of all workshops. Presentation material are

00:29.500 --> 00:33.174
uploaded to SharePoint and hard copies delivered to each

00:33.212 --> 00:36.726
council office. All departments have been directed to

00:36.748 --> 00:40.300
provide written responses within 48 hours

00:40.990 --> 00:44.090
of the conclusion of their presentation. To any questions

00:44.160 --> 00:48.006
posted by council members on SharePoint, the Budget Workshop schedule

00:48.038 --> 00:51.258
is posted on the BFA website. Questions from council members can

00:51.264 --> 00:54.318
be uploaded at any time during the budget workshop process.

00:54.484 --> 00:58.618
Of course, the earlier the better, which allows the departments plenty

00:58.634 --> 01:02.426
of time to provide responses. All public speakers should be signed

01:02.458 --> 01:06.034
in to speak. If you haven't, please signed in on my left, on your right.

01:06.152 --> 01:10.340
And my staff member Carolina will be monitoring the public speaker's list.

01:11.030 --> 01:14.350
Public speaker's questions should be directed to City Council.

01:14.430 --> 01:17.510
If a public speaker would like responses to any questions,

01:17.660 --> 01:21.494
they should submit their question to their district council member or at

01:21.532 --> 01:25.314
large members. Council members, the 2023 budget

01:25.362 --> 01:28.902
amendment template has been uploaded to SharePoint.

01:29.046 --> 01:32.486
And as Mayor Turner mentioned, all council

01:32.678 --> 01:36.934
offices discussions on the 2023 proposed

01:36.982 --> 01:40.934
budget will be handled there. Only operational budget related

01:40.982 --> 01:44.586
amendments will be considered. Policy amendments should not be submitted

01:44.618 --> 01:48.746
and will be ruled out of order. Amendments are due Wednesday

01:48.858 --> 01:52.414
the 25th, a week from today. Today we

01:52.452 --> 01:56.014
will hear from the Houston Airport System, houston Health Department

01:56.062 --> 01:58.930
and solid waste. As a reminder,

01:59.270 --> 02:02.866
only people attending virtually are public speakers. And we'll get

02:02.888 --> 02:07.346
to their questions after the presentations and after the questions from council member.

02:07.458 --> 02:11.106
It's my honor and pleasure to welcome Director Mario Diaz

02:11.298 --> 02:15.378
and Curtisia Hampton.

02:15.474 --> 02:18.902
Did I do right? Okay. Of the Houston Airport

02:18.966 --> 02:21.866
system to provide an update. Good to see you,

02:21.888 --> 02:25.926
Director. How's everything? This is going to be all about spaceport,

02:25.958 --> 02:29.258
right? Shoot. Okay,

02:29.344 --> 02:31.200
welcome. Good to have you all.

02:34.050 --> 02:37.680
Also, before we start yes, your mic is on. Like to welcome

02:39.090 --> 02:41.680
staff from Council Member Amy Peck's office,

02:42.210 --> 02:46.426
marianne Huffman office, colossus Nero's

02:46.458 --> 02:50.026
office, and Council Member Sally Alcorn, and staff

02:50.058 --> 02:52.670
from Vice Mayor Pro TEM Martha Castek Tatum,

02:55.050 --> 02:58.374
and the lady who just came in because

02:58.412 --> 03:02.002
I parked next to her, council Member Carolyn Nevin Shabbat

03:02.066 --> 03:04.630
and Vice Chair Edward J. Pollard.

03:06.010 --> 03:09.126
Mr. Chair, council members, welcome and thank you for the

03:09.148 --> 03:12.714
opportunity to share with you our insights into the preparation for

03:12.752 --> 03:16.794
the 2023 fiscal year budget for the Houston Airport System.

03:16.992 --> 03:21.014
What I'd like to do first is introduce the team. My team. As I've

03:21.062 --> 03:24.798
said before, it is the team that gets things done.

03:24.964 --> 03:28.282
In particular, I'd like to first introduce Jim Sesniak,

03:28.346 --> 03:31.838
our new chief operating officer. I'm really, really delighted to have him on board

03:31.924 --> 03:36.580
to help. We have Liliana Rambo, chief of Terminal and

03:37.430 --> 03:41.042
also helpful with administrative matters. Of course, you know

03:41.096 --> 03:44.510
Todd and you know Mayuri, the council liaisons.

03:44.670 --> 03:47.490
We have James Stormsky,

03:48.490 --> 03:51.650
who is the acting assistant director for Financial Planning.

03:51.730 --> 03:54.390
We have Fruit Khan who is the budget manager.

03:55.210 --> 03:58.654
We have Anna Guerrero and Uber

03:58.722 --> 04:02.342
Khan and Tanya Harris, all three of whom are financial

04:02.406 --> 04:06.182
analyst force. And they've all assisted in putting this presentation

04:06.246 --> 04:10.330
together. And then next to me, of course, is Katisha

04:11.790 --> 04:15.020
Hampton who will help me

04:15.390 --> 04:19.354
with the presentation. Now, Katisha is actually the chief auditor

04:19.402 --> 04:22.634
for the department, but since we lost our chief financial

04:22.682 --> 04:26.162
officer not too long ago, I've asked Katisha to help

04:26.216 --> 04:29.700
out pitch in and she's gladly done that. Of course,

04:30.870 --> 04:34.386
Katisha really handles more of the accounting matters for

04:34.408 --> 04:38.454
the department and I handle the financial analyses and

04:38.572 --> 04:42.914
financial aspects of the finance

04:42.962 --> 04:46.614
department. What we'd like to do today is I would

04:46.652 --> 04:50.038
first like to take this in two parts. In the first part I'm

04:50.054 --> 04:53.818
going to go through and talk about some of the accomplishments and some of

04:53.824 --> 04:57.850
the forecasts and projections that formulate the basis for the

04:57.920 --> 05:01.006
budget itself. And then Kirtisha will go through the

05:01.028 --> 05:04.238
numbers. So, next slide please. And of

05:04.244 --> 05:07.454
course we'll take questions. So the

05:07.492 --> 05:11.466
first slide shows the budget cost centers for the department.

05:11.658 --> 05:16.626
As you can see, we are proposing a total budget of $516.7

05:16.728 --> 05:20.334
million that's total revenue and total expenses

05:20.382 --> 05:25.558
and flow of to the

05:25.724 --> 05:29.110
airport infrastructure fund. We have

05:29.260 --> 05:33.186
a total of 1152 employees

05:33.218 --> 05:37.490
or full time equivalents, and we have eleven cost centers.

05:37.650 --> 05:38.940
Next slide please.

05:40.750 --> 05:44.266
When it comes to accomplishments, I think there are just three that I want to

05:44.288 --> 05:48.630
highlight and there is one Mr. Chair on the spaceport.

05:48.790 --> 05:51.680
Be patient and we'll get to it in a second.

05:52.450 --> 05:55.902
First of all, and this is the most important,

05:56.036 --> 05:59.680
and it is that we've established Hobby as a five star

06:00.210 --> 06:03.546
airport, the first five star airport in

06:03.588 --> 06:07.234
all of North America by Skytracks. It is the first of the

06:07.272 --> 06:10.686
60 odd airports that are tracked

06:10.718 --> 06:13.826
by Skytracks. And it is really important because

06:13.928 --> 06:17.710
it gets us to half of the way to our vision. Remember that

06:17.720 --> 06:21.282
the vision of the Houston airport system is to create a global air service gateway

06:21.346 --> 06:25.350
where the magic of flight is celebrated. The airport system

06:25.420 --> 06:28.722
has two commercial airports. We have the spaceport,

06:28.786 --> 06:32.054
but it's not a commercial airport. We have two commercial international airports,

06:32.102 --> 06:36.074
both of them international. And we have accomplished the mission of

06:36.112 --> 06:39.670
becoming a five star airport at Hobby.

06:39.750 --> 06:44.190
We are now focusing with all our energy and focus

06:44.340 --> 06:47.934
on intercontinental, to make that a five

06:47.972 --> 06:50.686
star as well. Now this brings us, of course,

06:50.788 --> 06:54.990
to a very, very special place in world airports.

06:55.070 --> 06:58.594
Only 16 airports, 15 and ourselves at

06:58.632 --> 07:02.100
Hobby are rated five stars around the world.

07:02.550 --> 07:05.846
And it's an accomplishment, as I say. That brings us to the point where

07:05.868 --> 07:09.094
we can now say the vision we are halfway there on

07:09.132 --> 07:12.930
the vision of becoming a global air Service gateway.

07:13.090 --> 07:16.742
Next. The next that

07:16.796 --> 07:20.346
I would like to focus on is the accomplishment of itrip. That is

07:20.368 --> 07:24.122
the International Terminal Redevelopment Program. Construction has

07:24.176 --> 07:29.100
accelerated. We are very well into the

07:29.550 --> 07:33.246
ground. We will be coming out of the ground with steel probably in the

07:33.268 --> 07:35.390
June, July time frame,

07:36.450 --> 07:39.774
the Deep West Pier. And you'll see if you come

07:39.812 --> 07:43.266
to next Thursday's Economic Development Committee, we will be putting on a

07:43.288 --> 07:47.454
presentation devoted totally to the International Terminal

07:47.502 --> 07:50.834
Redevelopment Program. And we will be featuring a

07:50.872 --> 07:55.006
section of that of concern that I know is probably on your minds today,

07:55.128 --> 07:58.210
which has been on our minds, which is the roadway congestion.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.200
So we'll address those things.

08:03.290 --> 08:06.822
The D West Pier, which is going to be the first

08:06.876 --> 08:10.742
installment to be completed, will be delivered on schedule

08:10.806 --> 08:13.846
in June, July of next year, that is, we will have a brand

08:13.878 --> 08:17.174
new pier. The rest of the renovation

08:17.222 --> 08:20.622
of the North Terminal will be completed by December of next

08:20.676 --> 08:23.886
year. And then in the June July time frame for 2024,

08:23.988 --> 08:27.230
the entire project will have been completed.

08:28.690 --> 08:32.014
We are due to,

08:32.212 --> 08:35.750
as I say, make a presentation to the Economic Development Committee

08:35.930 --> 08:39.586
on the status, the complete status. And really, it's to

08:39.608 --> 08:43.506
talk about the scale of this project. And you're going to see some slides when

08:43.528 --> 08:47.206
we come in next Thursday of the huge structures that

08:47.228 --> 08:51.958
we've got to bring in and lift into place to make this project

08:52.044 --> 08:56.146
happen. The third accomplishment that we're

08:56.178 --> 08:59.530
very, very proud of has to do with the spaceport.

09:01.870 --> 09:05.706
Next slide, please. So in

09:05.728 --> 09:09.100
the spaceport, we have been really,

09:10.850 --> 09:14.462
it can't be said in any other way, more successful than we

09:14.516 --> 09:18.670
ever imagined we would be with this spaceport having

09:18.740 --> 09:22.566
completed and brought into the spaceport

09:22.618 --> 09:26.162
system three top companies that

09:26.216 --> 09:29.938
together will, in a matter of 15 to 18 months,

09:30.024 --> 09:35.640
have about 650,000

09:37.210 --> 09:41.282
manufacturing space in the aerospace sector. These are collins

09:41.426 --> 09:45.142
Aerospace, of course, is the division of Raytheon Fortune 500

09:45.196 --> 09:48.978
company. We have intuitive machines that will be building the Nova

09:48.994 --> 09:52.074
Sea lander rocket propulsion systems. They're going

09:52.112 --> 09:56.726
to the Moon later this month, the first commercial trip

09:56.758 --> 10:00.538
back to the Moon. And it will be from a company that actually produced the

10:00.704 --> 10:03.854
landers and the propulsion system and navigation systems right

10:03.892 --> 10:07.130
here in Houston. And, of course, we have Axiom Aerospace.

10:07.210 --> 10:11.150
Axiom, as you may know, on May 21

10:11.300 --> 10:15.266
excuse me, April 21 completed its

10:15.448 --> 10:18.750
first flight to the space station,

10:18.830 --> 10:22.370
delivering astronauts and coming back. And, of course,

10:22.440 --> 10:25.734
last week, May 11, we had the groundbreaking ceremony for

10:25.772 --> 10:29.110
Axiom at the Houston spaceport.

10:29.770 --> 10:33.526
So we think that the

10:33.548 --> 10:38.026
addition of these companies, the addition of this 650,000

10:38.048 --> 10:41.578
manufacturing space will result in about 1000

10:41.664 --> 10:45.514
to 1500 jobs, new jobs, well paying jobs within

10:45.552 --> 10:48.060
the next 15 to 18 months.

10:48.910 --> 10:52.394
Next slide, please. So what does the department

10:52.442 --> 10:57.466
do? Well, I think our mission statement sums that up very, very nicely.

10:57.578 --> 11:01.102
It is that we exist to connect

11:01.156 --> 11:05.042
the people, the business cultures and economies of the world to

11:05.096 --> 11:09.550
Houston. Today, we provide about 184 destinations.

11:09.630 --> 11:12.958
From Intercontinental, 121 are domestic,

11:13.054 --> 11:16.242
63 are international. From Hobby,

11:16.306 --> 11:20.210
we provide 84 destinations. 76 are domestic

11:20.290 --> 11:24.562
and eight are international. At Intercontinental,

11:24.706 --> 11:28.530
domestic travel is exceeding international recovery,

11:28.690 --> 11:32.234
90% versus 77%. The reverse is

11:32.272 --> 11:35.558
true at Hobby. At Hobby, we're recovering faster

11:35.654 --> 11:39.466
in the international 91%. And by the way, these are percentages of

11:39.488 --> 11:43.486
2019 traffic, 91% versus 82%

11:43.588 --> 11:46.974
for domestic. We have four airlines that are

11:47.012 --> 11:50.894
exceeding their traffic levels at

11:50.932 --> 11:54.738
IH against 2019. So they're doing better,

11:54.824 --> 11:58.894
actually better than they were in 2019. We have four airlines

11:58.942 --> 12:02.494
that are still in the recovery phase. We have one airline

12:02.542 --> 12:06.210
that's gone bankrupt, was Interjet. They simply couldn't make it.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.926
And we have two airlines, Ethiopian and Air China, that have

12:09.948 --> 12:13.462
not returned yet. But we expect Ethiopian Airlines to return probably

12:13.516 --> 12:16.998
in the summer of this year. And hopefully Air China will be

12:17.164 --> 12:21.206
not too far behind. And then, despite the Pandemic,

12:21.318 --> 12:25.014
we're very, very happy to announce that airlines like Allegiant,

12:25.142 --> 12:28.746
Frontier, Southwest, American,

12:28.848 --> 12:32.266
Caribbean Airlines, delta, Spirit, Suncountry, United,

12:32.368 --> 12:35.690
Viva, Airbus, and Veladis, all added flights,

12:35.770 --> 12:39.534
all added service during the Pandemic that we have

12:39.572 --> 12:42.750
just transitioned through. Next slide.

12:43.990 --> 12:47.986
So our strategic plan is fairly simple.

12:48.088 --> 12:50.782
It's laid out, as I said, there's the mission,

12:50.846 --> 12:54.446
and I've talked to the vision. What we are focusing

12:54.478 --> 12:58.310
on is acting responsibly with

12:58.380 --> 13:01.800
respect to social, environmental and

13:02.250 --> 13:05.974
economic concerns. As I've mentioned, we are

13:06.012 --> 13:09.446
generating jobs focusing on how to train the youth

13:09.478 --> 13:13.062
of Houston for careers in aerospace manufacturing,

13:13.126 --> 13:16.794
and improving the financial resilience of the airport system. That goes

13:16.832 --> 13:20.406
to the second bullet, the International Terminal Redevelopment

13:20.438 --> 13:24.090
Program, the Domestic Terminal Redevelopment Program that we're going to launch

13:24.170 --> 13:27.374
as part of the capital program in the coming year.

13:27.412 --> 13:30.874
And Southwest Airlines seven gate expansion

13:30.922 --> 13:34.330
at Hobby are all platforms for future success.

13:34.500 --> 13:38.606
And then, of course, we have collaboration with airlines, the federal agencies,

13:38.718 --> 13:42.226
and concessionaires and contractors. All in addition to

13:42.248 --> 13:45.990
the work that we're doing in shifting the culture within the organization

13:46.730 --> 13:50.946
that addresses the final priority, which is to build relationships

13:51.058 --> 13:55.142
and conditions for

13:55.196 --> 13:55.990
betterment.

13:58.750 --> 14:02.906
As you can see, what we really want to do is in

14:02.928 --> 14:04.140
the next slide, please.

14:05.950 --> 14:09.922
This slide shows traffic in graph

14:10.006 --> 14:13.502
form. I'll have a slide that comes

14:13.556 --> 14:17.642
right after this that'll simplify it. But you can see the vagaries

14:17.786 --> 14:21.470
month by month, year by year. We start with

14:21.540 --> 14:24.966
the blue, which is the 2019,

14:24.968 --> 14:27.890
and then from there, you descend down.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.962
I would just point to two graphs on this.

14:31.016 --> 14:34.690
That is the one for 2022,

14:34.840 --> 14:38.270
which terminates at 25.5 million. That's what we expect at

14:38.280 --> 14:41.558
the end of this year, June 30, when we finalize the

14:41.564 --> 14:44.600
numbers, we'll come out at about $25.5 million,

14:45.290 --> 14:49.266
25.5 million passengers. And then for

14:49.308 --> 14:53.066
2023, we're forecasting 29 million.

14:53.168 --> 14:56.822
And that's just about 800,000 short of the 2019

14:56.966 --> 14:59.980
all time high. Next slide, please.

15:00.430 --> 15:04.238
This slide better shows the point that I was making

15:04.324 --> 15:08.010
about the trajectory and the path that we're following.

15:08.090 --> 15:11.150
As you can see, we started out in 29.8

15:11.220 --> 15:13.586
million employments in 2019,

15:13.588 --> 15:17.706
and then of course, we dropped off and we bottomed

15:17.738 --> 15:21.154
out in 2021, fiscal year 2021. And then we've been

15:21.192 --> 15:25.410
increasing to where at the end of this year, we expect to be about 25.5

15:25.480 --> 15:29.400
and next year 29.8. And then we'll continue on from there.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.922
And so that concludes my part of the presentation.

15:33.986 --> 15:37.478
If there are no questions at this point, I'll turn it over to Katisha and

15:37.484 --> 15:41.450
she will carry on with the numbers. Next slide.

15:42.830 --> 15:46.362
Good afternoon. So I'm going to talk about revenues by

15:46.416 --> 15:47.020
fund.

15:50.610 --> 15:53.918
Oh, lord. Sorry. Thank you. I'm going

15:53.924 --> 15:57.486
to talk about revenues by fund. And I'm really going

15:57.508 --> 16:01.530
to home in on our FY 19

16:01.610 --> 16:04.942
actuals versus our proposed FY

16:05.006 --> 16:07.986
23 because our FY 29,

16:08.168 --> 16:11.998
this is more because we dipped down during the pandemic.

16:12.174 --> 16:16.150
But we are expected to either

16:16.220 --> 16:19.926
match or exceed 19 with our

16:19.948 --> 16:23.942
revenues and expenditures and our employments. So in FY 23,

16:23.996 --> 16:31.306
we propose our budget is about 516,719,000.

16:31.488 --> 16:35.126
In FY 19, it was about 518.

16:35.238 --> 16:39.274
So we're about 2 million under budget for

16:39.312 --> 16:42.890
I mean, under revenues to match 2019,

16:42.970 --> 16:46.414
which we're back on track. For FY 22, we had

16:46.452 --> 16:49.834
478. So our budget has increased

16:49.882 --> 16:53.890
about 8.1%. And if you go to the next slide

16:55.830 --> 16:59.570
so our budget has increased by 8.1%

16:59.640 --> 17:03.582
over our FY 22 estimate. And our airline

17:03.646 --> 17:07.090
revenues for landing and terminal rents are projected

17:07.170 --> 17:10.120
to increase by 11.6 million.

17:10.810 --> 17:14.722
Non revenues, parking will increase

17:14.866 --> 17:19.046
by 12.1, ground transportation and terminal

17:19.078 --> 17:22.060
concessions by 9.3 million.

17:23.230 --> 17:26.380
And car rentals, about 4 million.

17:26.750 --> 17:29.958
Revenues from facilities and other

17:30.064 --> 17:33.194
miscellaneous revenues are projected to increase

17:33.242 --> 17:37.642
about 3 million. And our other miscellaneous

17:37.706 --> 17:40.830
includes ground rents, hangers rentals,

17:44.710 --> 17:47.410
facility rentals, and interest income.

17:49.030 --> 17:52.786
Next slide, please. We want to

17:52.808 --> 17:56.114
show you our COVID related grants that the airport has

17:56.152 --> 18:00.134
received. So and we've received about

18:00.252 --> 18:04.582
460,000,000, which is 458,000,000

18:04.716 --> 18:06.470
that we have received,

18:07.930 --> 18:11.786
that we are eligible for sorry, that's available to us.

18:11.968 --> 18:16.586
We've received as of April 30 of 2022,

18:16.688 --> 18:19.740
we received 295,000,000.

18:20.510 --> 18:24.382
Of that, we've used the entire 295.

18:24.516 --> 18:28.222
So we have about 169,000,000 still

18:28.276 --> 18:31.962
available for us to use for our COVID

18:32.026 --> 18:33.410
related grants.

18:34.950 --> 18:38.994
Next slide, please. And now

18:39.032 --> 18:43.230
I'm going to go to expenditures. So our expenditures

18:43.310 --> 18:47.170
for FY 23, we are proposed

18:47.670 --> 18:50.670
to spend the 516,

18:50.830 --> 18:54.114
719. And we can look at FY

18:54.162 --> 18:58.102
19 we had our actual was 519

18:58.166 --> 19:01.530
million. 519,000,000. So we're about 3

19:01.600 --> 19:05.690
million below our FY 19 expenditures.

19:09.890 --> 19:11.040
Next slide, please.

19:14.450 --> 19:16.750
So our expenditure highlights,

19:18.530 --> 19:22.422
we're about 4.4% increase

19:22.586 --> 19:26.894
our expenditures and that is due to personnel increase

19:27.022 --> 19:28.900
by 6.3 million.

19:30.790 --> 19:34.574
Supplies and capital and supplies and non capital

19:34.622 --> 19:38.454
equipment, we're going to increase that by about 0.2

19:38.492 --> 19:42.614
million, about 200,000. Our contracted services are

19:42.652 --> 19:45.480
increasing by 4.1%.

19:48.190 --> 19:51.660
And we just want to point out here at the bottom,

19:52.110 --> 19:57.866
we pay about 1.3 million and

19:57.888 --> 20:02.006
3 million of our general fund is

20:02.048 --> 20:05.498
services to the city for HPD,

20:05.674 --> 20:09.434
fire rescue, HR, it legal

20:09.562 --> 20:11.870
water and sewer, et cetera.

20:13.270 --> 20:16.786
Next slide, please. So this is the

20:16.888 --> 20:20.562
expenditures, the change in every line

20:20.616 --> 20:23.170
item by category,

20:25.190 --> 20:28.646
and I'm going to talk more about that on the next slide. So next

20:28.668 --> 20:32.198
slide please. Oh, perfect, thank you. So this is our

20:32.284 --> 20:35.990
FY 23, which is our expenditures

20:38.490 --> 20:41.674
for 8012 I'm sorry,

20:41.792 --> 20:45.962
which is our capital improvement. So it's about 26,000,001.

20:46.016 --> 20:50.762
Three six. For our FY 23 and FY 19,

20:50.906 --> 20:54.494
we're looking at about 3 million. And that is due to

20:54.532 --> 20:58.382
our increase in all our 4%

20:58.436 --> 21:02.074
increase in all our facility maintenance, our police,

21:02.122 --> 21:05.758
fire, rescue act, aircraft rescue, utilities,

21:05.854 --> 21:08.740
et cetera. Next slide, please.

21:16.410 --> 21:20.710
Our expenditure highlights. In our capital outlay fund,

21:20.780 --> 21:24.806
which is our fund 8012, our expenditures are

21:24.908 --> 21:30.154
projected to increase by 828.7%

21:30.272 --> 21:34.742
over our FY 22 estimate. And that is mainly

21:34.886 --> 21:38.374
driven by our replacement of our has,

21:38.422 --> 21:42.154
our fleet vehicles and HPD

21:42.282 --> 21:46.862
vehicles. We actually had purchased vehicles in FY 22

21:46.996 --> 21:50.314
and we did not receive them. So therefore,

21:50.362 --> 21:54.090
they had to be rolled over into our FY 23 budget.

21:54.170 --> 21:58.094
So that is mainly the reason for such a high increase

21:58.142 --> 22:01.986
in our capital outlay. And we had about 0.7 in

22:02.008 --> 22:05.418
our computer and hardware, computer hardware and software,

22:05.534 --> 22:10.262
and about 0.5 million into our

22:10.316 --> 22:11.910
furniture and equipment.

22:13.530 --> 22:17.110
And just so I wanted to reiterate here,

22:17.180 --> 22:20.854
we're buying 25 electric FY F

22:20.892 --> 22:24.554
150s that those are in that fleet that

22:24.592 --> 22:27.734
will be rolled over for the FY 23 proposed

22:27.782 --> 22:30.410
budget. Next slide.

22:31.330 --> 22:35.322
We wanted to break out our FY 23 budget,

22:35.466 --> 22:38.814
personnel versus non personnel. And if you

22:38.852 --> 22:42.080
look at non personnel, it was about 61%.

22:42.710 --> 22:46.658
Fire rescue is the biggest portion of our

22:46.744 --> 22:50.382
non revenue. But I also wanted to highlight

22:50.446 --> 22:54.014
on our contracted services, so our contracted

22:54.062 --> 22:57.366
services are a big portion of

22:57.388 --> 23:01.634
our non personnel as well. And so some of our top contracted

23:01.682 --> 23:05.782
services are our security contract, which is about 4.8

23:05.836 --> 23:09.722
million, landscaping is about 1.6

23:09.776 --> 23:13.322
million, smart cart is about 1.4

23:13.376 --> 23:17.722
million, and our asset management is about 6.2.6

23:17.776 --> 23:20.586
million. Next slide,

23:20.618 --> 23:24.366
please. Here is a slide on

23:24.388 --> 23:28.350
our budget history. If you look at our FY 23

23:28.500 --> 23:32.074
proposed budget versus our FY

23:32.122 --> 23:35.502
19, we are pretty much on target

23:35.566 --> 23:39.410
with our budget versus our actuals with

23:39.480 --> 23:42.802
our FY 19 year, because that is going to be

23:42.936 --> 23:46.802
our year that we are comparing FY 23

23:46.936 --> 23:50.774
to because our passenger levels are back around that

23:50.812 --> 23:54.040
level. Next slide, please.

23:55.530 --> 23:58.758
And again, we want to thank you for our

23:58.844 --> 24:02.490
prep budget presentation hearing and to reiterate that

24:02.640 --> 24:06.074
Hobby is the first five star airport in

24:06.112 --> 24:09.020
North America. Any questions?

24:09.630 --> 24:12.974
Yes, we have a number of council members in queue. We'll first go

24:13.012 --> 24:16.350
to council member Abby Cayman. Thank you, Mayor Protem,

24:16.770 --> 24:20.686
Director. Congratulations to you and

24:20.708 --> 24:24.930
the entire airport system team, our partners at the airlines.

24:25.590 --> 24:29.582
It's hard to know where to begin, right. With all of the success and progress

24:29.646 --> 24:33.330
that's been made, whether it's at the spaceport or our traditional airports.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.946
I wanted to just spotlight we have a lot of residents

24:37.998 --> 24:41.446
that are continuing to enjoy the new child play area at

24:41.468 --> 24:45.222
Hobby. When I was in there, I'm seeing it packed all the time. That's great.

24:45.276 --> 24:48.674
The new pet areas. Can you remind

24:48.722 --> 24:52.394
me? I believe you touched on it at the beginning, but there's been a lot

24:52.432 --> 24:56.134
of headaches. Understandably so around Intercontinental

24:56.262 --> 24:59.434
with all of the construction, and you've been

24:59.472 --> 25:02.880
very responsive to those needs. But can you go back to

25:03.330 --> 25:06.862
when residents can expect some relief there?

25:06.916 --> 25:09.850
Sure. Thank you for the question, council member.

25:10.010 --> 25:13.214
And so again, next Thursday, we'll have a much

25:13.252 --> 25:16.754
more in depth presentation. But let me quickly tick off a couple

25:16.792 --> 25:21.138
of points. The first point that I would make is that I think we're over

25:21.304 --> 25:22.900
the hump on this one.

25:24.310 --> 25:27.586
If we could do it over, actually, we'd have to do

25:27.608 --> 25:31.190
it the same way. Here's the problem. It's real estate.

25:31.930 --> 25:35.234
The way that we might have done it had we had the real estate,

25:35.282 --> 25:38.806
was we would have built temporary roadways and put all the traffic on

25:38.828 --> 25:42.826
the temporary roadways while we did the construction. But real

25:42.848 --> 25:46.742
estate doesn't exist. We're in a canyon. Once you get into those roadways,

25:46.806 --> 25:51.258
you've got parking garages on one side of the street, and you've got terminal building,

25:51.424 --> 25:54.138
and we've got to work in those streets.

25:54.314 --> 25:57.774
I think people don't appreciate the scale. And so please come

25:57.812 --> 26:00.974
next Thursday so that you can understand the scale and you can see the

26:01.012 --> 26:05.338
huge structures that we're moving on these caterpillars

26:05.514 --> 26:08.420
and actually lifting at night and putting into place.

26:09.910 --> 26:13.298
We're just not replacing the roof or replacing windows in a building.

26:13.384 --> 26:17.654
We are completely redoing the entire international building.

26:17.772 --> 26:19.750
But to the point precisely.

26:22.970 --> 26:26.150
But to the point precisely.

26:26.570 --> 26:30.406
As of June 6, we will have finished the elevators

26:30.438 --> 26:33.338
in the international terminal. Why is this important?

26:33.424 --> 26:36.902
Because we could not bring handicap

26:37.046 --> 26:41.130
passengers down to the lower level to take them through the tunnels

26:41.470 --> 26:45.102
to the other terminal buildings. And so what we're doing is, once those

26:45.156 --> 26:48.734
elevators are in place, we will take the buses that

26:48.772 --> 26:52.794
were outside that were transporting passengers, and we will use those buses

26:52.842 --> 26:56.814
will be removed, and we'll have another lane open that will increase the capacity

26:56.862 --> 27:00.766
on the roadways. Number two, in July, United Airlines,

27:00.798 --> 27:04.674
as you know, they're building that at the same time. And we

27:04.792 --> 27:07.670
probably could have done a little bit better of coordinating with them on that.

27:07.740 --> 27:11.142
But they're building this massive early bag short system because

27:11.196 --> 27:14.946
they really want to grow in Houston. It's a 400 million dollar

27:14.978 --> 27:18.166
investment. It's wonderful once they have it

27:18.188 --> 27:22.374
in place. But they needed to take down the roadways, and they limited

27:22.422 --> 27:25.734
to one lane. Now, they tell us that as of July,

27:25.862 --> 27:28.742
middle of July, that lane will be improved,

27:28.806 --> 27:32.706
and the departures lane will all merge so that traffic

27:32.758 --> 27:36.446
should flow much more smoothly through that area. And then in October of

27:36.468 --> 27:39.962
this year, that will be done. That project will be done, and roadways

27:40.026 --> 27:43.758
will be cleared. June 6

27:43.764 --> 27:47.570
of next year, we will have the first installment for

27:47.640 --> 27:50.766
the, as I said, the Dwest Pier. And once that Dwest

27:50.798 --> 27:55.378
Pier is opened, we will have a much better time and

27:55.544 --> 27:58.854
movement of traffic off of the roadways on the north the

27:58.892 --> 28:02.562
terminal into that area. And then come June,

28:02.626 --> 28:05.986
July of 2024, the project is finished.

28:06.098 --> 28:09.894
Now, that's not to say it's over, because immediately

28:10.022 --> 28:13.626
we are now focusing on the infrastructure inside the

28:13.648 --> 28:17.462
roadways. We're replacing all of the water lines, the water mains.

28:17.526 --> 28:21.514
We've got to put in high pressure water, because once we

28:21.552 --> 28:25.070
start councilman Robinson, you know that once we touch a building,

28:25.140 --> 28:28.286
you now must meet the new codes. And one

28:28.308 --> 28:32.010
of those codes means you got to be sprinklers. We don't have the water pressure.

28:32.090 --> 28:36.530
And so the new early the enabling project

28:36.600 --> 28:40.046
that we have for the water will provide tanks, provide new wells

28:40.078 --> 28:43.506
and pumps that will and new lines that will be able

28:43.528 --> 28:48.094
to keep the water pressure at high enough level to actually sprinkle

28:48.142 --> 28:51.286
all of the buildings without having to have pumps and tanks in each one of

28:51.308 --> 28:55.158
those buildings. So that will continue. And then next year, we're going to

28:55.164 --> 28:58.600
be starting on the same project

28:58.910 --> 29:02.860
just at the other end of the terminal. The terminal a redevelopment program.

29:03.470 --> 29:06.554
It's another billion plus investment we need to

29:06.592 --> 29:09.866
make because we need to continue investing for

29:09.888 --> 29:13.130
the airlines. They've asked us for 17 gates. We have a plan.

29:13.280 --> 29:16.478
We will be bringing that forward to Economic Development Committee as

29:16.484 --> 29:20.462
well. So I do think that we are now really starting

29:20.516 --> 29:23.746
to see the light at the end of the tunnel on this. And we hope

29:23.768 --> 29:27.970
that as the summer progresses, things will improve continually.

29:28.390 --> 29:32.078
If I could be placed back in queue. Council Member Sally

29:32.094 --> 29:33.090
Alcorn.

29:36.070 --> 29:39.038
Thank you, Chair. On page 14,

29:39.214 --> 29:43.174
the $103,000,000 breakdown that you give to the that

29:43.212 --> 29:46.578
goes to to the city, to the general fund. If I could just you don't

29:46.594 --> 29:48.566
have to give it to me now, but if I could get a breakdown on

29:48.588 --> 29:52.040
that. Sure. And and to Council Member Cayman's Point,

29:52.490 --> 29:56.410
what what can we do in this budget cycle to help you

29:56.480 --> 29:59.370
with the traffic situation? Is it HPD?

30:00.030 --> 30:04.006
It's really hard to explain what you just explained to constituents

30:04.038 --> 30:07.166
who call that's a lot of

30:07.188 --> 30:11.134
moving parts. Is there anything else besides just

30:11.172 --> 30:15.600
the things that have to happen to open up lanes that can be done to

30:16.130 --> 30:19.506
steer traffic? We tell people, take the train to

30:19.528 --> 30:22.242
A, we'll pick you up at A, or get the Uber from A or whatever.

30:22.296 --> 30:26.046
I mean, what kind of practical advice or what can we do during the budget

30:26.078 --> 30:29.366
cycle to help you. I think that the

30:29.388 --> 30:33.526
one point that we try to make over and over. And I know we

30:33.548 --> 30:37.058
do it lightly because we don't want people to think that they've

30:37.074 --> 30:40.774
got to spend their life at the airport, but come

30:40.812 --> 30:44.810
early so that you have enough time to get to the traffic

30:45.230 --> 30:48.390
so that you are comfortable that you will make your flight.

30:48.470 --> 30:51.590
And then here's the second thing we're doing. One of the things that we've noticed

30:51.670 --> 30:55.390
is that what we call irregular operations. So for example,

30:55.460 --> 30:59.374
let's say that we have once the flights launch from Asia, they launch from

30:59.412 --> 31:03.066
Europe. They can't stop. They've got to continue. Once they're over the North Atlantic

31:03.098 --> 31:06.818
or the Pacific, you just can't tell those airplanes to return.

31:06.984 --> 31:10.398
But let's say the weather changes and we're

31:10.414 --> 31:13.614
now in a thunderstorm condition. Those aircraft

31:13.662 --> 31:18.366
have to be held. They start circulating at altitudes of about 1000ft.

31:18.478 --> 31:21.638
They're stacked one on top of another. And of course,

31:21.724 --> 31:25.606
I was going to go pick up grandma or my wife or my kids and

31:25.628 --> 31:28.566
they were supposed to arrive at five. Well, guess what? The aircraft is still in

31:28.588 --> 31:31.798
hold position and now I am circulating. So what we're going

31:31.804 --> 31:35.322
to do as one of the measures that we were taking is

31:35.376 --> 31:38.662
when we see this condition, we're going to open up the parking garages.

31:38.726 --> 31:41.434
We're going to just let people go in. We're not going to charge them.

31:41.472 --> 31:45.306
We need to get them off the roadways. We need to find containment areas

31:45.338 --> 31:48.554
where we can get them off the roadways. And that way the traffic will circulate

31:48.602 --> 31:51.342
much better. Okay,

31:51.396 --> 31:54.542
great. And just congrats on the spaceport stuff too.

31:54.596 --> 31:58.034
And on hobby. I mean, that's the most and to me the most exciting thing

31:58.072 --> 32:00.980
going on in Houston, Texas right now. It's really great.

32:01.830 --> 32:05.554
Council member. Cayman. Thank you.

32:05.592 --> 32:09.214
Chair Director just as we talked about

32:09.272 --> 32:13.074
construction, I just want to highlight and we can discuss offline the importance

32:13.122 --> 32:16.518
of as we're looking at new plans and new facilities. We are

32:16.524 --> 32:19.642
now the hub of innovation as we've always been. But that's really our thing.

32:19.696 --> 32:23.322
So I want to make sure that as we're building, our buildings themselves

32:23.456 --> 32:26.454
are pushing the envelope in terms of sustainability,

32:26.582 --> 32:30.238
resiliency best practices in

32:30.244 --> 32:33.786
terms of environmental sustainability.

32:33.978 --> 32:38.846
Really quickly, I wanted to recognize you all at

32:38.868 --> 32:42.286
the airports we got an increase in the minimum wage to 15, which I

32:42.308 --> 32:45.570
think is a really remarkable and important thing to recognize.

32:46.950 --> 32:50.418
My hope is that you all will continue to look again. We've just passed at

32:50.424 --> 32:54.306
the city paid parental leave, going to

32:54.328 --> 32:58.494
the next step in terms of our Janitorial contracts, our subcontractors,

32:58.542 --> 33:02.422
things like that, to push to make sure that everyone is included in those things.

33:02.556 --> 33:05.814
And if you all could provide just offline and we can submit the question and

33:05.852 --> 33:09.814
update on the progress in terms of Janitorial

33:09.862 --> 33:12.860
pay and things like that, I would appreciate that. Sure.

33:14.990 --> 33:18.346
Finally, Council Member Alcorn asked it,

33:18.368 --> 33:21.914
and I'll ask it a different way, given the constraints that

33:21.952 --> 33:26.394
the city continues to face. I know the airports are succeeding.

33:26.442 --> 33:29.726
They are doing very well. Are there any other needs that we should be

33:29.748 --> 33:32.746
aware of that are coming up on the horizon that you want to flag for

33:32.788 --> 33:36.578
us? I can't think of any. You've been very

33:36.664 --> 33:40.482
supportive. We're very grateful, and thank you for everything

33:40.536 --> 33:43.586
you're doing to support us on this. Thanks so

33:43.608 --> 33:46.882
much. Thank you. So,

33:46.936 --> 33:50.646
Director, nobody else in queue, I'll ask a couple of questions. So I'm looking at

33:50.668 --> 33:54.198
your revenue page. $517,000,000.

33:54.364 --> 33:57.746
Do we have any additional funds that come in from FAA

33:57.858 --> 33:59.580
and all that kind of stuff?

34:01.230 --> 34:05.034
Your budget is always the most difficult one to understand

34:05.152 --> 34:08.682
because you have sources of revenue and expenses all over the place that

34:08.736 --> 34:12.906
are not in the general fund. So we don't have purview to it.

34:13.088 --> 34:16.926
If you look at the CAFR, it has four line items every monthly, and you

34:16.948 --> 34:20.880
can't get much with four line items. So I'm trying to dig down into

34:21.730 --> 34:24.706
everything you have coming in, everything you have going out,

34:24.808 --> 34:28.578
including the what's our international stuff called

34:28.664 --> 34:32.434
hasdc does

34:32.472 --> 34:35.766
not well, I know, but it still has a

34:35.788 --> 34:39.666
revenue stream. I get it. It's a separate organization.

34:39.778 --> 34:43.030
I get it. But when it has Houston Airport system

34:43.100 --> 34:47.014
on it, then I feel somewhat I

34:47.052 --> 34:50.582
should be knowledgeable, but no one knows anything about

34:50.636 --> 34:53.498
them. Maybe that's way it's supposed to be, I don't know. But getting back to

34:53.504 --> 34:56.650
my original question, on the revenue side,

34:56.720 --> 34:57.850
517,

35:01.390 --> 35:04.160
is there FAA money? What does that amount to?

35:04.770 --> 35:09.194
You make a good point. So let's look what what this budget addresses.

35:09.322 --> 35:11.998
General fund is what we call operating revenue, right?

35:12.084 --> 35:15.726
Operating revenue. Let's talk about non operating revenue from an accounting point

35:15.748 --> 35:19.922
of view. So there are a couple of more line items on revenue that

35:20.056 --> 35:23.330
we would address or we would bring forward for your attention. For example,

35:23.400 --> 35:26.606
the biggest of those, aside from grants,

35:26.638 --> 35:30.114
we'll get to grants in a second. We'll focus on a second. But the biggest

35:30.242 --> 35:33.810
non operating revenue that we have, of course, is PFCs.

35:33.970 --> 35:35.626
So we collect 450,

35:35.628 --> 35:39.770
and we just multiply 450 times

35:39.920 --> 35:43.114
30 million employments. You're at 120,

35:43.232 --> 35:48.954
some odd million dollars, 120 plus maybe $140,000,000

35:49.072 --> 35:52.346
of PFC revenue. Now, it's restricted with

35:52.368 --> 35:55.870
respect to what we can do for it, but we can use it for four

35:55.940 --> 35:59.102
purposes. Number one is to expand the national Airspace system.

35:59.156 --> 36:02.382
That is, if we can use it for runways, taxways and things like that.

36:02.436 --> 36:06.202
We can use it for terminal buildings. We could use it to security,

36:06.356 --> 36:09.874
to enhance the security of the airports. We could use

36:09.912 --> 36:13.506
for noise mitigation around the communities. And we have spent some

36:13.528 --> 36:16.362
of that money, and we use it for competition to bring in new airlines.

36:16.446 --> 36:20.294
So that's what the roughly 100 and 3140

36:20.332 --> 36:24.150
million PFCs can be used for. And it's very helpful.

36:24.490 --> 36:28.086
Principally, we. Use PFCs to write down the

36:28.108 --> 36:31.930
debt service that we have to pay every year. That's how we use the money.

36:32.080 --> 36:35.786
The second source of course, is in this case for the past

36:35.888 --> 36:39.670
is the grants, the Cares Krisa

36:39.750 --> 36:43.680
and ARPA grants. $450,000,000, that's a one off thing.

36:44.050 --> 36:47.694
And as Katisha said, we've received about 300 million

36:47.732 --> 36:51.214
of it. There's still about 160,000,000 or so to be

36:51.252 --> 36:55.294
received and we're using those monies. We did use about 92

36:55.332 --> 36:58.882
million of that debt, as you saw on the line, of 120,

36:58.936 --> 37:02.350
some odd million to assist the airlines

37:02.430 --> 37:05.166
because to the extent that we use grants, they didn't have to pay the debt

37:05.198 --> 37:09.062
service on that grant. But again, the line

37:09.116 --> 37:12.626
share as you see on that page, is really again to offset

37:12.658 --> 37:16.422
debt service. And for next year we'll be using another 50 million

37:16.476 --> 37:21.350
and then another 50 million. And that'll essentially

37:21.430 --> 37:24.362
use up the remainder of the grants that we have.

37:24.496 --> 37:28.198
2nd, 3rd item is grants, FA grants.

37:28.294 --> 37:31.434
So we receive. And we

37:31.472 --> 37:34.746
need to do a better job because we think that there's more FAA grants

37:34.778 --> 37:37.706
out there to be to be obtained,

37:37.818 --> 37:41.582
but roughly about $50 to $60 million a year that

37:41.636 --> 37:44.970
we want to bring in on an annual basis,

37:45.050 --> 37:48.946
either in terms of entitlements, because we are entitled to grants on

37:48.968 --> 37:52.242
the basis of passenger traffic and cargo that we move through our

37:52.296 --> 37:56.422
two airports. Our three airports. And then of course, the last one

37:56.476 --> 37:59.846
is interest on reserves. We have about a

37:59.868 --> 38:04.482
billion dollars in the bank and so inflation

38:04.546 --> 38:08.242
is when interest rates rise. Of course that becomes

38:08.386 --> 38:12.090
a fairly good source of additional incremental income. So those four

38:12.160 --> 38:15.738
sources are not in these numbers, right? And before we

38:15.744 --> 38:18.506
go, I know council Member David Robinson's in Q. Yes,

38:18.688 --> 38:22.590
here's my problem, okay? And this is just a me issue.

38:22.740 --> 38:26.414
I pride myself on trying to know everything about the

38:26.452 --> 38:30.302
financial position the city is in, whether it's public

38:30.356 --> 38:33.946
works, whether it's enterprise, whether it's general, whether it's airport,

38:33.978 --> 38:37.554
and nothing. We have a guy who shows up here every

38:37.592 --> 38:41.182
other week. He has a name very similar to yours and he sticks a microphone

38:41.246 --> 38:45.006
in front of all of our eyes, ears and mouths

38:45.198 --> 38:49.320
with questions that quite frankly we can't answer

38:49.690 --> 38:53.266
and when we can't answer. And they show it, they love showing

38:53.298 --> 38:56.550
it on the news to make us look like a bunch of idiots,

38:57.450 --> 38:59.880
quite frankly. That's it.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.882
That's part of the world we live in today. It's a lot different than,

39:05.936 --> 39:10.042
you know, Walter Cronkite days, but there's a mission and

39:10.176 --> 39:13.434
I feel so inept many times when I see

39:13.472 --> 39:16.618
him out there and I run away from him because I know what questions he's

39:16.634 --> 39:20.638
going to ask and it's going to be related to your enterprise and I feel

39:20.724 --> 39:24.254
inadequate about answering it. I don't know how everybody else around here

39:24.292 --> 39:27.554
feels, but that's just a me issue because there are so

39:27.592 --> 39:31.054
many moving parts and you and I have had various conversations.

39:31.102 --> 39:34.418
I've been here longer than anyone, and I trust you implicitly, and you do a

39:34.424 --> 39:37.814
great job. And the Houston Airport System is

39:37.852 --> 39:41.174
a well run, organized machine. Some of the things

39:41.212 --> 39:44.450
we do there, especially what's going to happen down south,

39:44.530 --> 39:49.782
is monumental. But FCC

39:49.926 --> 39:53.434
money, general funds, revenue, all these different things.

39:53.632 --> 39:59.020
And then a guy shows up with a microphone, and I just feel

39:59.390 --> 40:02.974
unprepared many times. So that's why some of my questions dig

40:03.012 --> 40:06.654
a little bit deeper. Ha SDC. I'd love to know what

40:06.692 --> 40:09.866
more is there about the Houston Airport System Development

40:09.898 --> 40:14.078
Corporation? We should be proud that we have airports that we run,

40:14.164 --> 40:17.762
operate in Costa Rica, in other parts of the world,

40:17.816 --> 40:22.238
nobody else is doing innovative things like this. So I'd

40:22.254 --> 40:25.666
like to know more about it so I can educate the public who votes for

40:25.688 --> 40:28.846
me or doesn't vote for me that they go, look at that guy, he knows

40:28.878 --> 40:32.166
more about it. We trust him. But there are many times I don't feel that

40:32.188 --> 40:36.454
way. But that's a me issue. David Robinson I

40:36.492 --> 40:38.726
thought there was going to be a question at the end of all that for

40:38.748 --> 40:41.894
the there is. Sounded like he might want to refer to my favorite architect.

40:41.942 --> 40:45.498
Did you have anything you wanted to respond to? The chair the only response that

40:45.504 --> 40:49.066
I would give is that we follow the

40:49.088 --> 40:53.294
protocol. We follow the rules in preparing the budget and providing information.

40:53.492 --> 40:57.374
If you would like a different format, if you would like to

40:57.412 --> 41:01.054
expand the scope of the information, we'd be happy to provide

41:01.092 --> 41:05.066
it. We're not looking to in any way shelter or restrict

41:05.098 --> 41:08.658
information. We're just following the program here. Right.

41:08.744 --> 41:11.806
And I think, Chair, that's part of the reason I wanted to hear that preliminary

41:11.838 --> 41:15.586
answer, because frankly, my line of questioning was along some of the lines

41:15.618 --> 41:18.966
you've pursued. And I've been fortunate enough to

41:18.988 --> 41:22.390
travel with Director Diaz to some points

41:22.460 --> 41:25.618
with mayoral delegations in South America.

41:25.714 --> 41:29.794
We've passed through I've passed through not with you, but Ecuador,

41:29.922 --> 41:33.706
Costa Rica. You've mentioned some of the investments that we have in the portfolio of

41:33.728 --> 41:37.642
airports that we've assisted with globally. And it is really

41:37.696 --> 41:41.786
something for us to be very proud about. And Director

41:41.818 --> 41:45.390
Diaz, I think that is something that I share the Chair's interest

41:45.460 --> 41:49.466
in knowing more and understanding about, but understanding

41:49.498 --> 41:52.914
that that's outside of the budget, that you have

41:52.952 --> 41:55.970
to operate your department.

41:56.550 --> 41:59.778
That's kind of where I wanted to see if I

41:59.784 --> 42:03.042
could take a moment and get your feedback on the

42:03.096 --> 42:06.178
extra budgetary issues

42:06.264 --> 42:10.214
that I've heard you talk about already today. There are

42:10.252 --> 42:13.506
capital improvements that are going on at all three airport

42:13.538 --> 42:17.414
spaces in the city of Houston right now. That's not what you use to

42:17.452 --> 42:20.682
run your department on an annual basis, and it's really

42:20.736 --> 42:24.842
not what's in our budget. And I'm thinking about how

42:24.976 --> 42:29.014
we, with your help, could get to a better understanding

42:29.062 --> 42:32.814
how some of those capital improvements go on concurrently while

42:32.852 --> 42:35.902
you're running an airport system. And if you follow me,

42:35.956 --> 42:39.246
this is where the things that the Chair and I

42:39.268 --> 42:43.454
have been on the news along with you recently are

42:43.492 --> 42:46.506
problems, whether it's congestion at the airport that you've

42:46.538 --> 42:50.334
addressed with questions from Council today. I think I was

42:50.372 --> 42:54.426
recently interrogated for why there weren't enough bathrooms

42:54.458 --> 42:57.814
open. Did they interrogated? I think I did. And so the

42:57.852 --> 43:01.586
fact that you didn't have enough bathrooms open became something that apparently

43:01.618 --> 43:05.154
I should have known about. And I do care about the architecture

43:05.202 --> 43:08.534
that you're investing in. And you know as well as I do that I've

43:08.582 --> 43:12.314
had some serious questions for your design team, but that

43:12.352 --> 43:16.074
is, again, extra curricular for

43:16.112 --> 43:19.450
you. And as the director who I feel is the most

43:19.520 --> 43:23.166
scrutinized, the most audited, and perhaps the most

43:23.348 --> 43:26.654
or the least understood, I wonder if you could shed some

43:26.692 --> 43:30.286
light on the separation of those basic components of

43:30.308 --> 43:31.680
what you do every day.

43:36.710 --> 43:40.500
I'm the chief executive for this organization called the Houston Airport System.

43:41.270 --> 43:44.546
And right now, as I said, I'm very happy to

43:44.568 --> 43:47.990
have Jim Sesniak, who is now the chief operating officer.

43:49.130 --> 43:50.840
Jim made a very good point.

43:51.930 --> 43:53.830
We had our enterprise meeting,

43:54.570 --> 43:58.294
quarterly enterprise meeting with the entire organization.

43:58.422 --> 44:02.102
He made a really interesting point that the CEO

44:02.166 --> 44:06.822
focuses on the organization and the CEO operates

44:06.886 --> 44:10.306
within the organization. So Jim's responsibly

44:10.358 --> 44:14.606
enrolled will be on the operational side because

44:14.788 --> 44:20.430
the capital side of this organization

44:21.090 --> 44:24.514
is as large or not larger than the

44:24.552 --> 44:28.740
operational side. When you really start to think about and again,

44:29.270 --> 44:32.866
you'll see some videos. Last night we lifted in

44:32.888 --> 44:37.266
place a section of truss that was 120ft

44:37.298 --> 44:40.534
in length that was brought in

44:40.572 --> 44:44.306
on one of those bogeys that was erected,

44:44.418 --> 44:47.906
actually put in place right outside the airport because it couldn't

44:47.938 --> 44:51.882
be transported. And we brought it in on 11:00 at night.

44:51.936 --> 44:55.546
They started and they finished at 03:00 in the morning. Lifting this

44:55.568 --> 44:59.242
thing by huge cranes and putting it in place. This is not

44:59.296 --> 45:02.926
a small operation. It takes a lot of attention to

45:02.948 --> 45:05.840
details. Councilman, as you know,

45:06.370 --> 45:10.090
when it comes to design, you talk about design management.

45:10.250 --> 45:13.546
I've been the design manager with your assistance,

45:13.658 --> 45:16.914
and we've taken a look, and I have rejected many,

45:16.952 --> 45:20.386
many designs, many, many proposals. I've said, no, that's not what we

45:20.408 --> 45:23.742
want. We want something better. I have pushed the designers.

45:23.806 --> 45:27.174
I've put them in competition with one another, and they've come up with a

45:27.212 --> 45:31.142
phenomenal design for that terminal build. I think when this thing

45:31.276 --> 45:34.918
next year, hopefully you will all come out for

45:35.004 --> 45:38.298
the ribbon cutting for the Dwest Pier. You're going to see a

45:38.304 --> 45:42.330
pier that is the first installment of a terminal

45:42.670 --> 45:46.474
that you've never seen the likes of in this city. It's just

45:46.512 --> 45:50.358
going to be beautiful. Absolutely and absolutely functional,

45:50.454 --> 45:54.142
because we really want to pump a lot of traffic through there. Now,

45:54.276 --> 45:58.186
having said that, I also have to focus on the finance

45:58.298 --> 46:01.882
and I've got to focus on the business and chiefly

46:01.946 --> 46:05.402
the negotiations with the airlines, because that's the difficult

46:05.476 --> 46:08.786
part. Over the course of

46:08.808 --> 46:12.750
my career, I've learned that you don't go into the office of a CEO

46:12.830 --> 46:16.614
and say, hey, we want you to come to Houston or to Atlanta or to

46:16.652 --> 46:19.080
New York. Well, New York is different.

46:20.330 --> 46:25.446
Houston or Atlanta, and we want you to provide service and

46:25.468 --> 46:28.934
you want to show them photos, because what they say to me is,

46:28.972 --> 46:32.380
mario, those photos are really nice. What's the cost?

46:33.950 --> 46:37.626
What's the increase going to be? How much assurance can

46:37.648 --> 46:40.710
you give me about the control of costs in your airport?

46:40.870 --> 46:44.240
What's the market? How's your economy going?

46:44.610 --> 46:48.042
And you've got to be able to answer all those questions. So as the CEO,

46:48.106 --> 46:52.080
I need to take on that role. And it's difficult.

46:52.610 --> 46:56.354
It's something that it's not a five day

46:56.392 --> 46:59.746
a week, nine to five job. It's a day a

46:59.768 --> 47:03.810
week job. It is.

47:03.960 --> 47:07.790
And thank you for that. And that's why we try and our responsibility

47:07.870 --> 47:11.222
is to direct everything to you, not to them.

47:11.356 --> 47:14.374
As a board of directors, sort of for the city, we have to go right

47:14.412 --> 47:18.186
to you and we hold you accountable. We don't want to go to

47:18.208 --> 47:21.850
your people. So this is our big chance to

47:21.920 --> 47:25.738
get an opportunity to do that. Council member tarsha Jackson thank you,

47:25.904 --> 47:29.354
chair. Thank you. And my

47:29.392 --> 47:33.114
colleague, what he just mentioned, that trying to understand the airport and their

47:33.152 --> 47:36.846
budget. I mean, airport is in district b. And so it's been a challenge for

47:36.868 --> 47:40.366
me trying to understand your operation. And so I would love to just

47:40.388 --> 47:43.566
spend more time with you guys so that I can just be

47:43.588 --> 47:47.098
able to represent my constituents better. And so

47:47.204 --> 47:50.210
hopefully we can do that soon in the future. But I do have a question

47:50.280 --> 47:54.082
about the ARPA dollars. You mentioned that you give the ARPA dollars

47:54.136 --> 47:57.986
to airlines. And I'm just trying to understand that. Do the airlines

47:58.018 --> 48:01.494
apply for ARPA dollars themselves? No, we did

48:01.532 --> 48:05.314
all the applications as the city of Houston, department of aviation,

48:05.362 --> 48:10.394
houston airport system, and all

48:10.512 --> 48:14.458
of the cares act, the Chris act,

48:14.544 --> 48:18.442
and the ARP act dollars were provided to us

48:18.576 --> 48:22.414
by formula generally. The formula is

48:22.532 --> 48:26.410
that there's a pot that the federal government has available for airports,

48:26.570 --> 48:29.854
and you will get the proportionate share of that

48:29.892 --> 48:33.746
pot relative or related to the proportionate share that

48:33.768 --> 48:37.010
your airport in terms of passengers,

48:37.590 --> 48:41.394
represents to the total passengers across the country. And that

48:41.432 --> 48:44.580
percentage we get, we've done pretty well.

48:44.950 --> 48:47.974
And then the question is, well, how do you use it? And you remember during

48:48.012 --> 48:51.366
the depths of the pandemic, one of the questions that

48:51.388 --> 48:55.670
came up was how do we help the airlines, how do we help the concessionnaires?

48:56.810 --> 49:00.390
And you can see in the Krisa act, there's actually

49:00.460 --> 49:04.074
a line item out for crystal concessions. And this is money

49:04.112 --> 49:07.498
that we were to pass on. We couldn't keep it. This money that we had

49:07.504 --> 49:10.922
to pass on for the concession years, which we did, which is about 24

49:11.056 --> 49:14.446
actually, total of $30 million. And then the rest of the

49:14.468 --> 49:18.218
money, it's a question, we could use it for any lawful purpose

49:18.314 --> 49:21.614
of the airport system. And we decided that one of the

49:21.652 --> 49:25.198
best use of that money was to help our airline partners to the tune

49:25.214 --> 49:28.594
of about $92 million. But that's it. Now we move

49:28.632 --> 49:32.126
forward and we're spending the rest to carry our contracts,

49:32.238 --> 49:36.258
our sky train parking contracts, manage those,

49:36.344 --> 49:39.638
use that money for those, and then of course to write down

49:39.724 --> 49:43.574
the debt service so that we get to a net debt service payment

49:43.692 --> 49:47.998
that we can very well afford. Okay. Council member Cayman.

49:48.194 --> 49:51.558
Thank you Chair. And to Council Member Robinson's

49:51.574 --> 49:55.498
point, I appreciate that perspective, right minutiae of the

49:55.504 --> 49:58.874
day to day versus overseeing all that you

49:58.912 --> 50:03.070
are overseeing, which is again, not just our airports

50:03.570 --> 50:07.354
and not just global expansion, but galactic

50:07.402 --> 50:10.826
expansion, for lack of a better word. So I appreciate

50:10.858 --> 50:15.118
you, I've never known you to be anything but responsive

50:15.294 --> 50:18.814
directly to me, to staff, your staff included.

50:18.862 --> 50:22.674
So again, I just want to recognize how far

50:22.712 --> 50:26.162
we've come and the instrumental nature in which our airports play.

50:26.216 --> 50:29.958
Again, it's under economic development because of all the things we're doing,

50:30.044 --> 50:33.334
without the airports, we can't bring people in. So just wanted

50:33.372 --> 50:37.238
to recognize that. If I might, just one last point that

50:37.244 --> 50:40.300
I would make. It's not about me.

50:41.070 --> 50:44.726
As I mentioned at the groundbreaking ceremony,

50:44.918 --> 50:48.054
I might be the idea guy, I might be the strategist,

50:48.102 --> 50:51.606
I might be the visionary, but it's these individuals

50:51.638 --> 50:54.906
and the entire 1100 members of the Houston airport

50:54.938 --> 50:58.174
system that make happen what has

50:58.212 --> 51:01.790
happened to this point. And I'm really, really proud of them. They're the ones

51:01.860 --> 51:05.226
that get the job done. Thank you. Council Member Sally

51:05.258 --> 51:08.898
Alcorn. Thank you Chair. And I think you addressed most of this in

51:08.904 --> 51:12.386
your response to Council Member Jackson. I appreciate you having slide twelve in

51:12.408 --> 51:16.014
here to talk about the Krisa and the ARPA and the Cares funding.

51:16.142 --> 51:19.846
And I think I heard you say I was going to ask and I'm always

51:19.868 --> 51:23.346
blown away by when he just blows a billion dollars in reserves.

51:23.378 --> 51:26.886
I mean it was a billion dollars in reserves before the Pandemic. It's a

51:26.908 --> 51:31.030
billion dollars in reserves now because

51:31.100 --> 51:34.586
of this money. Correct? That's pretty much it.

51:34.768 --> 51:38.250
And then this 162,000,000 left,

51:38.320 --> 51:42.178
I think you said you're paying down debt with it and honoring

51:42.214 --> 51:45.834
some contracts and we'll be covering the parking contract.

51:45.882 --> 51:49.722
It's about $30 million. And then there's the sky train contract

51:49.786 --> 51:52.986
as well that we will be covered. Okay. And then that's

51:53.018 --> 51:55.780
the end of and then that's the end. Got it. Thank you.

51:56.470 --> 52:00.206
So of the $207,000,000 of debt,

52:00.238 --> 52:02.690
how much is that is related to itrip?

52:03.670 --> 52:07.442
Very little. Very little. What is that mostly related now? We only, I think,

52:07.496 --> 52:11.190
in 2021, we fixed out about 265,000,000.

52:11.260 --> 52:14.722
That is, we transferred it from commercial paper to bonds.

52:14.866 --> 52:18.406
And I think the interest rate on those was three and a half to 4%.

52:18.508 --> 52:21.898
So there's not a lot. As a matter of fact, one of the things that

52:21.904 --> 52:25.866
we will need to do again, from wearing the financial hat is this

52:25.968 --> 52:29.526
summer and into fall, we will be undertaking a financial

52:29.558 --> 52:32.890
feasibility study. Because sometime between now

52:32.960 --> 52:36.938
and February of next year, we will need to be back into the capital markets

52:37.034 --> 52:40.542
to draw down and fix out the commercial paper

52:40.596 --> 52:44.046
that we spent today. We've got $350,000,000 of commercial paper.

52:44.148 --> 52:48.606
We need to unload that, fix it, and then secure

52:48.638 --> 52:51.822
another $350,000,000 to finish out the financing

52:51.886 --> 52:55.858
for itrip. So I would say that by the end of, let's say

52:56.024 --> 53:00.150
June, July of 2024, we will have fixed out and again, the total

53:00.220 --> 53:04.710
amount in terms of bonds is likely to be about $750,000,000.

53:04.780 --> 53:08.666
Total bonds, total cost of I trip will be 1.3

53:08.688 --> 53:13.174
billion. 1.3. Right. Okay. And expected

53:13.222 --> 53:15.898
completion date June July of 2024.

53:15.904 --> 53:18.698
2024. Yes.

53:18.864 --> 53:22.990
And no other council members give me my last question. I know that always

53:23.060 --> 53:26.638
tell people, if Houston Airport was a

53:26.804 --> 53:30.494
company into itself, it'd be a Fortune 500 company. It's that big. It's a money

53:30.532 --> 53:33.634
making machine. Billion dollars in

53:33.672 --> 53:38.020
liquidity. Right. It's a very successful business,

53:38.950 --> 53:42.178
but yet we're still the city of Houston. And I understand

53:42.264 --> 53:45.714
recently good to have Jim here, but I understand we lost a

53:45.832 --> 53:48.450
COO. I understand we lost our CFO.

53:48.610 --> 53:52.290
That's why Ms. Hampton is probably sitting in your ability

53:52.370 --> 53:56.034
to recruit and maintain employees, given the dynamics

53:56.082 --> 54:00.042
of what we have to operate under. So two

54:00.096 --> 54:03.514
things are happening. First is that, as you all know,

54:03.632 --> 54:06.730
the great resignation is affecting us all.

54:06.880 --> 54:10.814
And it's an employee market. Employees are basically calling their

54:10.852 --> 54:14.894
shots. They're establishing what they want in terms not just of pay,

54:15.012 --> 54:18.558
but also the benefits that they're available.

54:18.644 --> 54:22.286
And then some opportunities are opening up. So our

54:22.308 --> 54:25.650
chief commercial officer left to become the

54:25.800 --> 54:29.010
CEO of John Wayne in California.

54:29.430 --> 54:32.498
Let's talk about this for a second, because, again,

54:32.584 --> 54:35.954
building leadership is also part of my job.

54:36.152 --> 54:40.046
We start out with biodari. Baron Biodari,

54:40.158 --> 54:43.522
former COO. He's now managing the world's busiest airport

54:43.586 --> 54:47.154
as the director of Hartsville Jackson Land International.

54:47.282 --> 54:50.474
Lance. Little former CLO. He is

54:50.512 --> 54:54.326
now the managing director, seattle Tacoma.

54:54.358 --> 54:58.246
Right. Okay. I'm sorry. No, I was answering Seattle

54:58.278 --> 55:02.046
Tacoma. Right. Yes. Seattle Tacoma. He was awesome. He is now the managing director of

55:02.068 --> 55:05.946
Seattle Tacoma. We had Ted Kitchens, who was formerly

55:05.978 --> 55:10.330
running Intercontinental. He's running now an airport as executive

55:10.490 --> 55:13.710
just outside of Boston. You have Perry Miller,

55:13.790 --> 55:16.882
who was running manager of Hobby. He's now running

55:16.936 --> 55:20.878
richmond, Virginia. And we now have Charlene

55:20.974 --> 55:24.990
Reynolds, who came in very, very short sprint and is now

55:25.080 --> 55:28.498
managing John Wayne Airport.

55:28.594 --> 55:31.190
And so when it comes to the CFO,

55:32.730 --> 55:36.374
the gentleman walks into my office and says, thank you for

55:36.412 --> 55:40.250
everything you've done. I've learned how to sell

55:40.320 --> 55:43.174
and finance debt in the capital markets.

55:43.302 --> 55:46.922
You got to pay me for that now. I said, wait a minute. We did.

55:47.056 --> 55:52.130
We gave you the education. Yeah, but I've

55:52.150 --> 55:55.502
got a baby coming. I've got a new house. I need more money,

55:55.556 --> 55:59.230
and they've offered me more. I can't match it. And so

55:59.300 --> 56:03.306
we just need to move on, and Leticia

56:03.338 --> 56:05.780
is doing a great job. Thank you. Yes.

56:07.030 --> 56:10.978
I look at you and I would say you're closer to your

56:11.064 --> 56:14.386
end of your career than the beginning of your career. So we're going to be

56:14.408 --> 56:18.118
faced with where does the replacement for Mario Diaz come from?

56:18.284 --> 56:22.166
Is that person internal or external? That's something to discuss on

56:22.188 --> 56:25.718
another day. We have a number of public speakers that want to ask questions,

56:25.804 --> 56:29.894
so thanks for the opportunity to get

56:29.932 --> 56:33.514
into it. We could probably sit here for a couple of hours and talk

56:33.552 --> 56:36.726
about airport because I'm sort of a geek.

56:36.758 --> 56:39.946
I find what you guys and ladies do every day sort of

56:39.968 --> 56:43.914
fascinating and always tell everybody, we'll be down in spaceport

56:43.962 --> 56:47.950
tonight. We have our redistricting meeting at Space Center. And always

56:48.020 --> 56:52.158
tell people, when we moved here in 1990,

56:52.244 --> 56:55.554
hobby was this little bitty sleepy airport to the south of us.

56:55.592 --> 56:59.346
And now it's a huge international airport that wins a

56:59.448 --> 57:03.362
five star international airport that wins great awards 20

57:03.416 --> 57:06.670
years, 30 years from now. Love to envision what spaceport is going to

57:06.680 --> 57:10.726
look like because it's going to change the landscape of that area

57:10.828 --> 57:13.858
with phenomenal engineering jobs and opportunities

57:13.954 --> 57:17.222
and things of that nature. So keep up the good work,

57:17.276 --> 57:20.602
team, and look for bigger and better things

57:20.656 --> 57:24.534
for you in the future. And I would also recognize

57:24.582 --> 57:27.802
Mr. Icken, who's very involved in your operations as well.

57:27.936 --> 57:30.570
Maybe you'd say too much. Right, Mario?

57:31.010 --> 57:34.846
Thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you.

57:34.948 --> 57:40.302
Dismissed. We'll have a couple of oh,

57:40.356 --> 57:44.194
by the way, council member Robert Gay goes joined us and

57:44.232 --> 57:45.570
now has another meeting.

57:50.070 --> 57:53.250
Mr. Jason Oliver, I think, will be joining us virtually.

57:54.470 --> 57:58.470
Star six. Yes. Good afternoon.

57:59.370 --> 58:03.750
I'm really appreciative of the art I'm seeing throughout the airports, especially local

58:03.820 --> 58:07.126
artists. I was in IH last week, and there's one

58:07.148 --> 58:11.002
artist, Kane Smith, whose tapestry doesn't have a nameplate. It's a small

58:11.056 --> 58:14.426
thing, but I just want to know who to contact to make sure

58:14.528 --> 58:18.634
that's addressed, because I think it's important people know the artists whose work

58:18.672 --> 58:21.854
they're seeing. And then I guess this question is

58:21.972 --> 58:24.830
toward Council Member Martin.

58:25.330 --> 58:28.718
Many of us are really concerned about the procedural change,

58:28.804 --> 58:32.414
removing the public's opportunity to speak publicly to city staff during

58:32.452 --> 58:36.142
these budget workshops. This is not consistent with previous

58:36.206 --> 58:39.906
years and is now our only opportunity to do so after the

58:39.928 --> 58:43.426
committee meeting. Policy change during the pandemic, which I hope will

58:43.448 --> 58:47.294
also be reversed this change midway is a significant inconvenience

58:47.342 --> 58:50.626
for those of us taking time out of our work day to participate.

58:50.738 --> 58:54.194
It seems like this was your decision. Are you willing to resume

58:54.242 --> 58:57.174
the normal policy that we started this budget cycle with?

58:57.292 --> 59:01.174
And if not, please explain why public participation is being directly

59:01.222 --> 59:04.650
undermined this year. Thank you for your comments.

59:06.430 --> 59:09.180
If public speaker has any questions,

59:09.950 --> 59:14.126
the appropriate process is for those questions to be submitted to Share

59:14.308 --> 59:18.400
Point under your name through your council member. Thank you.

59:18.930 --> 59:22.142
Now, that was a question to you, Council Member Martin. Well,

59:22.196 --> 59:24.640
Jason, I just answered it,

59:27.010 --> 59:30.910
so that's enough. Next speaker,

59:31.070 --> 59:33.170
we have Miss Sava Blanding.

59:38.200 --> 59:41.488
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

59:41.584 --> 59:45.556
City council members. Last night, I had a conversation with

59:45.578 --> 59:48.852
my husband about the day's budget hearing, as one does,

59:48.906 --> 59:51.972
and I asked him how he would have responded, and he said,

59:52.106 --> 59:55.256
I would have asked, what are you afraid of? He commented on how there were

59:55.278 --> 59:58.292
only seven constituents asking questions about HPD.

59:58.436 --> 1:00:01.944
Yesterday, the first department finished 14 minutes ahead of time.

1:00:02.142 --> 1:00:05.336
If time was really an issue, it is upon the council to keep everyone to

1:00:05.358 --> 1:00:09.288
time. However, there were at least three to four repeat questions about Mowing schedules.

1:00:09.384 --> 1:00:12.584
In the middle of Rush public testimony, there was an unrushed conversation

1:00:12.632 --> 1:00:16.488
with another Houston Police Department employee. This is not about time.

1:00:16.594 --> 1:00:19.936
To have given public speakers a full three minutes would have only

1:00:19.958 --> 1:00:23.436
added 14 minutes, which the General Services Department's

1:00:23.468 --> 1:00:27.152
punctuality provided. Why is the public not allowed more time?

1:00:27.286 --> 1:00:30.608
What would those 14 minutes have cost the city, other than at least a humble

1:00:30.624 --> 1:00:34.208
nod to democracy? Regarding the airports,

1:00:34.304 --> 1:00:37.968
what are plans to improve public transit to access the airports?

1:00:38.064 --> 1:00:41.992
And what are efforts to include and promote more local businesses in the airport system,

1:00:42.046 --> 1:00:44.680
such as local restaurants and local retailers?

1:00:45.740 --> 1:00:47.320
Thank you. Ms. Blandy.

1:00:48.460 --> 1:00:50.056
Mr. Oliver had a question.

1:00:50.158 --> 1:00:54.520
1.75% of all of our vertical construction

1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:57.980
dollars go to the arts within that facility.

1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:01.948
So percentage 1.75% of the total

1:01:02.034 --> 1:01:05.772
vertical spend goes to the arts

1:01:05.836 --> 1:01:09.420
within an airport. Your pictures,

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:13.040
paintings, different types of things. Council Member Ed Pollard.

1:01:13.620 --> 1:01:16.450
Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Ms. Blanning, for coming. Again,

1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:21.536
trying to get clarification on your statement

1:01:21.728 --> 1:01:25.524
question, as it pertains to

1:01:25.562 --> 1:01:28.868
the what are you scared? Part, is that directed towards

1:01:28.954 --> 1:01:31.990
council, as in why we aren't allowing more time?

1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:35.720
Yeah, I mean, I understand time is an issue,

1:01:35.790 --> 1:01:38.984
and nobody loves punctuality more than me.

1:01:39.022 --> 1:01:42.008
If I'm running a minute, a meeting is going to be like, 15 minutes.

1:01:42.094 --> 1:01:46.136
But we got 14 extra minutes because General Services Department was punctual.

1:01:46.328 --> 1:01:49.612
And then it felt like I was watching people

1:01:49.666 --> 1:01:53.212
run out the clock because there were literally three to four questions that were exactly

1:01:53.266 --> 1:01:56.840
the same about Mowing schedules. And then when it came to public comment

1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:00.092
and we're taking time out of our day, it's 1 minute.

1:02:00.156 --> 1:02:03.216
We're rushed, we're not given answers, and we're told just to submit it.

1:02:03.238 --> 1:02:06.496
What's the point of this? We're supposed to be

1:02:06.518 --> 1:02:08.470
a democracy. Well,

1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:13.140
I appreciate your comments. I think the main reason for everything

1:02:13.210 --> 1:02:17.044
is to get the public clarification on any questions that you

1:02:17.082 --> 1:02:20.340
may have. And sometimes the questions

1:02:20.490 --> 1:02:23.624
and the answers go above the time that

1:02:23.662 --> 1:02:27.304
we reasonably have. So we have the process in place

1:02:27.342 --> 1:02:31.060
that if the questions and answers aren't provided in a timely manner,

1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:34.420
then you can submit those questions. Because at the end of the day,

1:02:34.510 --> 1:02:37.980
as constituents, you all have rights to know any

1:02:38.050 --> 1:02:42.220
answer to any question that you may have. And so if the point

1:02:42.290 --> 1:02:45.672
is to ensure that you get the questions answered,

1:02:45.816 --> 1:02:48.864
then we have that ability to do

1:02:48.902 --> 1:02:52.016
that. And so I don't want to get caught up too

1:02:52.038 --> 1:02:55.792
much in the different systems and process, because we all may have different

1:02:55.846 --> 1:02:59.896
opinions and perspectives on that. But if your end goal

1:02:59.948 --> 1:03:03.396
is to ensure that you have more information and

1:03:03.498 --> 1:03:07.316
more clarity based on the questions that you may have, then we do

1:03:07.338 --> 1:03:10.970
everything we can as a council to provide those answers to you.

1:03:14.670 --> 1:03:16.860
Council Member Jackson. Okay.

1:03:18.350 --> 1:03:22.026
Yes. Thank you. Saba I mean, that was one of my questions,

1:03:22.128 --> 1:03:26.010
was we have the airport here in the police department.

1:03:26.750 --> 1:03:29.806
They should be able to answer the constituents questions. I would want to get my

1:03:29.828 --> 1:03:33.150
questions answered. If I'm sitting here in this chamber,

1:03:33.650 --> 1:03:38.450
I would like to get the questions answered. So I would like to understand why

1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:42.082
isn't that possible? Can we next year schedule these

1:03:42.136 --> 1:03:46.190
hearings for the workshops? An hour. Each department

1:03:46.270 --> 1:03:49.518
spend an hour to give people time to get their answers.

1:03:49.694 --> 1:03:53.286
I'll let you get their questions answered. You and come while I go through

1:03:53.308 --> 1:03:56.582
the next and you all can discuss it back there

1:03:56.636 --> 1:04:00.994
away from the public. That's not appropriate for the public. We'll have Mr. Broder butler

1:04:01.042 --> 1:04:04.140
next. Or I'll join you back there.

1:04:10.620 --> 1:04:14.408
Good afternoon. I have no direct

1:04:14.494 --> 1:04:17.588
questions at this point in time in regards to the airport.

1:04:17.684 --> 1:04:21.164
I think that the Houston Airport does an

1:04:21.202 --> 1:04:24.636
above average job. In other words, it's not exemplary. But I am

1:04:24.658 --> 1:04:27.916
very proud of my airport. I've gone through many in this country.

1:04:28.098 --> 1:04:31.776
But I do have just one concern, and now

1:04:31.798 --> 1:04:35.244
I am getting to a question. I'm from Northeast Houston,

1:04:35.292 --> 1:04:38.412
and I would like since Houston first is an initiative,

1:04:38.556 --> 1:04:42.320
everything about this city is an initiative. I would like to have asked

1:04:42.390 --> 1:04:45.108
the director, who is on the other side of the door and probably on the

1:04:45.114 --> 1:04:48.692
fourth floor now, what would he do? Or could he put a

1:04:48.746 --> 1:04:52.052
program together to make sure that since his

1:04:52.106 --> 1:04:54.996
airport is in District B, where I come from,

1:04:55.098 --> 1:04:58.904
that he puts a program together to try to get employees that

1:04:58.942 --> 1:05:02.552
live within a ten to 15 miles radius of his

1:05:02.606 --> 1:05:06.868
airport to increase on time, to increase his workforce?

1:05:07.044 --> 1:05:10.524
But I don't get a chance to answer that question because he

1:05:10.562 --> 1:05:13.884
talked about being a visionary. He talked about doing things that would

1:05:13.922 --> 1:05:17.612
build up this city. And unfortunately, unless somebody

1:05:17.666 --> 1:05:21.356
else can ask me about the vision of the director of the airports about

1:05:21.458 --> 1:05:24.992
hiring practices, I can't get that answer.

1:05:25.126 --> 1:05:28.880
So he puts on a program twice a year. I believe it is

1:05:28.950 --> 1:05:32.172
out in that area because I live a little bit north of you

1:05:32.326 --> 1:05:35.936
and I forgot what he calls it. But it's

1:05:35.968 --> 1:05:40.192
an opportunity for prospective employer groups

1:05:40.256 --> 1:05:43.428
that want to work for the airport to understand a little bit

1:05:43.514 --> 1:05:47.784
more about that process and also the MWBE process

1:05:47.902 --> 1:05:52.276
that should help those types of businesses, also individuals

1:05:52.308 --> 1:05:55.576
who are looking for opportunities as well. So he does do

1:05:55.598 --> 1:05:58.984
that in conjunction with a number

1:05:59.022 --> 1:06:02.652
of folks within his airport. And I don't know where they are today

1:06:02.706 --> 1:06:06.364
with it, but I'll try and find out because it just reminded me

1:06:06.482 --> 1:06:10.092
because of COVID we haven't had many of those opportunities.

1:06:10.156 --> 1:06:13.936
But it would happen literally twice a year that

1:06:13.958 --> 1:06:17.410
he would put on a convocave that

1:06:18.660 --> 1:06:22.828
had those opportunities for individuals as well as businesses

1:06:22.924 --> 1:06:26.044
in particular in that area. Well, thank you for the answer.

1:06:26.102 --> 1:06:29.588
With all due respect, the marketing of that doesn't get out to the

1:06:29.594 --> 1:06:33.184
basic level of people. But I would also like to extend

1:06:33.232 --> 1:06:37.620
an additional request, if you could ask him if funds allow, if time allows,

1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:41.064
that he can increase it from two to four. In other words,

1:06:41.262 --> 1:06:44.616
create a bigger net to cast more people. Because at this point

1:06:44.638 --> 1:06:47.816
in time, using this great resignation,

1:06:48.008 --> 1:06:51.196
you still got to bake the donuts, right? Do me

1:06:51.218 --> 1:06:53.708
a favor. Send my district email,

1:06:53.794 --> 1:06:57.484
district e at houstontx. Gov an

1:06:57.522 --> 1:07:01.464
address so I have your email address and I will copy

1:07:01.592 --> 1:07:05.500
you on the email I send to Mario Diaz asking that particular question.

1:07:05.570 --> 1:07:08.776
One last note. You have a very exemplary staff every time I've interacted

1:07:08.808 --> 1:07:12.660
with them. It's been a pleasure. Well, thank you for saying that. And there's

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.910
one of them sitting right here and I agree with you.

1:07:19.610 --> 1:07:22.580
That concludes public speakers for Houston Airport system.
