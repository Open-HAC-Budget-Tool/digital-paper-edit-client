1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,910
Next we'll have the Office of Fleet Management.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,726
Keep looking around the room for Jack Christie for this one, but I don't think

3
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:24,670
he's here's.

4
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,010
I'd like to welcome Director Gary Glask

5
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,802
and Mr. Ray Cruz. Good afternoon.

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,162
My name is Gary Glaskok, and I'm the director of the Fleet Management

7
00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:39,814
Department. I'll be presenting the department's proposed operating

8
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:42,620
budget for fiscal year 2023.

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,198
Along with me is Ray Cruz of the Finance Department.

10
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:49,494
Ray serves as the Chief Financial Officer

11
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:52,960
for Fleet Management. Next slide, please.

12
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,914
I'll start with some department information for reference purposes.

13
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:02,106
Our mission is to provide the City of Houston with best value fleet

14
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:06,126
management services. We operate 27 maintenance garages

15
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:09,666
and 67 refueling sites to service a little more

16
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:12,946
than 13,700 vehicles and pieces of

17
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:15,060
equipment. Next slide, please.

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,546
Fleet Management is a revolving fund department.

19
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:24,358
Our proposed operating budget for fiscal year 2023

20
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:29,580
is $98,930,411.

21
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,994
This budget will provide for a little more than 381

22
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:37,482
full time positions that are deployed within five

23
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,926
different programs. The first of these programs is

24
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:44,122
the Director's Office, which handles the strategic planning,

25
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:47,870
policy making and personnel administration for the department.

26
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,074
The budget of the Director's Office covers restricted account charges

27
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:55,582
by other city departments, including Human Resources,

28
00:01:55,726 --> 00:02:00,050
Finance and Hits. Our Operation division

29
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,046
performs the maintenance work in the garages and oversees

30
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,294
the repair work done by our contractors. 61% of

31
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:11,574
the total Fleet Management budget is allocated to the

32
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:14,498
operations program to cover the cost of labor,

33
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:17,480
spare parts and contracted services.

34
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,414
The Fuel Management Group oversees fuel,

35
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:24,886
inventories and service station maintenance. Their budget

36
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:28,970
pays for the gasoline and diesel used by city vehicles.

37
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,882
Our Customer Service Division handles the distribution of replacement parts,

38
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,466
our material and services contracts, as well as our motor

39
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:41,114
pool or fleet share. The customer service budget

40
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:44,046
is largely driven by labor costs.

41
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:47,582
And then finally, our Asset Management Division oversees

42
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:50,894
capital, program, vehicle, onboarding tracking

43
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:54,510
and eventual disposal. They also manage our data collection

44
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,406
system as well as our reporting systems. In addition to

45
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,162
labor costs, the asset management budget covers software,

46
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:04,914
maintenance and related expenses. Next slide,

47
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:08,694
please. This slide

48
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:13,014
provides historical reference for our proposed budget and major expense categories.

49
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:16,666
Again, we are a revolving fund department, so the

50
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:20,550
listed values reflect both our revenues and expenses.

51
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,902
In the top table, you'll see that we're proposing a $3.9

52
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:28,282
million or 4.2% increase in operating expenses

53
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:31,454
compared to current year. Moving down

54
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:35,134
to the expense category table, our personnel expenses

55
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,434
are increasing by 3.6%, while the cost

56
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:42,162
of supplies is going up $1.8 million or

57
00:03:42,216 --> 00:03:45,618
9%. We're seeing a 1%

58
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:49,442
increase in restricted account charges as well as an increase

59
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:53,154
of $535,000 for contracted

60
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:56,838
services. And I'll provide a little more detail on these increases a

61
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:59,580
little later in the presentation. Next slide, please.

62
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,546
Here's a graphical representation on how the funding of our

63
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:08,794
proposed budget is being allocated. Labor is

64
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,286
the largest slice of the pie at 37% of total,

65
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:15,994
followed by fuel at 25% and parts.

66
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:19,662
At 16%, we plan to spend roughly $9

67
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:23,682
million on Outsider Contracted Services and

68
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:26,690
$5.6 million on tires.

69
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,166
The $4.1 million slice of pie labeled Other Restricted

70
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:34,894
accounts includes what we pay other city departments for their

71
00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:39,154
services. And finally, the 3 million in the other miscellaneous

72
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:42,354
expenses will fund items such as office supplies,

73
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,994
employee uniforms, diagnostic software and tools.

74
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:48,460
Next slide, please.

75
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,274
Fleet Management receives revenues from our client departments to

76
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:58,342
cover their fuel and vehicle maintenance expenses.

77
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:02,302
Roughly 74 million in revenue will be sourced from the general fund

78
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:06,346
departments, while 23 million is expected from the departments

79
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:10,014
that operate with enterprise funds. Another 2.8

80
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:13,490
million will come from special grants and funds.

81
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,010
Next slide.

82
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,174
This table lists the expenditure changes included in the proposed budget

83
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,954
compared to current year. In the top section of the table, you'll see that our

84
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,934
operating budget for fiscal year 22 is $94.9 million.

85
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:34,594
This amount includes a $4.6 million

86
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:38,170
adjustment that was made to cover fuel price increases.

87
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,794
The middle section of the table highlights the significant adjustments of

88
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:46,426
the proposed fiscal year 23 budget. All of

89
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:49,890
the increases are limited to contractual or mandated

90
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,386
adjustments. The sum of these adjustments results

91
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:56,954
in the 4.2% budget increase compared

92
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:59,440
to current year. Next slide, please.

93
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,786
Here's some additional detail on the budget adjustments of the

94
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:08,622
previous slide. Personnel costs are going up approximately

95
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:12,382
$997,000 due to the Hope salary

96
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:16,360
increase along with the rising costs of health and pension benefits.

97
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,094
Our headcount for fiscal year 23 actually drops by

98
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:24,706
three compared to current year. Fuel expenses

99
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:28,658
go up $240,000. This increases

100
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:31,834
on top of the $4.6 million adjustment that

101
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:34,810
was made to the current year budget for fuel.

102
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,114
A $2 million Escalation for the purchase of parts will

103
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:42,634
cover rising costs resulting from inflation and supply

104
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:46,958
chain issues. We're also increasing the cost of contracted services

105
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:51,514
by $1 million. This adjustment will handle Escalating contractor

106
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:55,810
rates as well as provide us with some additional contracting capacity.

107
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,146
The $379,000 reduction in program

108
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:04,174
expenses is a sum of cuts over multiple budget

109
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:07,786
line items as well as the elimination of onetime

110
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:10,360
expenses that occurred during the current year.

111
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,554
And this concludes the Fleet Management Fiscal Year 2023 budget

112
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,786
presentation. We've got next slide there, but I think we'll

113
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:22,662
skip over it for the sake of time. Really isn't related to the budget,

114
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:25,674
and we'll go to questions. Thank you,

115
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:29,258
Council Member Ed Pollard. Thank you, Chair. I have a couple of

116
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:33,322
questions. First one is from Council Member Michael Kubash,

117
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,830
who's not with us at the moment. His question

118
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,870
is how do we purchase gasoline,

119
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,454
diesel and CNG? Do we buy it

120
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:46,420
each month or is there a contract out for it each year?

121
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,154
We purchase it under contract and we're currently in the third

122
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:54,974
year of the contract. We've got two one year options that

123
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:58,754
are available. The current term

124
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:01,846
ends, I believe it's in September of this year.

125
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:05,682
And that vendor is for all different types of gasoline.

126
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:10,150
No, we've actually got one vendor for gasoline

127
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,450
and another vendor for diesel.

128
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,094
And we actually ride the contract

129
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:20,938
that's owned by Metro. And so Metro's

130
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:24,906
fuel Buying, in addition to the City's fuel buying, provides us with some purchasing

131
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:28,686
leverage. Second question is,

132
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:32,606
last year we had a budget amendment that was put forth that

133
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:36,402
we discussed within BFA that talked about the

134
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:40,050
idea of putting advertisements on city

135
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,730
vehicles as a way to generate revenue. I knew we were doing

136
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,550
maybe a study or an analysis on whether or not that is feasible,

137
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,934
something that would be attractive to the city. Are you familiar with that?

138
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:54,358
Where do we stand on that? I was not involved in those particular

139
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:57,842
discussions, but I can say that at a previous employer,

140
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:01,546
we did take advantage of that particular opportunity and there was

141
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:05,686
some revenue that was generated. Of course, this was using transit

142
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:09,402
buses. So there's a much larger canvas compared to the

143
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:12,894
opportunities that are provided with city vehicles. Chair, did we ever

144
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:16,634
get any feedback on that after we did that BFA meeting

145
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,234
regarding that topic? No, not that I recall.

146
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:23,774
Okay, I'll follow up with you on that. Thank you. This is a quick follow

147
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:27,134
up. The contracts for the gas, diesel and LNG,

148
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:31,070
are they a fixed price or a variable? They're variable price and they're

149
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,802
based on the Platts marketing index. And so our price

150
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:38,434
is relative to whatever that index is doing. So as prices

151
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:42,146
rise we didn't do any hedging. We did not do any hedging,

152
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:45,222
but we are considering it at the moment. In fact,

153
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:49,218
we've had some discussions with both our finance group and legal

154
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:52,906
as well as Metro because they're doing a little hedging right now to see

155
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:55,990
if we can offer the city some protection going that route.

156
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,526
Council member Amy Peck. Thank you. Thank you, Director,

157
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,814
for the presentation. As costs are

158
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,590
increasing for gas, for just maintenance, for everything

159
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,174
related to fleet, how closely are you working with the

160
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:13,886
departments when they're looking at their budgets? Are you telling them, here's what we

161
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:17,806
can expect for increase in costs and then they're doing their budget accordingly?

162
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:21,202
Or are they just kind of left up to determining how much those costs might

163
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:25,242
go up? Yes, we work with the departments regularly

164
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:28,998
and we're actually seeing some unprecedented times.

165
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:32,950
And so we're seeing some really high

166
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,746
increase for the cost of vehicles.

167
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:39,834
We're also seeing high increases for parts, but we're also seeing

168
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:43,482
supply chain issues. And so what used to take six

169
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:47,994
months to get is now taking up to 1824

170
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:51,218
months for delivery. And so what we're asking our departments

171
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:55,342
to do is to focus on the critical vehicles in their shift within

172
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:59,082
their fleet because they're much harder to get compared

173
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:02,394
to previous. And so that's where our attention

174
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:07,198
is at the moment. Thank you. Council Member Sally Alcorn,

175
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:10,498
along those same lines as Council Member Peck, I noticed in the

176
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:14,450
budget book you've got under fuel management there's a decrease,

177
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,230
$3 million in that division.

178
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,080
So I don't know if that's just because of when we

179
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:31,572
were okay,

180
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:35,076
so there was a decrease made relative to

181
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:38,484
the current year budget. My understanding is

182
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:42,228
that based on fuel prices, when we put the budget together,

183
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:46,180
the cost of fuel is actually much less than what it currently

184
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,696
is. We've had a spike since then. Will you probably make an adjustment to

185
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:54,330
this? Because that did catch my eyes when I was looking at the divisions and

186
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,510
how could fuel management be going down in these days?

187
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,164
So we increased the budget by $4.5 million during

188
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:06,888
journal appropriations. So that kind of changed the balance

189
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:10,432
and fuel for next year. So the original budget for fuel was $20 million.

190
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:14,256
We increased it to $24 million, but the FY 23 budget was

191
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:16,690
24 million and change. Okay,

192
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,184
got it. Thank you. Not due to more LNG or

193
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:24,864
electric cars or it's strictly that straight.

194
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:28,336
Okay. Council member, abbey Cayman. Thank you. And Director,

195
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:31,844
thank you for the presentation. I was hoping you wouldn't skip over

196
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:36,100
the last page as it relates to fleet electrification.

197
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,368
Really quickly off the top of your head, where are we

198
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:43,396
in terms of percentage of total fleet moving towards hybrid

199
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:47,240
or electric? In terms of percentage?

200
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,004
Let's see. We're still very small. We're making

201
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:54,316
incremental gains, I should say.

202
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:57,736
Council just approved the purchase of 97 vehicles.

203
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:01,392
We're getting ready to bring another package of roughly ten

204
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:04,720
vehicles within probably

205
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,236
the next month or so. One of the big issues that we're

206
00:13:08,268 --> 00:13:12,288
dealing with when it comes to purchasing electric vehicles

207
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:16,470
is the limited capital budget that's available. And so

208
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,212
as I mentioned earlier, the focus on

209
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:23,924
capital and how we use that capital is on critical

210
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:27,544
equipment. So the bulk of the money is going to

211
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:31,188
police cars, fire trucks, and refuge trucks.

212
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:34,372
Whatever is left over gets allocated

213
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:38,252
to light duty vehicles. And that's where our opportunity is,

214
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:42,252
to fund electric vehicles. Now, what we're working on now

215
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:46,220
is we're trying to take advantage of the current used car market

216
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,112
and sell off as many underutilized city vehicles as

217
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:54,048
possible. We're using those proceeds to buy electric

218
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:57,440
vehicles now. And one of the reasons I'm asking

219
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,828
is, one is fuel continues to increase. We have

220
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:04,884
supply shortages, vehicles that are way

221
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:08,576
beyond their lifespan, and we need to continue to move towards the mayor's

222
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:11,552
goal of a renewable energy fleet.

223
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:15,988
However, I also know that the fire department, during their presentation

224
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:19,556
with their lease program for certain vehicles, is showing

225
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:23,610
improvements in returns on that. Are we considering that for other

226
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,608
parts of the fleet, city of Houston fleet? Yes, ma'am.

227
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:33,292
So, as I mentioned previously, we're in some unprecedented times here.

228
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:37,144
Vehicle costs, as well as the ability to source

229
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:40,544
parts to make repairs. We've got examples of

230
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:44,016
fire trucks that were damaged in accidents earlier this year

231
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:47,964
that are taking a year to 18 months to get repaired simply

232
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:52,150
because parts aren't available. And so

233
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,972
we have to start thinking strategically on how we

234
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:59,968
ensure that our emergency services are sustained.

235
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:04,048
And to that end, on top of that, we're having lots

236
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:07,648
of difficulty, as I've heard the other departments mentioned,

237
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:11,416
recruiting mechanics. And so as we

238
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:15,236
look at our current situation, we being fleet

239
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:18,364
management and our in house personnel focusing on that

240
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:22,120
critical equipment. And we do think there's going to be some opportunities

241
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,852
for increased leasing to help manage what's going

242
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:28,060
on with the light duty vehicles.

243
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,740
Let me back into you. Council Member Carolyn evan Shabaz.

244
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,412
Thank you, Mayor Brutam. Thank you so much for this presentation.

245
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:42,112
I just wanted to ask a question. Have there been any concerns

246
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:45,364
about the theft of catalytic converters? Have any

247
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:50,464
of them been stolen and are there any financial implications involved

248
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:54,392
with protecting them with the fleet? Yes,

249
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:59,796
ma'am. We did have a number of catalytic converters stolen knocking

250
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,672
on wood, but it has been over six to eight

251
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:07,080
months since we've recorded any thefts.

252
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,804
I'm going off of memory here, but I want to say that the city has

253
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:15,132
spent almost $400,000 in making

254
00:16:15,186 --> 00:16:18,540
repairs to those vehicles that were vandalized.

255
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,210
Thank you, council Member Abby Cayman. Thank you,

256
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,512
Director. Do we know how many employees right now are utilizing our fleet share

257
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:31,980
program? I don't have that number. Off the

258
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,412
top of my head, I will say that over the past year,

259
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:39,220
we've worked very hard to get fleet share up. We saw numbers

260
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,560
drop dramatically during the pandemic,

261
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,716
and we're now starting to see an increase.

262
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:50,052
What we've also been doing is for our client departments

263
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:54,036
offering long term fleet share leases to cover their immediate

264
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:57,736
needs. Our purpose is to get as many of

265
00:16:57,758 --> 00:17:01,164
the pool vehicles out in use, because they're not doing

266
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:04,604
anything for the city when they're just sitting. And so I

267
00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:08,140
believe we're up, and I'll get back to you. But I believe

268
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,756
we're at 50% right now, which is

269
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:15,836
an improvement from I think we started somewhere around 30% earlier

270
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,568
this year. But I'll be happy to get those details to you. Thank you.

271
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:22,916
We'll submit all of these questions and a few others just to follow up in

272
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,910
terms of electrification process progress. Thanks,

273
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,788
Director Glascock. We have three public speakers here.

274
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:33,380
Our first will be Jason Oliver.

275
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,520
Good afternoon. Thank you all for the presentation.

276
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,148
I think the first question kind of going along with what Council

277
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:50,852
Member came in, was talking about, what's the kind of plan

278
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:54,064
to budget for electrical vehicle charging

279
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:57,636
infrastructure? I know that's going to be, of course, the electrification of the

280
00:17:57,658 --> 00:18:01,284
vehicles is important, but also the infrastructure for

281
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:05,204
charging is vital as well. Right. So the purchase

282
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,984
of infrastructure to recharge the electric vehicles is made under the

283
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:13,156
capital program. We're also using the proceeds

284
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:16,716
from vehicle sales to buy chargers as well.

285
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:20,812
And so our idea currently is that we are going to need one

286
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:25,340
charger for each electric vehicle that we purchase, at least initially.

287
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,568
Okay. And then the vehicle lease program, what do

288
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:33,376
we know about the environmental impact of that? Because it

289
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:36,512
seems like while it might be cost

290
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:40,036
effective, it has a significant environmental impact that might kind of

291
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:43,300
offset what we're doing with the electrification.

292
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,604
Well, in terms of environmental impact, I would say that

293
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:51,636
the lease program has the same impact as

294
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:55,076
purchasing a new vehicle. And so basically, what we're

295
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:58,280
doing is pulling an older vehicle with

296
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,876
older emissions, a higher emitting vehicle off the street,

297
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:06,460
and replacing it with a newer vehicle. So I guess, in summary,

298
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,696
anytime we can replace an old vehicle, we're improving the environmental

299
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:14,264
impact, even if it's just being bought,

300
00:19:14,312 --> 00:19:17,864
because it's like a year or so, right. With some of these vehicles

301
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:20,770
or the timing, so they won't be that old.

302
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,250
In many cases, we are replacing model year

303
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,684
2000 vehicles with these leases,

304
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:32,400
and those vehicles, when they were built, had much more lenient

305
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,256
emissions requirements compared to current year vehicles.

306
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:39,056
And so just in that switch out alone,

307
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:42,970
we provide for some environmental benefit. Got you. Thank you.

308
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,200
Saba Blanding.

309
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,770
Hey, good afternoon. I have a question

310
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,540
similar to Jason's, just in terms of environmental impact,

311
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,904
fuel consumption appears to be fairly consistent, around 10 million gallons

312
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:04,508
annually. And I'm wondering if you

313
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:08,364
all have any initiatives in place or proposed to significantly

314
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:12,272
decrease fuel consumption. Well, we do. We have

315
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:16,336
the targets of the Climate Action Plan to replace all

316
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:20,064
the non emergency vehicles with electric vehicles

317
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:23,872
by year 2030. And then we also have a vehicle

318
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:28,480
selection criteria we use. So when vehicle

319
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,812
purchases or leases are proposed to our department by

320
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,600
our client departments, we look at a couple of different things.

321
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,824
We look at the application, how the vehicle is being used, and then

322
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,660
we look at the market to see, is there an electric vehicle

323
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,200
available? If there is and it fits in the application,

324
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,720
then we make the decision to purchase that electric vehicle.

325
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,196
If an electric vehicle is not available, then we

326
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,588
look to the market to see if a hybrid vehicle is available.

327
00:20:56,754 --> 00:21:00,284
And if there is, then we'll go hybrid. If we cannot satisfy

328
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:03,728
the application with either an EV or a

329
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:07,280
hybrid, then we purchase the conventional vehicle. Okay.

330
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,140
Thank you, Mr. Bernard Butler.

331
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,460
It's actually broderick like Matthew broderick.

332
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,856
Sorry. Thank you for the presentation.

333
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:30,676
And I don't mean to be critical. With all due respect, it was sobering,

334
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:34,410
but I appreciate the honesty of why

335
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,248
we as citizens walk around and see that Tesla

336
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:43,260
is putting fueling stations

337
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,480
in the HEB in Heights in Montrose.

338
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,908
And it's kind of amazing, right? He's not a city government.

339
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:54,336
He's richest man in the world. But for you

340
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:58,210
to tell me that you're not over 2% because we can't get to

341
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,032
this magical fleet of electric vehicles is very

342
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:06,084
sobering. I would think that the soon to be third largest city in

343
00:22:06,122 --> 00:22:10,432
the country would have been leaps and bounds like Austin

344
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:14,256
or some other place like that. But that's

345
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:17,876
just a statement. I don't expect an answer. But I

346
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:21,956
am very interested in the second part when you said you don't have mechanics.

347
00:22:22,068 --> 00:22:26,120
Well, in northeast Houston, where I am, we have a community college

348
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,608
that we need to have someone have a strategic partnership with

349
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:33,500
to teach young millennials to be actually

350
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,480
mechanics. And not maybe old school mechanics, but mechanics of hybrids

351
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,228
and fuel vehicles. So please give that some consideration going forward,

352
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:45,056
looking down the road. Absolutely. And I might add that,

353
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,704
in fact, we've got our Chief of Staff in the crowd here and we have

354
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,984
made some pretty significant strides in reaching out

355
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:55,040
to community colleges as well as high schools.

356
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,516
The high school mechanic programs have proven to

357
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:01,892
be very productive in finding and

358
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:05,700
recruiting employees. And so we're pressing very hard

359
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,236
with those learning institutions to try to get

360
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:12,616
anything we can to help us out. The only person got to compete with is

361
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:16,164
Chief Pena. He wants to be firemen. But if you get a couple of mechanics

362
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:19,210
out of it, not a problem. Thank you. Thank you.

363
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,960
And thank you, Mr. Glaxcock and Mr. Cruz.

364
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,576
This concludes a Fleet Management Department workshop. So we will

365
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:31,096
now adjourn for a second and begin our

366
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,770
budget workshop up on the Housing Department. Thank you.
