WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:04.954
I'm going to carry on now with our next presentation

00:05.082 --> 00:09.214
for this budget workshop. And now we will shift to

00:09.252 --> 00:12.814
gears to hear from the Mayor's office. And at this time, I would

00:12.852 --> 00:16.522
like to welcome our Chief of staff for the Mayor's office, ms.

00:16.586 --> 00:19.754
Marvelette Hunter and Valerie Barry,

00:19.802 --> 00:23.806
to provide the Mayor's Office department budget presentation. I want

00:23.828 --> 00:26.966
to thank you all for your presentation station and turn the floor to

00:26.988 --> 00:29.638
you. Excellent. Good morning,

00:29.724 --> 00:34.338
chair and council members and council representatives.

00:34.514 --> 00:39.154
I am here today with our CFO, Valerie Berry, and Valerie

00:39.202 --> 00:42.442
has ridden side chair with me for the last six

00:42.496 --> 00:45.834
budget presentations, so really glad that she is here.

00:45.952 --> 00:50.102
We also have several members of the Mayor's office executive team

00:50.176 --> 00:53.614
who are present, and I would like for them to please stand and

00:53.652 --> 00:55.200
be recognized right now.

01:01.170 --> 01:02.400
Thank you all.

01:04.070 --> 01:07.442
I may have a couple of them come forward during

01:07.496 --> 01:10.130
our Q and A time period.

01:10.870 --> 01:14.846
If you have any additional questions that relate to their specific

01:14.968 --> 01:18.706
areas of expertise. After I finish the budget

01:18.898 --> 01:22.360
this year, I'm excited to be able to be here with you in person

01:22.970 --> 01:26.630
instead of virtually, which was our last fate.

01:27.530 --> 01:30.874
We have certainly had our fair share of challenges through this

01:30.912 --> 01:34.506
administration, but just like Houston, we've proven that

01:34.528 --> 01:37.894
we are resilient and that we can come through anything, even a global

01:37.942 --> 01:41.530
pandemic. I'd like to publicly thank the city of Houston

01:41.610 --> 01:45.466
for their support of Mayor Turner and this administration.

01:45.578 --> 01:49.194
And I also want to thank the 22,000 employees

01:49.242 --> 01:52.458
who work tirelessly to serve the citizens

01:52.474 --> 01:56.066
of Houston. Today. I'm pleased to present to

01:56.088 --> 01:59.790
you the FY 23 Mayor's Office proposed budget.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.340
And if we could have our first slide, please.

02:13.540 --> 02:17.632
Here is the Functional organization chart summarizing our six

02:17.766 --> 02:21.492
General fund divisions. First, we have

02:21.546 --> 02:24.688
our executive offices, which includes our boards

02:24.704 --> 02:27.910
and commissions, education,

02:28.280 --> 02:32.212
constituent services, community relations and our council

02:32.276 --> 02:36.216
relations. Next we have our Agenda office,

02:36.398 --> 02:39.530
the Economic Development Office, government relations,

02:40.300 --> 02:43.988
Communications and our Veteran Affairs Office.

02:44.174 --> 02:48.860
You'll note here the total budget for each of the six divisions

02:49.600 --> 02:53.992
as well as the number of FTEs for each of those respective

02:54.056 --> 02:57.570
divisions. Next slide, please.

03:02.900 --> 03:06.444
There are two special revenue funds administered

03:06.492 --> 03:09.952
by the Mayor's office. First, we have our Cable

03:10.016 --> 03:13.184
TV Special Fund, whose functional

03:13.232 --> 03:17.012
organization chart you see before you with the budget and

03:17.066 --> 03:20.420
the number of FTEs that are represented.

03:23.180 --> 03:24.570
Next slide, please.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.504
You'll see here the other special fund, which is

03:30.542 --> 03:33.860
our Tourism and Promotion Special Fund.

03:34.030 --> 03:37.644
And this organizational chart shows the budget and the

03:37.682 --> 03:42.220
FTEs for each of those respective divisions.

03:42.880 --> 03:47.060
The tourism and promotion fund includes our special events,

03:47.240 --> 03:51.760
trade and international affairs, and it also includes cultural affairs.

03:53.540 --> 03:54.850
Next slide, please.

03:57.220 --> 04:01.316
The next four slides are going to share with

04:01.338 --> 04:04.390
you our course services within the Mayor's office.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.816
First we looked at divisions that are mandated by federal

04:08.848 --> 04:12.216
or state statutes or municipal code. And then

04:12.238 --> 04:16.116
we looked at divisions that were created to meet the needs of the citizens

04:16.148 --> 04:19.636
of Houston. Now, although most of our divisions

04:19.668 --> 04:22.200
are not statutorily required,

04:23.020 --> 04:26.684
the citizens of Houston certainly depend on those services that we

04:26.722 --> 04:29.580
provide on a daily basis.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.252
So on this particular slide, you see our Office of Education,

04:34.386 --> 04:38.460
our Boards and commissions and our Constituent Services divisions.

04:38.960 --> 04:42.416
And I just wanted to note just a couple of highlights from each one of

04:42.438 --> 04:45.792
those and the rest is there for your reading but heart

04:45.846 --> 04:50.004
Houston youth. That is one of the Mayor's signature initiatives and that

04:50.042 --> 04:53.924
is administered through our Education Office. And we

04:53.962 --> 04:57.828
are on track currently this year to provide 12,000

04:57.914 --> 05:00.948
jobs for our youth ages 16 to 24.

05:01.034 --> 05:05.076
And I will make note that when that program first started, we were only providing

05:05.108 --> 05:08.196
450 jobs. And now we have brought on the private

05:08.228 --> 05:12.228
sector and all of the additional jobs now are private sector

05:12.324 --> 05:16.460
related. I'll also note that

05:16.530 --> 05:19.884
as far as our Boards and Commissions is concerned, we have,

05:19.922 --> 05:23.516
and many people don't know this, over 160

05:23.618 --> 05:27.472
Boards and Commissions, and that's a lot of people

05:27.526 --> 05:32.012
that we have to administrate over. And then lastly, for Constituent

05:32.076 --> 05:36.720
Services, just making a note that there are approximately 1400

05:36.790 --> 05:40.832
pieces of correspondence that comes in to the Mayor's office on a monthly basis.

05:40.976 --> 05:45.172
And with a very lean staff of two, we're able to move

05:45.226 --> 05:48.500
that and be responsive to the citizens of Houston.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.070
Next slide, please.

05:53.460 --> 05:57.404
Here we have our agenda office, the Economic Development

05:57.452 --> 06:01.024
office and the Special Events office. And all of

06:01.062 --> 06:04.000
these are statutorily mandated.

06:05.060 --> 06:08.324
I wanted to highlight a couple of things, and that is through our

06:08.362 --> 06:12.084
Economic Development Office. This is our office that administers the

06:12.122 --> 06:15.424
tours, the management districts, the tax abatements,

06:15.552 --> 06:19.240
and is responsible for over $25 million

06:19.310 --> 06:23.320
in billings through the Industrial Assessments

06:24.540 --> 06:28.024
each year. And then I wanted to also make note of

06:28.062 --> 06:31.564
our Special Events Office. Now that we are past COVID or

06:31.682 --> 06:35.448
post COVID and beginning to return to our mini events,

06:35.544 --> 06:39.004
this particular office produces about 2000

06:39.122 --> 06:42.780
special events per year for the City of Houston.

06:44.420 --> 06:45.650
Next slide, please.

06:49.860 --> 06:52.816
Here we have our Intergovernmental Relations Office,

06:52.918 --> 06:56.864
our Cultural Affairs, as well as our Veteran Affairs.

06:56.912 --> 07:00.470
And I wanted to highlight that our Gr team

07:01.240 --> 07:06.612
was mainly responsible for helping to bring $630,000,000

07:06.666 --> 07:10.472
of ARPA funds, which is really being

07:10.606 --> 07:13.832
relied upon to help us get through not only this year,

07:13.886 --> 07:17.544
but the next two years of deficits that

07:17.582 --> 07:20.970
we were experiencing due to COVID. So very important,

07:21.340 --> 07:24.824
their work that they're doing. And then our Veteran Affairs.

07:24.872 --> 07:28.984
I wanted to point out that Houston hosts the second largest veteran

07:29.032 --> 07:33.528
population in the country, over 300,000

07:33.634 --> 07:37.744
veterans, and this office basically provides services, referral services

07:37.862 --> 07:39.280
to that population.

07:41.220 --> 07:42.450
Next slide, please.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.324
Lastly, we have our communications office and our

07:56.362 --> 08:00.848
trade and international affairs and also Houston Television.

08:01.024 --> 08:04.068
And I wanted to point out that, of course,

08:04.234 --> 08:07.752
communications statutorily required by the Texas Public

08:07.806 --> 08:12.190
Information Act. But I wanted to point out that we receive about 170

08:12.960 --> 08:16.892
TPS per year and over 270 requests for

08:16.946 --> 08:20.908
proclamations or letters from the Mayor's office.

08:20.994 --> 08:24.816
And so that is a very busy office

08:24.918 --> 08:29.036
with a staff of two in trade and international affairs.

08:29.068 --> 08:33.120
This office is critical in coordinating the Mayor's

08:33.700 --> 08:37.376
abroad trade missions and also in marketing

08:37.408 --> 08:41.044
the City of Houston as an international city which

08:41.082 --> 08:43.888
we're very proud of. And then, lastly,

08:44.064 --> 08:47.604
Houston television. And that is

08:47.642 --> 08:50.936
mandated by Chapter 37 of the City of Houston Code of

08:50.958 --> 08:54.200
Ordinances. And of course the impact is

08:54.350 --> 08:57.896
better transparency of government and making sure that

08:57.918 --> 08:59.690
we have an informed public.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.590
Next slide please.

09:06.620 --> 09:09.880
This slide summarizes our revenues for the three

09:10.030 --> 09:13.560
funds that are managed in the Mayor's office. We have our general

09:13.630 --> 09:17.784
fund and we also have Houston television special revenue

09:17.832 --> 09:21.736
fund and the tourism and promotion special revenue

09:21.768 --> 09:24.872
fund. From our FY 22 estimate,

09:24.936 --> 09:28.840
the General Fund has increased in revenues of approximately

09:28.920 --> 09:32.252
$887,000 for FY

09:32.316 --> 09:36.256
23 and this is primarily due to the projected revenue from

09:36.278 --> 09:39.852
the new Digital Kiosk, which will begin generating

09:39.916 --> 09:42.870
revenue in the fourth quarter of 22.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.012
The revenue projected for FY 23 is for

09:47.066 --> 09:50.656
a full year of those revenues and the revenue

09:50.688 --> 09:54.616
projection for FY 22 was only prorated for a

09:54.638 --> 09:58.728
May start date. So there's also a $33,000

09:58.814 --> 10:02.484
increase in the Industrial District assessment

10:02.532 --> 10:06.076
revenue due to the expected increase in

10:06.098 --> 10:08.910
taxable values by 6.3 million.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.976
For our Houston Television Fund, we are projecting

10:14.008 --> 10:18.732
an overall revenue decrease of 69,000

10:18.866 --> 10:22.704
over the FY 22 estimate and this is

10:22.742 --> 10:26.560
primarily due to the projected decrease of the Peg fees, the public

10:26.630 --> 10:30.124
education and governmental revenues. And this is something that I've been sharing

10:30.172 --> 10:33.744
with Council for the last few years. That trend

10:33.792 --> 10:37.024
is continuing. Finally, for our Tourism

10:37.072 --> 10:41.220
and Promotion Fund, we are estimating an approximate $2.95

10:41.290 --> 10:45.092
million increase in revenue from our FY

10:45.156 --> 10:49.240
22 estimates and the increase is primarily due

10:49.580 --> 10:52.692
to the projected post pandemic increase

10:52.756 --> 10:56.084
in hotel Occupancy tax revenues,

10:56.212 --> 10:59.356
which we're very excited about based on information that

10:59.378 --> 11:03.304
has been provided by Houston. First, as you will recall, the FY

11:03.352 --> 11:07.116
21 revenues took a substantial hit as

11:07.138 --> 11:11.104
a result of COVID nineteen's impact and

11:11.142 --> 11:14.300
so we are now projecting for FY

11:14.380 --> 11:18.124
22 having a gradual comeback and for FY

11:18.172 --> 11:21.972
23 revenue budget reflects a very

11:22.026 --> 11:25.568
strong return to pre COVID activity.

11:25.744 --> 11:27.110
Next slide please.

11:39.340 --> 11:42.884
This slide reiterates the largest drivers of the revenue

11:42.932 --> 11:46.268
increases and decreases for FY 23 and most of

11:46.274 --> 11:48.936
which I discussed on the previous slide.

11:49.048 --> 11:53.128
General Fund revenue from the Digital Kiosk contract,

11:53.224 --> 11:56.808
HTV, the Peg, contributions from state franchise fees

11:56.904 --> 12:00.556
and a chargeback to funds for HTV.

12:00.668 --> 12:04.464
And lastly, tourism promotion. The hot receipts come

12:04.502 --> 12:07.440
back to pre COVID levels.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.490
Next slide please.

12:12.840 --> 12:16.164
This slide captures the expenditure comparison for all

12:16.202 --> 12:20.740
of our funds between the year in FY 22 estimate

12:21.560 --> 12:24.936
and the FY 23 proposed budget. So the

12:24.958 --> 12:28.456
General Fund shows an expenditure increase of

12:28.478 --> 12:32.424
$230,000 or 2.9%.

12:32.622 --> 12:35.904
However, this percentage includes the net adjustments

12:35.972 --> 12:39.804
which I'll talk about a little bit later for contractual municipal hope,

12:39.842 --> 12:43.688
pay increases, health insurance and restricted

12:43.864 --> 12:47.860
accounts. The almost $2.1 million

12:47.960 --> 12:51.868
increase in Houston Television Special Revenue Fund is primarily due

12:51.884 --> 12:56.592
to the projection in capital projects from

12:56.646 --> 12:59.916
year to year. So the FY 23 planned

12:59.948 --> 13:03.892
capital project improvements include the upgrade for

13:03.946 --> 13:06.980
the City Hall chambers, video control room,

13:07.130 --> 13:10.544
which was much needed, the new build of the City Council

13:10.592 --> 13:14.136
chambers and the terminal room along with the

13:14.158 --> 13:17.796
few much smaller projects. So these funds

13:17.828 --> 13:21.224
are capital dollars that are restricted for

13:21.262 --> 13:25.320
capital use only, so they cannot be used for administrative purposes.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.812
In the Tourism Special Revenue Fund, we project an increase of

13:30.866 --> 13:34.780
$3.1 million in expenditures or

13:34.850 --> 13:38.784
17.47% from the FY 22

13:38.822 --> 13:42.176
budget. And this is primarily due to the increase in the

13:42.198 --> 13:45.756
city's net receipts of the hot taxes and thus

13:45.788 --> 13:49.216
the city's payment going out to the

13:49.238 --> 13:52.784
arts partner houston Arts Alliance

13:52.912 --> 13:56.144
is projected to increase. As noted

13:56.192 --> 13:59.620
earlier, our FY 23 budget reflects a strong return

13:59.690 --> 14:03.464
to precovid activity and therefore, again an

14:03.502 --> 14:07.620
increase in the payment to the arts partner is anticipated.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.130
Next slide please.

14:16.110 --> 14:20.174
The next three slides provides a graphic representation of our

14:20.212 --> 14:24.202
personnel versus non personnel budgeted expenses

14:24.266 --> 14:26.938
for the Mayor's office's three funds.

14:27.114 --> 14:31.122
So to elaborate on that, the Mayor's Office General fund is

14:31.176 --> 14:34.206
65% personnel expenditures.

14:34.398 --> 14:37.538
Of the remaining 35%,

14:37.704 --> 14:42.180
68% of that is for the general fund transfer

14:42.970 --> 14:45.510
to subsidize special events.

14:46.330 --> 14:49.814
So the restricted accounts comprise 22% of this

14:49.852 --> 14:53.382
portion, leaving only 10%

14:53.516 --> 14:56.998
of the non personnel budget for services

14:57.084 --> 15:01.066
and supplies and those things like the novice account,

15:01.168 --> 15:05.100
office expenses, travel, parking and the like.

15:06.590 --> 15:07.900
Next slide, please.

15:14.190 --> 15:18.218
The Houston Television Special Revenue Fund is 26%

15:18.304 --> 15:22.270
personnel expenditures. Of the remaining 74%,

15:22.420 --> 15:25.870
more than half is for the planned capital improvement

15:26.530 --> 15:30.222
and more than a third is for the contractual payment to

15:30.276 --> 15:33.594
Houston Media Source. And this is the

15:33.652 --> 15:37.490
city's public access channel partner. The services and

15:37.560 --> 15:40.882
supplies account for only 6% and the

15:40.936 --> 15:44.514
restricted accounts also take another 6% of

15:44.552 --> 15:45.570
this portion.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.110
Next slide, please.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.460
Lastly, the tourism promotion special revenue fund

15:56.530 --> 15:59.912
is 15% personnel expenditures and

15:59.986 --> 16:03.168
85% other. And please keep in

16:03.174 --> 16:07.132
mind that this is the fund where we receive our hot taxes. So therefore

16:07.196 --> 16:11.170
the personnel budget is relatively very small.

16:14.020 --> 16:17.396
92% of the other charges are to pay the

16:17.418 --> 16:20.864
arts partner for the hot agreement and then supplies

16:20.912 --> 16:24.816
and services are there for only about 7% of the

16:24.858 --> 16:27.530
other for the entire fund.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.090
Next slide please.

16:33.460 --> 16:37.104
This slide gives a great summary of the

16:37.142 --> 16:41.348
net change in expenditure budget from FY 22

16:41.514 --> 16:44.944
to FY 23. The slide illustrates

16:44.992 --> 16:48.916
the net increase of $230,000

16:49.098 --> 16:53.192
from the FY 22 budget to FY 23

16:53.246 --> 16:57.172
proposed budget. And this represents

16:57.236 --> 17:00.872
a 2.9% change as

17:00.926 --> 17:04.504
discussed on slide number eleven. So beginning

17:04.552 --> 17:08.092
at the very top of this

17:08.146 --> 17:12.140
chart, you'll see that the Mayor's office FY 22

17:12.290 --> 17:15.804
operating budget is $6.95 million.

17:16.002 --> 17:21.010
So once we add to that our restricted account budget of 621,000

17:21.780 --> 17:25.100
FY 22 contractual municipal hope increases

17:25.180 --> 17:29.110
of 3% of 140,000

17:29.880 --> 17:34.230
revised projection of restricted accounts of 76,000

17:34.920 --> 17:38.980
the FY 22 council surplus of

17:39.050 --> 17:42.576
10,000, which was granted to us from council member

17:42.608 --> 17:46.072
Cisanero's Office for an Intern, and the Mayor's Office

17:46.126 --> 17:49.976
of Education and Funding for marketing specialists and

17:49.998 --> 17:53.412
special events and program adjustments that we took

17:53.486 --> 17:56.764
in the Economic Development Office for a

17:56.802 --> 18:01.644
total FY 22 budget of $7.9 million.

18:01.842 --> 18:05.464
Now, the next two areas, shaded areas on the chart,

18:05.512 --> 18:09.580
the blocks include our proposed operating budget adjustments

18:09.740 --> 18:13.004
for FY 23, and the first item

18:13.052 --> 18:16.316
is the reverse of the one time funding from Council Member

18:16.348 --> 18:20.096
Cisnero's office, the FY 22 surplus,

18:20.208 --> 18:23.316
FY 21 surplus, and the balance of the

18:23.338 --> 18:26.704
annualized funding amount for the economic development

18:26.752 --> 18:30.860
programming. So, added to this are the contractual

18:30.960 --> 18:34.970
adjustments for hope increases, health and benefits

18:35.660 --> 18:38.852
offset by a reduction in the restricted

18:38.916 --> 18:42.788
accounts taking. All of the increases

18:42.884 --> 18:46.776
and the decreases from the FY 22 operating budget

18:46.888 --> 18:50.412
yields the proposed FY 23 budget of

18:50.466 --> 18:53.848
$8.16 million for the Mayor's

18:53.864 --> 18:57.170
office. Next slide, please.

19:01.140 --> 19:05.436
This slide provides a brief narrative of each fund's expenditure highlights

19:05.468 --> 19:09.024
for your reference, and we discuss the expenditure highlights

19:09.072 --> 19:12.868
that are listed on slide number eleven. The general

19:12.954 --> 19:16.532
fund expense budget includes funding for contractual municipal hope

19:16.586 --> 19:19.732
pay increases, health benefits and

19:19.786 --> 19:23.524
restricted accounts. And some of the highlights of the fund include

19:23.572 --> 19:27.252
funding for capital improvements through Houston Television

19:27.396 --> 19:31.444
and in the Tourism Promotion Special Revenue Fund, the increase

19:31.572 --> 19:34.808
being attributed to the increase in hotel

19:34.904 --> 19:36.510
occupancy tax.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.910
Next slide, please.

19:45.840 --> 19:49.744
This concludes the financial portion of the Mayor's Office FY 23

19:49.782 --> 19:53.504
budget presentation. For your reference, we have included our

19:53.542 --> 19:57.600
office demographics and some just some

19:57.750 --> 20:01.600
of our FY 22 accomplishments in the appendix section.

20:02.180 --> 20:05.844
Thank you, and I'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

20:06.042 --> 20:09.616
And we also have our executive staff here in chambers to assist

20:09.648 --> 20:13.416
with questions that you may have regarding their specific areas of

20:13.438 --> 20:17.880
focus. I know that we have Andy Icken here from economic development.

20:20.930 --> 20:28.018
Why don't you all stand up everybody.

20:28.184 --> 20:31.906
So thank you all so much again. So we do

20:31.928 --> 20:35.506
have Ted Irving who is here, we have representatives from

20:35.528 --> 20:39.486
Veteran Affairs and we have representatives from Special Events

20:39.518 --> 20:42.914
as well as our Executive Offices. So turn

20:42.952 --> 20:45.766
it over to you. Any questions that you may have, we're happy to answer.

20:45.868 --> 20:49.426
Thank you very much, Ms. Hunter. And your staff is well represented.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.960
Great to see everyone here in the chamber with you.

20:52.490 --> 20:56.330
We also have been joined by a few colleagues and

20:56.400 --> 20:59.994
staff members. Council member Sally Alcorn has joined us and has been

21:00.032 --> 21:03.526
here this morning along with staff from council member

21:03.558 --> 21:07.146
Tasha Jackson as well as council member Michael Kubosh's

21:07.178 --> 21:10.958
office. So I wanted to acknowledge everyone here, we do have a couple of

21:11.044 --> 21:15.002
our council members in the queue before we get to our public speakers,

21:15.146 --> 21:18.770
but first, let's hear from Council Member Alcorn.

21:19.110 --> 21:22.210
Thank you, Chair, and thank you ms. Hunter,

21:22.790 --> 21:26.546
the big increases were in the HTV and then to

21:26.568 --> 21:29.394
the arts. I think I submitted those in writing, but you've covered them here.

21:29.432 --> 21:32.342
So I appreciate that. If we could have you or Mr.

21:32.396 --> 21:35.606
Irving elaborate a little bit more on the capital improvements that

21:35.628 --> 21:39.426
are being made. This include what's already been done in the chamber?

21:39.458 --> 21:42.860
Is more stuff coming? What's going on in the control room?

21:43.310 --> 21:46.586
A little bit more color around what I will allow

21:46.768 --> 21:50.998
serving to provide a little bit more detail regarding

21:51.014 --> 21:54.586
some of the improvements. But as you recall, we did a

21:54.608 --> 21:57.760
lot of improvements here. The lighting, of course, the sound.

21:58.290 --> 22:02.058
We still have some additional work to do. And those funds

22:02.074 --> 22:06.218
that we have that are part of the budget are specifically for capital improvements only.

22:06.324 --> 22:10.210
So you will see some additional work, but I'll allow him to elaborate further.

22:11.910 --> 22:14.514
Good morning. Good morning.

22:14.712 --> 22:18.934
To answer your question on the capital improvements, the city

22:18.972 --> 22:23.206
council horseshoe area was a phase one.

22:23.388 --> 22:27.606
And so the phase two is the control room that is behind

22:27.708 --> 22:31.302
this space. And at one point in time,

22:31.356 --> 22:35.306
that control room as well as the annex chambers control room had not

22:35.328 --> 22:39.738
been updated. There have been no updates excuse me, since 1997.

22:39.904 --> 22:43.766
They are extremely outdated. But due to the Cares

22:43.798 --> 22:47.594
Act, the annex control room has been modernized

22:47.642 --> 22:51.054
with virtual technology. In the next phase, the new build that

22:51.092 --> 22:55.598
Chief Hunter is discussing that we are working to have started

22:55.684 --> 22:58.642
here, hopefully in July, FY 23,

22:58.776 --> 23:01.730
will be this control room to have it modernized.

23:02.950 --> 23:06.942
Thank you, Council Member and Mr. Irving, I know having worked with you recently

23:07.006 --> 23:10.834
on the technology, the TTI committee, we are still tweaking

23:10.882 --> 23:14.386
some things. So, council Member, it is very much an ongoing

23:14.498 --> 23:18.326
program with coordination with the speakers and the It

23:18.428 --> 23:22.086
platforms and HTV, of course, trying to coordinate

23:22.118 --> 23:25.994
it all. So we thank you for that ongoing effort. Next we'll hear

23:26.032 --> 23:30.090
from Council member Cayman staff.

23:31.550 --> 23:35.406
Thank you, chair. Thank you, Ms. Hunter. Ms. Hunter, I was curious if

23:35.428 --> 23:38.794
you could speak to, given the city's budgetary constraints,

23:38.842 --> 23:42.426
any unmet needs or really particularly

23:42.458 --> 23:45.390
critical unmet needs that you all have identified.

23:46.530 --> 23:50.402
Well, I don't think we have any critical unmet needs

23:50.456 --> 23:53.634
at current. I think the biggest challenge that we face is

23:53.672 --> 23:57.438
that over the last several years, we have trimmed our budgets

23:57.454 --> 24:01.474
and kept everything very, very tight. And so in some instances,

24:01.522 --> 24:04.754
we've actually had to eliminate vacancies.

24:04.882 --> 24:08.162
And therefore our staffing is at a minimal

24:08.226 --> 24:11.718
right now. So as we continue to respond to

24:11.804 --> 24:15.786
citizens calls and all of the other things that we have to

24:15.808 --> 24:19.274
do within the office, it does present a challenge. But as far

24:19.312 --> 24:23.242
as unmet met needs, I don't think that we have any major ones

24:23.296 --> 24:26.374
at this point. Thank you for that question.

24:26.432 --> 24:30.362
We have a follow up question now in the queue from Council Member Alcorn.

24:30.506 --> 24:33.934
Thank you, Chair. On the Kiosk revenue, how many kiosks does

24:33.972 --> 24:37.742
that represent? Trying to remember. I think we have a contract

24:37.806 --> 24:41.234
for 25, but I'm going to have Andy Icken to come forward and answer those

24:41.272 --> 24:43.220
specific questions. Thank you.

24:45.890 --> 24:48.510
Good morning, Mr. Ickin. Welcome to the chamber.

24:49.650 --> 24:53.182
Good morning. Chief of staff is correct. The first

24:53.236 --> 24:55.922
segment, if you remember, council passed the first 25.

24:55.976 --> 24:59.954
We're well on the way to do that right now. They have been very well

24:59.992 --> 25:03.926
received and the advertising revenue was exceeding the expectations that we had at

25:03.948 --> 25:07.254
that time. I just saw one going in this morning as I was

25:07.292 --> 25:11.078
coming in on Prairie and Fanon. So that'll be 25

25:11.164 --> 25:14.760
within 75. 75 within

25:15.530 --> 25:19.290
fiscal year 23. Yeah, we're doing about five a month right now.

25:19.440 --> 25:23.226
That's the pace at which they are letting contracts and doing everything right

25:23.248 --> 25:26.906
now. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't come back to us very

25:26.928 --> 25:29.854
soon. If remember, we put a pause at 25.

25:30.052 --> 25:33.850
All the feedback we're getting, I'm not sure if council has any direct feedback

25:33.930 --> 25:37.038
has been very positive. Thank you.

25:37.204 --> 25:40.878
It might be helpful, director and

25:41.044 --> 25:44.126
chief, to see a map of all of that. I know

25:44.228 --> 25:47.166
at some point to get that update would be very we have such a map

25:47.198 --> 25:50.034
and we'll get that for you. Excellent. Very good. Well, I believe that is it

25:50.072 --> 25:52.814
for comments from the Horseshoe.

25:52.942 --> 25:56.226
Both council and staff have had their opportunity to speak. So we'll

25:56.258 --> 26:00.534
turn to those in public comment with the

26:00.572 --> 26:04.374
five virtual speakers that have signed up. We're seeing two

26:04.412 --> 26:07.898
of whom are here online or perhaps three. And we're going

26:07.904 --> 26:11.366
to start with Ms. Saba Blanding. Ms.

26:11.398 --> 26:14.940
Blanding, we may 1 hear from you.

26:16.350 --> 26:19.534
Good morning. Thank you for your time.

26:19.732 --> 26:23.134
I had a couple of questions. The first was that on

26:23.172 --> 26:27.194
slide two it says the executive office develops and coordinates

26:27.242 --> 26:30.970
all city policies. Can we return to a budget hearings where

26:30.980 --> 26:34.514
the public can ask department directors their questions directly? If not,

26:34.552 --> 26:38.574
why not? And then my second question is on slide

26:38.702 --> 26:42.178
28. You mentioned initiatives with Houston's unhoused community.

26:42.344 --> 26:46.258
What efforts are being made to be proactive and mitigate evictions?

26:46.354 --> 26:50.758
Our housing department is grossly underfunded with a budget of only $400,000.

26:50.924 --> 26:53.570
Houston renters, I mean, to quote the Houston Chronicle,

26:53.650 --> 26:57.538
houston renters are now more cost burdened and evicted at a higher rate than

26:57.564 --> 27:01.050
renters in Dallas, Chicago or Atlanta.

27:01.470 --> 27:04.938
In 2019, one in eleven renter households in Harris County had

27:04.944 --> 27:08.138
an eviction notice posted on their door. I know Harris and Houston are

27:08.144 --> 27:11.274
different, but we have a lot of overlap. And an analysis

27:11.322 --> 27:14.634
by the eviction lab at Princeton University found 16 Houston apartment

27:14.682 --> 27:18.046
complexes have filed for more than 100 evictions each and

27:18.068 --> 27:21.454
over the course of the pandemic. So the first question is about thank you,

27:21.492 --> 27:25.138
Ms. Landing, Ms. Blanding, thank you

27:25.224 --> 27:28.894
for your question. Your time has expired. Give the chief

27:28.942 --> 27:32.918
the option to respond. But I think we, as you understand, have been

27:33.004 --> 27:37.058
restricted by the instruction of the administration

27:37.154 --> 27:40.210
and seeing no council members in queue to respond,

27:40.370 --> 27:43.714
we will move on to our next speaker, who is Ms.

27:43.762 --> 27:47.082
Lien Chong. Ms. Chong, if you're with us,

27:47.136 --> 27:51.354
we'll give you a moment to hit star six to unmute or

27:51.392 --> 27:53.660
otherwise speak up and we'll hear you.

27:56.190 --> 28:00.094
Hello, can you hear me? Yes, Ms. Chong. Go ahead.

28:00.292 --> 28:04.320
We hear you and see you online. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

28:05.730 --> 28:09.914
Awesome. So I am an artist and

28:10.052 --> 28:13.534
I'm an organizer for Arts Accountability Houston.

28:13.662 --> 28:17.620
And we have many engaged artists who are

28:19.270 --> 28:23.094
advocating for public funding for the arts here in

28:23.132 --> 28:26.786
Houston. Now, we are aware of a proposal that's

28:26.818 --> 28:30.502
been sent to the mayor by the Cultural District for

28:30.556 --> 28:34.002
Arca funding to be allocated to the arts

28:34.066 --> 28:37.786
in Houston. I'd like to sort of as a member of

28:37.808 --> 28:41.210
the public Advocate for these fundings to

28:41.280 --> 28:44.874
go to fund the arts here in

28:44.912 --> 28:48.880
Houston. I know it's not on the budget, but we are

28:49.410 --> 28:52.826
curious to know when these funds

28:52.858 --> 28:56.366
will be confirmed from the city to support

28:56.468 --> 29:00.646
the arts here in Houston. Any organizations

29:00.698 --> 29:04.414
are still suffering as a result of the pandemic

29:04.462 --> 29:08.580
and we would really like for the city to

29:09.350 --> 29:12.594
allocate ARPA funding towards the arts here in

29:12.632 --> 29:16.374
Houston. Thank you very much, Mrs. Chong. We're well

29:16.412 --> 29:20.246
aware of the ongoing challenges for our arts community

29:20.348 --> 29:24.294
and thank you very much for bringing this question to council. It is something

29:24.492 --> 29:28.266
that we are working on with local organizations and

29:28.368 --> 29:32.106
appreciate you calling our attention to it and

29:32.128 --> 29:35.674
we will stay vigilant with that item. Next, we'll hear from

29:35.712 --> 29:40.190
Mr. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. We will respond accordingly.

29:41.090 --> 29:44.574
Our next speaker is Mr. Jason Oliver. Mr.

29:44.612 --> 29:47.934
Oliver, if you're with us or hit

29:47.972 --> 29:52.034
star six to unmute, I'm here. Good morning.

29:52.232 --> 29:56.222
First, I want to speak up in support of Leanne

29:56.286 --> 30:00.002
and the arts proposal. Like, there was

30:00.056 --> 30:04.042
significant losses and hot taxes and using ARPA

30:04.046 --> 30:08.294
funds for revenue replacement would be a great idea to kind of stimulate the

30:08.332 --> 30:11.058
economy and economic activity in Houston.

30:11.234 --> 30:15.126
First, and so along those lines, it's come up before, but I'm interested in

30:15.148 --> 30:18.502
the process for approving ARPA fund suggestions. Can you share

30:18.556 --> 30:22.106
that process and any rubric that exists? Also, I would like

30:22.128 --> 30:25.354
to see the proposals that have been received by the mayor's office

30:25.392 --> 30:28.758
thus far. And then second, HTV feels

30:28.774 --> 30:32.174
like an under celebrated entity within the city, but it's vital for

30:32.212 --> 30:36.154
transparency. As Ms. Hunter mentioned, the expenditures accepting

30:36.202 --> 30:40.042
a two and a half million furniture and equipment line item seemed flat

30:40.106 --> 30:43.966
decreasing over the past six years, even with the pandemic

30:43.998 --> 30:47.794
going on. I'm wondering if HTV saw an increased workload during

30:47.832 --> 30:51.506
the pandemic and if there was an increase in overtime or other pay, because I'm

30:51.528 --> 30:55.038
not seeing it in the line items. Thank you. Thank you,

30:55.064 --> 30:58.646
Mr. Oliver. I'm going to pick up on your final point there about the good

30:58.668 --> 31:02.358
work of HTV. And I know council members have

31:02.364 --> 31:06.294
been encouraged to utilize that facility and

31:06.492 --> 31:10.006
that ability for us to really program according

31:10.038 --> 31:13.686
to some of the highlights of what we're doing around City Hall.

31:13.718 --> 31:17.574
So, again, thank you for your question, for being here with us virtually.

31:17.702 --> 31:21.118
And Ms. Hunter, again, I want to thank you for your presentation today,

31:21.204 --> 31:24.042
for your team being here with us in chambers.

31:24.186 --> 31:27.950
And with that, we will take a break and

31:28.020 --> 31:31.502
resume after lunch this afternoon at 01:00

31:31.566 --> 31:35.154
with presentation of the budget workshop. Our next group to hear

31:35.192 --> 31:39.838
from will be our legal department. And with that, our break commences.

31:40.014 --> 31:42.210
Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Council.

32:00.910 --> 32:04.970
Share the investment priorities identified by the Eastwood Civic Association.

32:05.130 --> 32:08.830
We need relief on three lines to improve mobility in our community.

32:08.980 --> 32:12.382
I will speak to the Galveston sub and my neighbor Lindsay, who's up next,

32:12.436 --> 32:16.082
will speak about east and west belts later on the Galveston sub.

32:16.136 --> 32:19.378
Our top priority is an underpass on lockwood, which was in the

32:19.384 --> 32:23.054
presentation. This is the expected route of Metro BRT's

32:23.102 --> 32:26.766
University corridor line. But let me be clear. Our neighborhood believes

32:26.798 --> 32:30.178
an overpass in this area wouldn't be the right solution.

32:30.274 --> 32:33.686
We are instead in favor of a small underpass that would provide the

32:33.708 --> 32:37.190
community with one additional north south crossing, but still leave

32:37.260 --> 32:40.922
seven crossings aggregate that are blocked daily. As such,

32:40.976 --> 32:44.726
I urge the city of Houston to also seek funding for a rail improvement

32:44.758 --> 32:47.882
study on this line to explore alternative solutions that address

32:47.936 --> 32:50.726
the entirety of the sub, not just one crossing.

32:50.838 --> 32:54.346
And this needs to be done in conjunction with Metro to ensure solutions

32:54.378 --> 32:58.154
can be expedited to align with the timelines for BRT construction.

32:58.282 --> 33:01.774
Thank you, Chair. My colleague Glimpsey will share priorities for East End,

33:01.812 --> 33:05.026
West Belt or east and west belts in her remarks. Thank you.

33:05.128 --> 33:07.598
Thank you very much, Ms. La Perrier,

33:07.694 --> 33:10.866
and we'll proceed with the I believe hold on.

33:10.888 --> 33:14.290
Before you leave the podium, we have a question from Chair Gallegos.

33:15.110 --> 33:18.626
Thank you, Daniel, for being here today and representing Eastwood.

33:18.818 --> 33:22.118
Just for your information, a couple of weeks ago, I did meet with

33:22.204 --> 33:25.734
the new board chair, Sanjay, and did

33:25.772 --> 33:29.526
bring that to his attention. He came into my office that there are concerns

33:29.558 --> 33:33.306
in regards to the BRT going down lockwood, in regards to

33:33.328 --> 33:36.730
an overpass that may be constructed or an underpass.

33:37.150 --> 33:40.366
So they are aware of it and we are going

33:40.388 --> 33:43.898
to be monitoring it. Thank you. Thank you, council member.

33:44.074 --> 33:47.706
Proceed to our next speaker. Thanks again. Ms. Lindsay Williams

33:47.898 --> 33:51.354
with us virtually and online. Proceed,

33:51.402 --> 33:52.450
ms Williams.

33:54.870 --> 33:57.570
If you'd hit star six to unmute,

33:58.790 --> 34:00.530
we'll await your comment.

34:03.030 --> 34:04.790
Ms. Lindsay Williams,

34:05.450 --> 34:06.200
online.

34:09.130 --> 34:12.706
We see you online. If you can unmute

34:12.818 --> 34:13.880
star six,

34:16.250 --> 34:19.290
we can come back to you if there are technical challenges.

34:21.070 --> 34:24.266
With that nice intro from Danielle, I'm sorry we can't take

34:24.288 --> 34:27.180
it right to Ms. Williams, but we'll come back to you if we can.

34:27.710 --> 34:31.418
Mr. Tom Thompson, also online, virtually testing

34:31.434 --> 34:37.710
our system here. Mr. Thompson, are you there? Are you able to mute unmute,

34:38.530 --> 34:39.870
please. Unmute.

34:42.980 --> 34:46.724
We see you, Mr. Thompson, and we know

34:46.762 --> 34:50.260
we heard you at the public session this week at council.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.400
We're checking our system to see if there's any technical challenges

34:54.480 --> 34:57.592
right now, but proceeding with our list, a call

34:57.646 --> 35:00.890
for either Ms. Williams or Mr. Thompson online.

35:02.060 --> 35:05.384
And while we're addressing the challenges there, we will

35:05.502 --> 35:08.900
proceed. Present here in chambers

35:08.980 --> 35:11.560
is Punkaj Wadha.

35:12.380 --> 35:15.800
Punkage is here with us. Let's hear from you at the podium,

35:15.960 --> 35:18.892
sir. Thank you for being here. If you could state your name for the record

35:18.946 --> 35:21.260
and proceed with your question or comment.

35:22.740 --> 35:24.370
Yes, sir. Thank you.

35:26.580 --> 35:30.400
Good morning. Good morning, Council. Good morning.

35:30.470 --> 35:33.308
Thank you for holding this meeting. Thank you, BNSF,

35:33.404 --> 35:37.096
for being present, providing vital

35:37.148 --> 35:40.932
rail services to our city and the country. I just want to say I love

35:40.986 --> 35:44.532
trains. I enjoy counting train cars with my kids

35:44.586 --> 35:47.472
as they roll by when I'm stuck at one of the block crossings,

35:47.616 --> 35:50.588
unfortunately. My name is Punkage Wadhwa.

35:50.624 --> 35:53.816
I'm part of the Houston Quiet Zones Committee, and I'm one of the

35:53.838 --> 35:57.156
residents in the neighborhoods that are near the BNSF

35:57.188 --> 36:01.044
rail line that runs parallel to the 34th street tracks

36:01.172 --> 36:04.696
just north outside of 610 Loop on the northwest

36:04.728 --> 36:08.584
side from the neighborhoods from Oak Forest all the way to Independence

36:08.632 --> 36:12.396
Heights. As you can see on the map I provided you guys,

36:12.578 --> 36:16.160
there are over 500 households that have voiced their support

36:16.230 --> 36:19.532
for the 34th Street Street quadzone corridor.

36:19.596 --> 36:23.436
Considering each household typically has two to four residents,

36:23.468 --> 36:26.976
there are at least several thousand Houstonians impacted

36:27.008 --> 36:29.940
by the train horns on this stretch of tracks.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.516
It's time to silence the train horns in Houston's. People in

36:34.538 --> 36:38.036
countries around the world live in communities

36:38.228 --> 36:41.764
that are much more dense without the obnoxiously loud

36:41.812 --> 36:44.868
train horns. Houston can do the same. We don't

36:44.884 --> 36:49.076
live in the 18 hundreds with coal fired trains belching

36:49.108 --> 36:52.364
out black soot black soot and polluting the environment, do we?

36:52.482 --> 36:56.248
Then why should we live with an outdated safety measure as a train horn?

36:56.424 --> 36:59.624
The train horn is the last resort for emergency situations,

36:59.672 --> 37:02.460
notifying anyone to get off the tracks,

37:03.040 --> 37:06.956
same as it is for when we drive our vehicles. We don't honk our horn

37:07.068 --> 37:09.200
every time we drive through an intersection.

37:10.980 --> 37:14.976
We don't honk our horn when we change lanes. So we

37:14.998 --> 37:19.216
have safety measures in place. And we have the technology to mandate,

37:19.328 --> 37:23.044
per the City of Houston infrastructure Design manual, to put these

37:23.082 --> 37:26.180
measures in place and have horns only as a last resort.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.916
Per the FRA. The City of Houston has the authority

37:30.948 --> 37:34.536
to mandate this, to put effective quiet zones in

37:34.558 --> 37:37.896
place, as you guys have discussed earlier today, and I know you guys

37:37.918 --> 37:41.044
are in process of doing that, but we need to do this now.

37:41.102 --> 37:44.316
It's long awaited. You guys are part of the quality of

37:44.338 --> 37:47.964
life committee. It's now time to make this better for all

37:48.002 --> 37:51.576
citizens. Quality of. Life, especially the thousands of Houstonians

37:51.608 --> 37:54.928
that have just advocated for this. If I

37:54.934 --> 37:58.284
may have one more minute. Well, you can conclude your remarks.

37:58.332 --> 38:01.404
Yeah, I have one more minute. I'll give you a few more seconds.

38:01.532 --> 38:04.816
I'm speaking on behalf of thousands of members of we have

38:04.838 --> 38:08.496
a long way to go today, Mr. Padwa. Thank you. Okay. Regarding funding and costs

38:08.528 --> 38:11.844
of the quiet zones, I don't think the city should be burdened with this,

38:11.882 --> 38:15.296
nor the taxpayers. Let's look at BNSF's

38:15.328 --> 38:19.112
financial statement. In 2021, they had 22 billions in

38:19.166 --> 38:22.648
revenue, 13 billions in expenses, with a net

38:22.814 --> 38:25.992
income of 7 billion. Now, if you look at the number,

38:26.126 --> 38:29.690
350,000 was mentioned earlier as a cost per.

38:30.860 --> 38:34.556
If you'd like to intersection, we can take your comment online and we'll be

38:34.578 --> 38:38.156
happy to post it and circulate it to the committees. But thank you

38:38.178 --> 38:41.916
again for being here. I appreciate asking your question. I appreciate you allowing me

38:41.938 --> 38:45.996
to speak. If you could wrap up, you're looking at 0.3% of BNF's

38:46.028 --> 38:50.032
profits to implement a $2 million quiet zone along

38:50.086 --> 38:53.160
the 34th street corridor.

38:53.340 --> 38:55.830
Thank you very much. Appreciate that.

38:58.200 --> 39:01.668
Proceeding now to our next speaker. We're going to try again for

39:01.754 --> 39:05.868
online. Our speaker is Ms. Orlando Pulito.

39:05.984 --> 39:07.930
Ms. Pulito, if you're here,

39:09.340 --> 39:12.616
please join. There you are. Okay, thank you.

39:12.638 --> 39:14.730
Ms. Pulito, we can hear you. Hello?

39:16.940 --> 39:20.636
Go ahead, ma'am. We can hear you. Okay,

39:20.738 --> 39:23.500
thank you for allowing me a few minutes to speak.

39:23.570 --> 39:27.000
So I submitted in writing

39:27.080 --> 39:30.316
my concerns to back up what I'm speaking of

39:30.338 --> 39:34.160
today. So with the railroad I've been in this community for a very long time,

39:34.310 --> 39:38.384
and I'm just very upset. The fact that

39:38.582 --> 39:43.240
the railroad is sitting there talking about they have daily conversations,

39:43.420 --> 39:46.864
monthly meetings, but yet there's no solution. In addition

39:46.912 --> 39:50.550
to this blocking of

39:51.480 --> 39:55.376
vehicles having to reroute include massive 18 wheelers

39:55.408 --> 39:59.556
trying to get to these back industries, these are neighborhoods.

39:59.588 --> 40:03.176
These are small streets. And these massive trucks navigating through the

40:03.198 --> 40:07.320
community are not only tearing up our streets, but more importantly,

40:07.980 --> 40:11.108
we have a trail, walking trail. We have a park,

40:11.204 --> 40:14.776
but our wires sit low when they come through here, and I've

40:14.808 --> 40:18.524
already reported this numerous times, they cause damage to my house in more ways

40:18.562 --> 40:21.884
than one. They have popped my Internet wires,

40:22.012 --> 40:25.040
causing my whole house to be damaged.

40:25.940 --> 40:29.184
They forced their way in anyhow possible any way

40:29.222 --> 40:33.264
possible. And I've submitted pictures of that. We have

40:33.302 --> 40:36.464
children riding their bikes. We have people. We have older seniors

40:36.512 --> 40:40.436
walking. These trucks are

40:40.458 --> 40:43.552
trying to get to this industry. They're trying to exit this industry.

40:43.696 --> 40:48.056
Our community streets are not for that. And the

40:48.078 --> 40:51.720
young man before me was talking about the revenue. Yeah,

40:51.790 --> 40:55.256
there has to be alternative ways in these meetings that they have to put this

40:55.278 --> 40:59.112
revenue in effect. But more importantly

40:59.176 --> 41:02.670
is, yeah, we need solutions and we need them quickly.

41:04.400 --> 41:08.124
Thank you very much, Ms. Pulito. We do have the handout that you

41:08.162 --> 41:11.788
brought or delivered to us with the photographs that you

41:11.794 --> 41:16.416
mentioned. So thank you for that, and we

41:16.438 --> 41:19.664
will post those and circulate. So thank you again for your

41:19.702 --> 41:22.540
comments and being here. Seeing no questions from the council,

41:22.620 --> 41:25.788
we're going to proceed to the next speaker, which is Ms.

41:25.884 --> 41:29.444
Mara Gomez. Ms. Gomez is here with us in City

41:29.482 --> 41:33.380
Hall chambers, so thank you for being here. If you join us at the podium,

41:33.720 --> 41:37.320
we'd love to hear your comment or question today for the council.

41:37.820 --> 41:41.530
If you could identify yourself. Yes, good morning.

41:41.980 --> 41:46.024
My name is Mana Gomez, and I am with Link Houston, a nonprofit that

41:46.062 --> 41:49.596
advocates for a robust and equitable transportation network so that all

41:49.618 --> 41:53.724
people can reach opportunity. Today, I am addressing this joint committee about

41:53.762 --> 41:57.656
the increasing burden train blockages continue to pose for transit

41:57.688 --> 42:01.196
riders, bicyclists, and pedestrians in the

42:01.218 --> 42:04.764
East End and Fifth Ward communities. Link Houston shares

42:04.812 --> 42:08.096
many of the concerns residents are sharing with you today.

42:08.278 --> 42:11.616
I live in the East End, so I experience firsthand the

42:11.638 --> 42:14.500
impact these train blockages have on our communities.

42:16.520 --> 42:19.312
We are forced to reroute to access jobs,

42:19.376 --> 42:22.064
education, health care and wellness,

42:22.192 --> 42:25.616
recreational opportunities, and other essential destinations.

42:25.728 --> 42:29.284
For example, while riding Metro's 40 local bus route,

42:29.332 --> 42:32.712
one day, the driver had to reroute along the I 45

42:32.766 --> 42:36.184
frontage road and missed ten stops on both

42:36.222 --> 42:39.400
sides of the train blockage. Several Metro bus routes

42:39.480 --> 42:42.984
are often forced to redirect when trains block

42:43.032 --> 42:46.616
a crossing, causing people to be late to their destinations.

42:46.808 --> 42:49.688
Some pedestrians, school age children included,

42:49.784 --> 42:53.120
go under or over in between the cars of trains

42:53.460 --> 42:57.024
of stopped trains blocking their route and risk their lives by doing

42:57.062 --> 43:01.212
so. Pedestrians will try to find the quickest way to their destination,

43:01.356 --> 43:04.724
especially if they're being late affects their quality of

43:04.762 --> 43:08.672
life. Additionally, they can force bicyclists

43:08.736 --> 43:11.956
to reroute onto busier streets, which may not have

43:11.978 --> 43:16.060
the built in infrastructure to afford sufficient safety.

43:16.240 --> 43:19.860
So today, we ask the Federal Railroad Administration,

43:20.020 --> 43:23.524
Up, BNSF and the KCS rail

43:23.572 --> 43:27.672
companies to work with our local elected officials and communities to find

43:27.726 --> 43:31.624
the best community driven solutions to these train blockages

43:31.752 --> 43:35.384
with our most vulnerable road users in mind, and without further

43:35.432 --> 43:38.940
dividing the communities the railway infrastructure goes through.

43:39.090 --> 43:42.736
And we ask our elected officials to help hold these companies

43:42.838 --> 43:46.444
accountable and do right by the communities they operate

43:46.492 --> 43:50.012
in. Your efforts to remedy these issues will remove

43:50.076 --> 43:54.144
adverse barriers and bring about equity in historically underserved

43:54.192 --> 43:56.736
areas. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ms.

43:56.768 --> 44:00.144
Gomez, for your comments. Seeing no questions in the queue,

44:00.192 --> 44:04.180
we'll proceed. I see that Ms. Williams has

44:04.250 --> 44:08.004
rejoined us or hopefully is able to unmute Ms.

44:08.052 --> 44:11.672
Williams. Can you do that? There you are. Yes.

44:11.726 --> 44:14.970
Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. Loud and clear. Perfect.

44:15.660 --> 44:19.064
My name is Lindsay Williams. I'm the Eastwood Civic Association train

44:19.102 --> 44:22.732
committee chair, continuing to share our investment priorities. Danielle started

44:22.786 --> 44:26.444
with on the west belt. We agreed with the prioritization of

44:26.482 --> 44:30.264
York Street, presented by staff and included in the ten year old rail district

44:30.312 --> 44:33.580
study. However, there is a critical missing piece in Phase one

44:33.650 --> 44:37.536
needed to address the Nhhips plan. In anticipation of

44:37.558 --> 44:40.716
the closure at Polk and St. Emmanuel, we would urge the inclusion

44:40.748 --> 44:44.524
of an underpass at Leland as an equal priority. To allow Eastern residents

44:44.572 --> 44:48.576
a straight access to downtown on the East Belt, the community desperately

44:48.608 --> 44:52.084
needs at least one east west crossing, either at Polk lawndale or

44:52.122 --> 44:55.648
telephone. Each crossing has its merits. Polk serves as a route

44:55.664 --> 44:59.576
for Metro buses, lawndale would provide better access to Kip School and

44:59.598 --> 45:03.176
post office, and the telephone may undergo a complete transformation if

45:03.198 --> 45:06.584
the raised grant and Terra's 23 partnerships come through. There are

45:06.622 --> 45:09.656
test choices, but we'd be happy to work with the city to engage with the

45:09.678 --> 45:12.840
community on which crossing they would like to see prioritize.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.368
Moving on from infrastructure to Quiet Zones since at least 2011,

45:17.464 --> 45:21.068
the neighborhood has been seeking quiet zones across the West Belt, East Belt and the

45:21.074 --> 45:25.088
Galveston Line. Each time, there's something preventing quiet zones from moving forward,

45:25.174 --> 45:28.268
funding other priorities, or waiting on no horn signs.

45:28.364 --> 45:32.080
Council, there are new Bil grants which could solve for funding.

45:33.460 --> 45:36.528
We could have had quiet zones implemented a long time ago with the use of

45:36.534 --> 45:40.336
grants to improve infrastructure, but it feels like our voices have gone unheard.

45:40.448 --> 45:43.796
Money is available now, and there seems to be no urgency at the city to

45:43.818 --> 45:47.524
apply for dollars to improve quality of life in the East End. Projects have

45:47.562 --> 45:51.156
historically been focused on the West Side, and it's time to see dollars helping

45:51.188 --> 45:54.984
those who live east of I 45 put the money where the problem is,

45:55.022 --> 45:58.644
and it's in the East End. Chicago is already celebrating Bil

45:58.692 --> 46:02.220
dollars that they expect to receive, and we are already behind.

46:02.370 --> 46:05.676
So, passing it back to council, how soon do you expect to have the

46:05.698 --> 46:09.036
first proposals ready for funding from the Bil? And I hope you

46:09.058 --> 46:12.528
have an answer. Well, Ms. Williams, I want

46:12.534 --> 46:15.996
to thank you for being here and asking your question. I don't see any council

46:16.028 --> 46:19.360
members jumping at the opportunity to respond,

46:21.540 --> 46:24.728
but at the same time, well, there we go. We've got Council

46:24.764 --> 46:28.032
Member Chair Alcorn here to address you. Ms. Williams.

46:28.096 --> 46:30.548
Thank you. Good question. And we'll find out.

46:30.634 --> 46:34.944
And I just want to say I'm so impressed with the Eastwood residents.

46:34.992 --> 46:39.764
I mean, you guys not only know your comments are with such specificity

46:39.892 --> 46:43.176
that is so helpful about what you exactly want. You have a lot

46:43.198 --> 46:46.664
of knowledge about the funding opportunities. You guys know

46:46.702 --> 46:50.410
your stuff. And I for 01:00 a.m. Impressed by that and will certainly

46:51.120 --> 46:54.828
do what I can to advocate for what you're talking about.

46:54.994 --> 46:58.424
We are working very hard here. Thank you, Ms. Williams.

46:58.472 --> 47:01.100
We have council member Gallegos also in the queue.

47:01.540 --> 47:05.008
Thank you, Ms. Williams, for taking time to be here.

47:05.174 --> 47:09.216
Just for your information, we have submitted a request to

47:09.318 --> 47:13.292
congresswoman Garcia and congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee

47:13.436 --> 47:16.896
for funding for community project for the east

47:16.928 --> 47:20.304
end quiet two zone. So we're hoping

47:20.352 --> 47:24.048
that that will be approved. Thank you. Thank you council

47:24.064 --> 47:28.224
member, and thank you Ms. Williams, for being here again for your leadership

47:28.272 --> 47:31.816
in the community and bringing your question today. So with that,

47:31.838 --> 47:34.472
we're moving on to the next speaker. We're going to try again for Mr.

47:34.526 --> 47:37.624
Tom Thompson if he's back online and

47:37.662 --> 47:41.576
able to join us, star six to unmute.

47:41.768 --> 47:45.356
Otherwise, we're going to proceed with the

47:45.378 --> 47:48.680
next speaker, which is Ms. Amy Din. Amy din

47:48.760 --> 47:52.044
virtually with us, I believe. Amy,

47:52.092 --> 47:53.250
are you there?

47:58.930 --> 48:02.586
We're seeing you online but hearing nothing. Can you join

48:02.618 --> 48:03.920
us with star six?

48:07.110 --> 48:10.818
If not, we will proceed and hopefully get back from you.

48:10.904 --> 48:14.530
The next speaker on the list is Mr. Clay Dippel.

48:15.830 --> 48:19.646
Clay, glad you're with us. If you could approach to the podium,

48:19.838 --> 48:23.286
happy to hear your question or comment today. If you could identify yourself for the

48:23.308 --> 48:27.302
record. Thank you very much. I'm Clay Dippel, I'm also

48:27.356 --> 48:30.150
a resident of Eastwood. I want to thank you committee members,

48:30.220 --> 48:34.086
elected officials, chief pena, thank you. And to the railroads.

48:34.118 --> 48:37.946
I also regret that the FRA could not make it. We have

48:37.968 --> 48:41.254
established in several public meetings that the train blockages

48:41.302 --> 48:44.570
in the east end have been increasing in frequency and in duration,

48:44.650 --> 48:47.360
all while the trains themselves get longer,

48:47.730 --> 48:51.726
while Houston's population grows. Union pacific tells us they

48:51.748 --> 48:56.274
expect train traffic through our neighborhood is only going to increase with

48:56.312 --> 49:00.206
just a $30 security camera at just one crossing

49:00.318 --> 49:04.226
in Eastwood, private citizens have unmassed an incredible amount of

49:04.248 --> 49:08.734
data to prove the scope of the blockage problem. It's measurable,

49:08.862 --> 49:12.098
it's persistent, and it's about public safety.

49:12.274 --> 49:15.666
The problem is only going to get worse. We come now to urge

49:15.698 --> 49:19.494
the council to work with city public works starting today to use this

49:19.532 --> 49:23.034
data and the data from these pilot surveillance programs to

49:23.072 --> 49:27.414
create a concrete action plan. We want to know how Houston

49:27.462 --> 49:31.110
can apply and allocate for infrastructure dollars for grade separated

49:31.190 --> 49:34.426
underpasses completion of long promised quiet

49:34.458 --> 49:37.982
zones and additional improvement studies so that a comprehensive plan

49:38.036 --> 49:41.162
can give your constituents a clear understanding

49:41.226 --> 49:44.622
of which projects you intend to apply for in each

49:44.676 --> 49:47.860
year of the BIL's five available years.

49:48.390 --> 49:51.470
Rail operators have long treated our neighborhood,

49:51.550 --> 49:55.646
Eastwood like a parking lot for trains that are too long by their own standards

49:55.678 --> 49:59.542
to fit in the switching yards built to accommodate them. They don't even know which

49:59.596 --> 50:03.110
intersections they're blocking. The people who live and work

50:03.180 --> 50:06.674
and shop and invest here want to see boots on the ground to secure

50:06.722 --> 50:10.166
funding for a fix. Please take ownership of

50:10.188 --> 50:13.706
this issue. Council members, you are our voice. We need you

50:13.728 --> 50:17.306
to speak up for us. And I end with a question for council. What are

50:17.328 --> 50:21.014
the city of Houston's funding request priorities for alleviating rail

50:21.062 --> 50:24.894
blockage issues? And how do you intend to involve the community in

50:24.932 --> 50:28.414
deciding which of these improvements come 1st? First of all, Mr.

50:28.452 --> 50:32.798
Dibble, thank you very much for being here today. And for your question for

50:32.964 --> 50:35.390
response is Chair Gallegos.

50:36.930 --> 50:40.706
Thank you, Chair. And thank you, Clay, for your continued advocacy. I know you

50:40.728 --> 50:44.366
and others were at the town hall held

50:44.398 --> 50:48.038
by the Easton Chamber as well as the Fifth Ward and

50:48.124 --> 50:51.922
there at Guadalupe Church with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.

50:52.066 --> 50:55.686
And thank you for the nice handwritten note. Appreciate that

50:55.708 --> 50:59.538
as well. Thank you. Also, I just want to say

50:59.644 --> 51:03.178
that's why it's so important that Union Pacific and

51:03.264 --> 51:07.322
Burlington Northern are aware of this

51:07.376 --> 51:11.014
triangle wish affects Eastwood Fire Station

51:11.062 --> 51:14.398
18. Again, it doesn't happen often, but it

51:14.404 --> 51:17.390
does happen where there's a train on all three tracks.

51:17.730 --> 51:21.470
So you're talking about residents, you're talking about emergency vehicles.

51:22.050 --> 51:25.146
Again, you're talking about parents that can't take their kids to

51:25.188 --> 51:28.914
school or pick them up after school. So it's just

51:28.952 --> 51:32.238
chaos. And that's why I'm asking Burnington Northern and Union

51:32.254 --> 51:36.638
Pacific to look at this triangle and ask your dispatchers

51:36.814 --> 51:40.786
to not stop trains within this triangle because it impacts

51:40.818 --> 51:44.198
quite a few residents. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you,

51:44.204 --> 51:48.626
Chair. Great question. Appreciate you being here. Our next speaker

51:48.738 --> 51:52.440
is Ms. Erica Miranda, who I believe is online.

51:52.970 --> 51:56.122
This is Amy Den. Okay. Can you hear me?

51:56.176 --> 52:00.026
Yeah. Let's hold off on the question for Ms. Miranda and go back on our

52:00.128 --> 52:02.800
list for Ms. Din. We can hear you, Amy. Go ahead.

52:03.490 --> 52:06.718
Thank you. Sorry, somehow we had a

52:06.724 --> 52:10.430
misconnection, so my name is Amy Denn. I'm the president

52:10.500 --> 52:14.382
of Super Neighborhood 64 and 88. We appreciate your having

52:14.436 --> 52:18.190
the second meeting on railroad operations after the January

52:18.270 --> 52:22.046
2022 meeting. Since your first joint Committee meeting

52:22.078 --> 52:25.822
in January, our Super Neighborhood conducted a community survey

52:25.886 --> 52:29.314
regarding railroad impacts. And Mr. Hannigritt presented at our

52:29.352 --> 52:32.726
February 9, 2022 Super Neighborhood meeting to

52:32.748 --> 52:36.514
share the information with our community members specific to our neighborhood.

52:36.642 --> 52:40.594
We also shared these results of that community survey with Mr. Hannigriff,

52:40.642 --> 52:44.138
and we're happy to share that information with any of the council members that

52:44.144 --> 52:47.814
are interested. We are glad that Council is continuing to engage

52:47.862 --> 52:51.626
on this issue, the current railroad operations, our safety issues for

52:51.648 --> 52:55.294
pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles in our Super Neighborhood and their

52:55.332 --> 52:59.242
quality of life issues because of the horns, noise, and impact of productivity

52:59.306 --> 53:03.114
for those traveling to work or school. Our survey revealed the following

53:03.162 --> 53:07.074
concerns. First extended and repeated block crossings for

53:07.112 --> 53:10.542
many hours at Lawndale and telephone by the Kip

53:10.606 --> 53:14.686
post office at Leland and Scott at Lockwood

53:14.878 --> 53:18.706
at Rusk and Harrisburg on Hughes Street at Polk

53:18.738 --> 53:22.146
and Harrisburg on Griggs at Redwood and Bobby

53:22.178 --> 53:26.434
Lee at the Gus Worthham Golf Course, blocking the pedestrian bike

53:26.482 --> 53:29.754
and Bayou Trail to Capitol Street for hours on

53:29.792 --> 53:34.566
Saturday morning. The Dumble and Harrisburg Intersections.

53:34.598 --> 53:38.442
And at 1500 Telephone Road near Sierrajo We

53:38.496 --> 53:42.134
also experienced regularly horn noise

53:42.182 --> 53:45.306
during the day and night and specifically illegal

53:45.338 --> 53:48.522
dumping along the rail line at 300 north

53:48.586 --> 53:51.434
67th street in Houston, Texas.

53:51.482 --> 53:54.686
77011 was reported. We thank you

53:54.708 --> 53:58.306
for listening to our concerns and giving us this form. The results of our

53:58.328 --> 54:01.966
survey are available by request. You can send the request

54:01.998 --> 54:06.162
to me and I'm listed under Super Neighborhood Council information.

54:06.296 --> 54:09.954
Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Stan. Appreciate your comments

54:10.002 --> 54:13.334
and your ongoing work on the issue as well. All right,

54:13.372 --> 54:16.838
we're now going to try for excuse me. Hold on,

54:16.924 --> 54:20.120
Amy. Council Member Gallegos would like to address you.

54:20.650 --> 54:23.738
Thank you, Amy. I just want to say thank you for being here again.

54:23.824 --> 54:27.674
I know you addressed us in the January meeting that we had.

54:27.872 --> 54:30.966
And thank you for representing the Eastwood

54:30.998 --> 54:34.270
Lawndale Wayside super neighborhood again.

54:34.340 --> 54:37.440
Twice in January and today. So thank you.

54:38.930 --> 54:42.394
Thank you, Ms. Din. Our next speaker is Ms. Erica Miranda,

54:42.442 --> 54:46.162
who is with us virtually. If you're online, speak up or

54:46.216 --> 54:48.290
hit star six to Unmute.

54:50.630 --> 54:53.330
Ms. Erica Miranda.

54:55.030 --> 54:58.454
Okay, we'll put a hold on, Erica. If you join us,

54:58.492 --> 55:01.446
please let us know or I'm here.

55:01.548 --> 55:04.630
There you are. Okay, very good. Go ahead, Ms. Miranda.

55:06.090 --> 55:09.350
Erica miranda. I'm an Eastwood resident.

55:09.950 --> 55:13.500
I just wanted to say maybe the city

55:13.870 --> 55:17.526
and the railroad can work on the low hanging

55:17.558 --> 55:21.178
fruit, meaning the easy things. I would think

55:21.264 --> 55:25.194
that it doesn't involve logistics because I work in logistics

55:25.242 --> 55:28.894
and I know how hard that can be. But I'm thinking putting up

55:28.932 --> 55:32.938
quiet stone signs does not inflict on logistics.

55:33.034 --> 55:37.170
So that's something that can be worked on. Also putting

55:37.240 --> 55:41.006
signs for alternate routes because there are bus drivers

55:41.038 --> 55:44.702
that are new and they don't know the routes around the neighborhood,

55:44.766 --> 55:48.262
it would be good for them along with bus drivers both

55:48.316 --> 55:49.640
school and public.

55:51.210 --> 55:55.222
Also, one of the roads that is used for

55:55.276 --> 55:58.754
an alternate route coming off is Broadmore.

55:58.882 --> 56:02.954
I know my mother lives between Broadmore and Munger and the

56:02.992 --> 56:06.860
speed sometimes people are going 40, 50 and

56:07.550 --> 56:11.146
maybe putting speed bumps or signs saying what the

56:11.168 --> 56:14.238
speed limit is would be good. Also,

56:14.324 --> 56:17.486
one of the roads that is used to do the

56:17.508 --> 56:20.942
back way to get access to the access road and then get

56:20.996 --> 56:25.362
into the neighborhood again is Knock Block Street. So that

56:25.416 --> 56:29.374
street is very there's a lot of potholes.

56:29.422 --> 56:33.154
It's very narrow and it does need to be fixed, I think for the

56:33.192 --> 56:37.954
time being until data is put

56:37.992 --> 56:41.622
together and a long term or midterm solution is done,

56:41.676 --> 56:44.870
maybe something like this can be a short term solution.

56:45.690 --> 56:49.414
And also on the long term to think whether it's an

56:49.452 --> 56:52.842
overpass or an underpass, think of the people that

56:52.896 --> 56:57.050
walk. I know my mom walks to the grocery store,

56:57.120 --> 57:00.218
so sometimes she's stuck waiting for the train

57:00.304 --> 57:04.026
to start moving and sometimes she's waiting two or 3 hours because of

57:04.048 --> 57:07.738
the whole COVID thing. She was not taking public transportation,

57:07.834 --> 57:11.246
but instead she was walking and so her trip to

57:11.268 --> 57:14.750
the grocery store, even though it's a 45 minutes walk for her,

57:14.900 --> 57:18.894
it would end up being a four hour transit

57:18.942 --> 57:21.954
time because she needed to wait for the train. Thank you,

57:22.072 --> 57:25.374
Miranda. Move on. Thank you. Ms. Miranda. Council member Gallegos

57:25.422 --> 57:28.958
would like to respond. Thank you, chair.

57:29.134 --> 57:32.966
Ms. Minonda, you had mentioned that you were hoping that we

57:32.988 --> 57:35.718
could have some kind of signs or something to let people know that there's a

57:35.724 --> 57:39.010
train, therefore they don't spend their time going to that crossing.

57:39.170 --> 57:43.114
I know that the public works has reached out to my office

57:43.312 --> 57:47.114
and they are working on some digital boards. I believe

57:47.152 --> 57:50.746
there's one going up at Lawndale near Griggs. I believe there's one on

57:50.768 --> 57:54.814
Wayside, and I'm not sure where the other 1 may go,

57:55.012 --> 57:58.670
but hopefully in the near future, that will be tied into

57:58.740 --> 58:02.014
the Smart railroad crossing. So that way it

58:02.052 --> 58:06.094
lets the drivers know that there's a train, for example, at the 5200

58:06.132 --> 58:09.346
block of Lawndale, and therefore the driver doesn't have to spend

58:09.368 --> 58:12.594
their time going over there to find out there's a train blocking the

58:12.632 --> 58:16.014
crossing. Thank you. Thanks again, Ms. Miranda,

58:16.062 --> 58:19.782
for being with us. And thank you for your question. Next,

58:19.836 --> 58:23.542
we'll hear from Mr. Brandon Martindale, who's with us

58:23.596 --> 58:24.390
virtually.

58:27.610 --> 58:31.122
Or are you here in person? Mr. Martindale,

58:31.186 --> 58:35.018
we've got you as being with us present, but I do not see you

58:35.104 --> 58:38.298
take a second to look for you again. No.

58:38.384 --> 58:42.310
And we'll go on to the next speaker, Mr. Kyle Rogers,

58:42.390 --> 58:45.866
online. Mr. Rogers, can you

58:45.968 --> 58:49.260
speak up or hit star six to join us?

58:51.630 --> 58:54.060
Hearing none, looking online.

58:56.710 --> 59:00.386
We'll call you again, Mr. Kyle Rogers virtually with

59:00.408 --> 59:05.010
us, otherwise proceeding next to Sarah Gutierrez.

59:05.990 --> 59:08.390
Ms. Gutierrez with us online,

59:08.540 --> 59:12.246
presumably, if you can hit star six

59:12.348 --> 59:13.720
or speak up.

59:16.890 --> 59:19.846
It's been a long meeting. Folks may be getting some lunch. Ms.

59:19.878 --> 59:22.060
Gutierrez, last call for you.

59:23.390 --> 59:27.210
Otherwise, we'll move on to

59:27.360 --> 59:31.030
Ms. Virginia Ivanias. Ms. Ivanyez,

59:31.110 --> 59:33.930
if you are with us virtually,

59:35.010 --> 59:38.254
we'll take a moment to hear from you or hit star six if you can

59:38.292 --> 59:41.966
unmute and we're not seeing you online.

59:42.148 --> 59:45.394
Can you hear me? This is Kyle Rogers. I'm sorry,

59:45.432 --> 59:48.706
go ahead. Kyle Rogers with us. Thank you, Kyle, for joining. We can hear

59:48.728 --> 59:52.820
you. Why don't you go ahead? Okay, thank you.

59:53.430 --> 59:57.730
Hello. At a recent three day NTSB national

59:57.810 --> 1:00:01.410
Transportation Safety Board hearing on rail inefficiency,

1:00:01.490 --> 1:00:05.698
a former BNSF supervisor stated that BNSF

1:00:05.794 --> 1:00:09.802
utilizes public crossings as parking lots because its acceptable train

1:00:09.856 --> 1:00:12.490
lengths exceed rail yard capacity.

1:00:14.110 --> 1:00:17.514
Should public streets be used as de facto yards? I would

1:00:17.552 --> 1:00:21.274
say no. But I want to know what does BNSF think?

1:00:21.392 --> 1:00:25.280
What does up think? What does the FRA think?

1:00:26.690 --> 1:00:30.446
What is an internally acceptable stoppage time for

1:00:30.468 --> 1:00:34.278
a train to be blocking an upgrade track crossing?

1:00:34.394 --> 1:00:37.170
Is it 30 minutes, 60 minutes?

1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:38.740
120?

1:00:40.950 --> 1:00:44.974
What are the reasons for the frequent blockages near BNSF

1:00:45.022 --> 1:00:49.254
south yard, nearby telephone Lawndale and Polk to

1:00:49.292 --> 1:00:52.774
up? What are the reasons for the frequent blockages at the

1:00:52.812 --> 1:00:56.630
Galveston sub between Milby and Altic? Is it train length?

1:00:57.290 --> 1:01:00.914
What investments or operational changes is BNSF

1:01:00.962 --> 1:01:04.666
and up are making to reduce those blockages? We need

1:01:04.688 --> 1:01:08.474
to know this. As of the last available data, trains are

1:01:08.512 --> 1:01:12.570
stopping for over an hour on average, at the Galveston subline.

1:01:14.610 --> 1:01:18.650
We want to work together with the city, federal regulators and railroads.

1:01:18.730 --> 1:01:22.126
We have data. We can give you this data. But if you

1:01:22.148 --> 1:01:25.538
would like something in return but we would like something in return.

1:01:25.624 --> 1:01:29.486
We want minimal blockages. Children are frequently

1:01:29.518 --> 1:01:32.914
tardied to school, affecting education. Goods are held up at these

1:01:32.952 --> 1:01:36.226
blockages, affecting commerce. First responders are

1:01:36.248 --> 1:01:40.038
rerouted during emergencies, affecting safety and health.

1:01:40.204 --> 1:01:44.022
We urge our rail companies to keep better

1:01:44.076 --> 1:01:47.746
blockage data and make it easier for the public to access. We urge

1:01:47.778 --> 1:01:51.286
them to drastically improve their operations, especially in the East

1:01:51.318 --> 1:01:55.354
End. We urge the federal representatives and regulators to look at how

1:01:55.392 --> 1:01:59.670
railroads are operating and change the rules and laws to limit unnecessary,

1:01:59.830 --> 1:02:03.898
unpredictable, and unprecedented blockages on our streets.

1:02:04.074 --> 1:02:07.066
And lastly, we urge our city, county,

1:02:07.098 --> 1:02:11.022
and state officials to help catalyze cooperation between us all.

1:02:11.156 --> 1:02:14.874
To this end, we encourage any and all funding that will alleviate

1:02:14.922 --> 1:02:18.082
our pain and be sought out and applications to be made.

1:02:18.136 --> 1:02:21.294
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Rogers. Great question, and I appreciate

1:02:21.342 --> 1:02:24.994
your willingness to offer that data. We do have the

1:02:25.032 --> 1:02:28.486
representative, Ms. Davis from BNSF, responding to your

1:02:28.508 --> 1:02:30.070
question. Ms. Davis.

1:02:32.810 --> 1:02:34.790
Sir, thank you very much for sharing.

1:02:37.050 --> 1:02:40.406
Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much

1:02:40.428 --> 1:02:43.946
for sharing your concerns with us. We most certainly are

1:02:43.968 --> 1:02:47.594
trying to move our trains as quickly and safely as we possibly can

1:02:47.632 --> 1:02:50.874
through communities when there is an issue. As mentioned before, we try our best.

1:02:50.912 --> 1:02:55.070
Our crews work to address those issues and

1:02:55.140 --> 1:02:58.894
resume the movement of our trains. So we'll certainly take

1:02:58.932 --> 1:03:02.286
your concerns back and talk to our operations team and also work with

1:03:02.308 --> 1:03:05.646
Union Pacific to work on

1:03:05.668 --> 1:03:08.814
that coordination and that handoff of our trains going in and out of our yard

1:03:08.862 --> 1:03:11.780
as well. As I mentioned in my presentation before,

1:03:12.310 --> 1:03:16.322
communication can always be improved. And so we are committed to both

1:03:16.376 --> 1:03:19.958
communicating between our crews and our yard, as well as

1:03:20.044 --> 1:03:23.478
between up dispatching and our crews. Thank you,

1:03:23.484 --> 1:03:26.502
Ms. Davis. I want to thank you, Mr.

1:03:26.556 --> 1:03:29.926
Rogers, again, for being here with your question. And I think

1:03:29.948 --> 1:03:32.794
with that, we'll move on to the next speaker. And I'm told that Mr.

1:03:32.832 --> 1:03:36.314
Tom Thompson is with us online. I'm going to try

1:03:36.352 --> 1:03:39.610
that now. Mr. Thompson, can you unmute or identify

1:03:42.130 --> 1:03:45.840
hello. There he is. All right, sir, go ahead with your question.

1:03:47.650 --> 1:03:51.134
I'm sorry about the poor reception I have here.

1:03:51.332 --> 1:03:54.662
No worries. Go ahead with your question or comment.

1:03:54.826 --> 1:03:58.946
Sure. I just wanted to comment in

1:03:58.968 --> 1:04:02.558
the presentation from Director Davis and Ms.

1:04:02.574 --> 1:04:06.066
Summerlin, they pointed out some exciting new funding opportunities that

1:04:06.088 --> 1:04:09.762
maybe could be applied for some of the issues we're talking about

1:04:09.816 --> 1:04:13.734
here. Of course, it seems that all of them require some

1:04:13.772 --> 1:04:16.866
kind of local match. And that's where it gets tough

1:04:16.898 --> 1:04:19.800
for us because we have limited resources, as we all know.

1:04:20.190 --> 1:04:24.154
But several years ago, the voters of Texas approved a

1:04:24.192 --> 1:04:27.770
constitutional amendment that established

1:04:28.190 --> 1:04:31.494
a Texas Rail Relocation and Improvement

1:04:31.542 --> 1:04:33.900
Fund. This was back in 2005.

1:04:34.430 --> 1:04:38.186
Unfortunately, that fund has never been funded by the legislature.

1:04:38.298 --> 1:04:41.886
It seems to me that that could be a source of funding for the kind

1:04:41.908 --> 1:04:45.794
of projects we're talking about here that could

1:04:45.832 --> 1:04:50.130
be used for our match to get the federal funding.

1:04:51.110 --> 1:04:55.390
And I'm a member of Texas Rail Advocates. This organization

1:04:55.470 --> 1:04:59.094
is beginning a campaign now to solicit letters of

1:04:59.132 --> 1:05:02.706
support that can be submitted to the Texas

1:05:02.738 --> 1:05:06.422
State legislature prior to the 2023

1:05:06.476 --> 1:05:09.826
session requesting them to actually allocate funding to the

1:05:09.868 --> 1:05:13.386
Texas Rail Relocation and Improvement Fund. And I will

1:05:13.408 --> 1:05:16.554
be following up with emails to the council members with

1:05:16.592 --> 1:05:20.346
more information. Thank you. Thank you very

1:05:20.368 --> 1:05:23.638
much, Mr. Thompson, for making it to us and for adding your

1:05:23.664 --> 1:05:27.870
comment for the public record. Thanks very much. Thank you.

1:05:27.940 --> 1:05:31.978
Proceeding with our next speaker, I'm going to call again briefly, virginia Yvonnez,

1:05:32.074 --> 1:05:33.920
who I don't believe is with us.

1:05:34.790 --> 1:05:38.050
And following that call is one now for

1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:42.050
Batiri Bankston, who I believe is with us virtually.

1:05:42.870 --> 1:05:44.930
Batiri Bankston,

1:05:48.330 --> 1:05:52.114
we're looking for phone number and seeing none.

1:05:52.242 --> 1:05:56.722
If you're there, hit star six or identify

1:05:56.866 --> 1:06:00.262
otherwise. Moving on then to our next speaker is Mr.

1:06:00.316 --> 1:06:05.062
James Ganarelli. Mr. Gonorelli virtually

1:06:05.126 --> 1:06:08.154
with us. If you can speak up or

1:06:08.192 --> 1:06:12.186
hit star six to unmute join

1:06:12.218 --> 1:06:15.280
us with your who do we have?

1:06:16.290 --> 1:06:19.470
This is James gunrelli. Okay. Go ahead, Mr.

1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:23.098
Gunrelli. Go ahead. Thank you, chair. Thanks for allowing

1:06:23.114 --> 1:06:26.306
me to speak today. I've lived here for

1:06:26.408 --> 1:06:30.126
16 years in the same house in the Fifth Ward, and I've

1:06:30.158 --> 1:06:33.906
experienced all the issues that everyone else has mentioned

1:06:34.008 --> 1:06:37.874
from loud horns, lots of blockages, being stuck in a

1:06:37.912 --> 1:06:40.966
triangle where if you've got one behind you and one in front of you,

1:06:40.988 --> 1:06:44.338
you can't go anywhere. Hour, 30 minutes,

1:06:44.354 --> 1:06:47.698
delays getting to work, trying to do things in the evening.

1:06:47.874 --> 1:06:51.286
I'll submit the more details on these intersections

1:06:51.318 --> 1:06:55.434
and also where 18 wheelers are rerouting due to blockages that

1:06:55.472 --> 1:06:58.620
will shake my bed at 530 in the morning.

1:06:58.990 --> 1:07:02.586
And I'll send those for comment. Kind of ad

1:07:02.608 --> 1:07:06.462
living a little bit here because I learned a lot today listening to everybody

1:07:06.596 --> 1:07:10.430
and I noticed two themes that I would hope could be addressed.

1:07:11.970 --> 1:07:16.050
One of them is that the onus continues to be on the citizens

1:07:16.390 --> 1:07:19.842
to report the blockages through a website, a phone number,

1:07:19.976 --> 1:07:23.634
so many different ways or three step

1:07:23.672 --> 1:07:27.302
process on UP's website. I really then with

1:07:27.356 --> 1:07:31.586
Mr. Bounds in the pilot program noticed

1:07:31.618 --> 1:07:35.394
that more passive gathering of the data continuously

1:07:35.442 --> 1:07:38.322
real time is going to provide much more benefit.

1:07:38.466 --> 1:07:42.186
So the second part of it is there seems to

1:07:42.208 --> 1:07:45.546
be so much request for funding that

1:07:45.568 --> 1:07:49.482
will have to be out there that either comes from federal tax dollars, property tax

1:07:49.536 --> 1:07:52.790
dollars, local match, everything else. And I noticed with

1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:55.070
all those partners that were listed,

1:07:56.290 --> 1:07:59.514
we unfortunately didn't see Union Pacific

1:07:59.562 --> 1:08:03.086
as one of them on there. So I would hope that they could

1:08:03.108 --> 1:08:06.490
be a willing partner, especially with as cheap as he said so that we

1:08:06.500 --> 1:08:09.858
can hopefully turn this from not just a pilot program,

1:08:09.944 --> 1:08:13.442
but more into a much more continuous one and

1:08:13.496 --> 1:08:17.462
to touch on what everyone else has said. I remember in 2007

1:08:17.516 --> 1:08:21.526
when Mayor Bill White took a helicopter around and

1:08:21.628 --> 1:08:25.266
spoke about the arrogance of the stops trains

1:08:25.298 --> 1:08:28.902
that were around here. And since 2007,

1:08:29.036 --> 1:08:33.338
Union Pacific has spent $48.2 billion

1:08:33.504 --> 1:08:36.906
on stock buyback. Thank you very much Mr. Generally appreciate your

1:08:36.928 --> 1:08:40.138
comment. Your time has expired. Appreciate that point.

1:08:40.224 --> 1:08:43.626
And with up here still in

1:08:43.648 --> 1:08:47.614
the chamber today, I think your point is a strong one

1:08:47.652 --> 1:08:50.954
for how they might continue to step up or further

1:08:51.002 --> 1:08:54.238
step up. So I appreciate that comment from you for the

1:08:54.244 --> 1:08:58.162
record today. Thanks again for being here. And our next

1:08:58.216 --> 1:09:01.106
speaker on our list will move now to Mr.

1:09:01.208 --> 1:09:04.434
Oscar Aguilar, who I believe is

1:09:04.472 --> 1:09:07.954
with us in the chamber. Yes, sir. If you would come forward to the podium

1:09:08.002 --> 1:09:11.174
and state your name for the record,

1:09:11.292 --> 1:09:13.240
we'd appreciate hearing from you,

1:09:15.930 --> 1:09:19.846
Mr. Aguilar. Thank you,

1:09:19.868 --> 1:09:23.330
Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. Committee members, I'm Oscar Aguilar,

1:09:23.410 --> 1:09:27.274
General Counsel for State Senator Carol Alvarado, and today I'm here on her behalf and

1:09:27.312 --> 1:09:30.250
I will be reading a statement from her. Dear committee members,

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:34.170
as a native of the East End, I have witnessed firsthand the logical and quality

1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:37.754
of life issues that have resulted from the Blocket crossings

1:09:37.802 --> 1:09:41.822
in the East End. Rail traffic has long kept our communities isolated from

1:09:41.876 --> 1:09:45.326
each other, and as important as rail traffic is, the ability of

1:09:45.348 --> 1:09:48.894
our community to remain connected is much more paramount. My district

1:09:48.942 --> 1:09:52.814
office is located at the intersection of Lockwood and Harrisburg alongside

1:09:52.862 --> 1:09:56.018
a BC rail line in the East End. On a

1:09:56.024 --> 1:09:59.298
weekly basis, trains luggagely move through the neighborhood, often stopping

1:09:59.314 --> 1:10:02.470
and blocking multiple crossings along the track.

1:10:02.540 --> 1:10:05.874
Consequently, many of my constituents daily routines are often thrown

1:10:05.922 --> 1:10:09.494
off by the extensive weights and unnecessary detours that these

1:10:09.532 --> 1:10:12.922
blockages cause. Moreover, first responders often drive

1:10:12.976 --> 1:10:16.966
our office responding to calls for service, only to find block crossings

1:10:17.078 --> 1:10:20.474
putting further distance between them and where they're needed. The train

1:10:20.512 --> 1:10:23.946
disruptions largely affect the communities I represent, and I am glad to

1:10:23.968 --> 1:10:27.566
see the city of Houston is working towards a solution. I appreciate the

1:10:27.588 --> 1:10:31.434
initiative that the Houston City Council is taking to find solution to this ongoing

1:10:31.482 --> 1:10:35.594
problem. The Smart Railroad Crossing Monitors pilot program includes several

1:10:35.642 --> 1:10:38.818
BC crossings in my district, and I'm eager to review the data that

1:10:38.824 --> 1:10:42.130
the program will produce. The federal funding solutions discussed today

1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:45.362
are also a. Good step in the right direction. And I look forward

1:10:45.416 --> 1:10:49.074
to your input on how state resources can be used to address the issue.

1:10:49.192 --> 1:10:53.142
We must continue the discourse so that rail companies know that this is

1:10:53.196 --> 1:10:56.854
an issue that can no longer be ignored and an issue that will

1:10:56.892 --> 1:11:00.246
take significant action from their part to address. I look forward to

1:11:00.268 --> 1:11:03.402
our continued work together to address the transportation and quality

1:11:03.456 --> 1:11:06.954
of life needs of Houston and Senate District Six.

1:11:07.072 --> 1:11:11.146
Sincerely, Carol Alvarado, state Senator for District Six. Thank you.

1:11:11.168 --> 1:11:15.118
Thank you very much, Mr. Aguilar, and for the letter that is here

1:11:15.204 --> 1:11:19.582
submitted for the record. Thank you to her and for her involvement as

1:11:19.636 --> 1:11:23.386
a member of the Senate Transportation Committee. I know we're

1:11:23.418 --> 1:11:27.646
very grateful for her service and for yours as well. Council Member Gallegos.

1:11:27.838 --> 1:11:32.002
Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Mr. Aguilar. And also thank

1:11:32.136 --> 1:11:35.746
Senator Alvarado for the letter and for her support

1:11:35.848 --> 1:11:38.994
in our efforts to address this issue.

1:11:39.112 --> 1:11:42.774
Thank you. Thank you. Council member. Thank you, Chairman. Yes, sir. And thanks

1:11:42.812 --> 1:11:46.258
for getting that onto the record. Returning now for a moment to our speaker.

1:11:46.274 --> 1:11:49.766
We understand Batiri Bankson is with

1:11:49.788 --> 1:11:51.910
us online. Ms. Bankson,

1:11:57.350 --> 1:12:01.670
Batiri Bankston told

1:12:01.740 --> 1:12:05.190
that you're with us online. If not, we will proceed.

1:12:05.930 --> 1:12:08.890
Hit star Six or let us know you're there.

1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:12.666
Otherwise we'll move on in the chamber. I believe with us

1:12:12.688 --> 1:12:16.202
is Mr. Tony Garcia. Mr.

1:12:16.256 --> 1:12:19.294
Garcia is here with us. If you'll come forward and

1:12:19.332 --> 1:12:22.878
identify yourself, we'd love to hear your comment or question for the

1:12:22.964 --> 1:12:25.694
committees assembled today. Thank you, Mr.

1:12:25.732 --> 1:12:29.006
Garcia. Thank you, Chair Robinson. Thank you,

1:12:29.028 --> 1:12:32.126
Chair Gagos. So for those of you that don't know me,

1:12:32.148 --> 1:12:36.142
I'm Tony Garcia. I'm a local East End resident. I'm a businessman,

1:12:36.286 --> 1:12:40.930
community leader, philanthropist, and all around just community servant.

1:12:41.910 --> 1:12:45.714
As I was here in this meeting today, I was just blown away by the

1:12:45.752 --> 1:12:48.886
things that I've been hearing. And I just want to give you my point

1:12:48.908 --> 1:12:52.566
of view. From my perspective, the number ten comes to mind,

1:12:52.748 --> 1:12:56.354
and that is my everyday task. It's ten. It's ten railroad

1:12:56.402 --> 1:13:00.330
crossings that are blocked while I'm trying to access my child,

1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:03.926
to get them to school, to see my mother, who is a grandmother

1:13:03.958 --> 1:13:07.402
and an elderly woman, reporting to my office,

1:13:07.536 --> 1:13:11.402
reporting to several of my businesses and reporting to my cafe.

1:13:11.546 --> 1:13:15.566
Ten crossings every day that are blocked in

1:13:15.588 --> 1:13:19.882
the East End. Resident that's Lawndale. Leland Lockwood.

1:13:19.946 --> 1:13:24.850
Milby Oakhurst. Polk. Scott samson,

1:13:25.990 --> 1:13:29.758
Ernestine. And if I missed a few, my apologies.

1:13:29.934 --> 1:13:33.426
This just has to stop. I do business elsewhere in

1:13:33.448 --> 1:13:37.186
Houston and throughout Texas. And I can share with you that I don't encounter

1:13:37.218 --> 1:13:40.998
ten blockings anywhere in Houston other than the East End. So at

1:13:41.004 --> 1:13:43.430
what point did our lives become less valuable?

1:13:43.770 --> 1:13:48.390
At what point did the city say it's okay for up and BNSF

1:13:48.470 --> 1:13:52.634
to just park your trains on our tracks? This must stop now.

1:13:52.832 --> 1:13:56.186
I heard earlier about detections and cameras and

1:13:56.368 --> 1:13:59.878
quiet zones and how they know how they can detect when they're

1:13:59.894 --> 1:14:03.982
approaching a quiet zone. Well, clearly an engineer is certain

1:14:04.036 --> 1:14:07.150
he's blocking a track. They know what they're doing.

1:14:07.220 --> 1:14:10.474
And I can't imagine that it's anything from mechanical failure

1:14:10.522 --> 1:14:14.066
when it happens on a routine basis. Every single day

1:14:14.248 --> 1:14:16.930
they deliberately block our tracks.

1:14:18.230 --> 1:14:22.318
It's hindering our quality of life. It's a safety hazard.

1:14:22.414 --> 1:14:26.018
It's as if every single day we parked a train

1:14:26.104 --> 1:14:29.654
outside your home, BNSF and up, and said, you can't get out,

1:14:29.692 --> 1:14:33.766
you can't go to the hospital, you can't take your child to school. We're just

1:14:33.788 --> 1:14:35.800
going to park a track outside your house.

1:14:37.370 --> 1:14:40.886
That's all I have. My name is Tony Garcia, and I thank

1:14:40.908 --> 1:14:44.154
you for the time. Well, thank you, Mr. Garcia, for paying attention and for being

1:14:44.192 --> 1:14:47.590
with us. Council Member Gallegos would like to address you. Thank you, Chair.

1:14:47.670 --> 1:14:50.198
And thank you, Tony, for your time, for being here. I know you're a busy

1:14:50.214 --> 1:14:53.726
man, and I know you are very active in the East End, so thank you

1:14:53.748 --> 1:14:56.986
for everything you do for our communities in the East

1:14:57.018 --> 1:15:00.526
End. And like you stated, Leland, I know

1:15:00.548 --> 1:15:03.634
you have one of your offices there on Leland, just a block or so away

1:15:03.672 --> 1:15:06.990
from the railroad track. So I can only imagine the frustration

1:15:07.070 --> 1:15:10.674
that you and your employees go through not

1:15:10.712 --> 1:15:13.890
able to get across that railroad track.

1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:17.094
So, again, thank you for everything that you do. Thank you. Mr.

1:15:17.132 --> 1:15:20.278
Garcia, if you would entertain one comment from

1:15:20.364 --> 1:15:24.198
Chair. I know Council Member Gallegos and I were recently at

1:15:24.204 --> 1:15:28.134
the botanical Garden, or right adjacent to it for a track completion

1:15:28.182 --> 1:15:31.850
for part of our pedestrian and rail. And I rode my bike back

1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:35.834
from there and was through your neighborhood and witnessed myself a

1:15:35.872 --> 1:15:39.450
number of blocked intersections. And I know from

1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:43.134
my route that I've got an app on my phone where I know exactly where

1:15:43.172 --> 1:15:47.498
I went on that bike ride that day. And with your ten crossings,

1:15:47.594 --> 1:15:51.130
I wonder if you know such an app that you could map your daily route.

1:15:51.210 --> 1:15:55.454
Because what you just described to me is not only compromise

1:15:55.502 --> 1:15:59.346
of your personal quality of life, but one that also is

1:15:59.528 --> 1:16:02.942
representing what we're here fundamentally for today, which is public safety

1:16:03.006 --> 1:16:06.866
and the concerns that, among others, chief Pena described. So I

1:16:06.888 --> 1:16:10.534
would love to see what you described mapped. And if you need any help,

1:16:10.572 --> 1:16:13.798
let me know and I'll loan you mine. I appreciate that,

1:16:13.804 --> 1:16:16.406
and I will be certain to map it out for you and convey it to

1:16:16.428 --> 1:16:20.026
your office. Okay? Thank you for your time. Thank you, Mr. Ricarcia. Thank you,

1:16:20.048 --> 1:16:24.474
Council. Okay, our next speaker is with us online

1:16:24.592 --> 1:16:28.118
and virtually. I believe that's Mr. Andrew Wright, if you're

1:16:28.134 --> 1:16:32.430
with us, hit star six or speak

1:16:32.500 --> 1:16:34.320
up and we can hear you now.

1:16:35.730 --> 1:16:38.720
Mr. Andrew Wright, are you still with us?

1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:46.668
Okay, we're hearing from Ms. Virginia Ivanyez,

1:16:46.704 --> 1:16:49.832
who we think is online. If you're able to speak.

1:16:49.886 --> 1:16:54.424
We'd love to hear from you. Ms. Ivanyez hit

1:16:54.462 --> 1:16:56.300
star six to unmute.

1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:03.772
Not hearing you. We're going to move on. I do see Mr.

1:17:03.826 --> 1:17:07.716
Mark Klein with us in chambers. So let's move to your comment.

1:17:07.768 --> 1:17:10.876
Mr. Klein, I believe you're on the north

1:17:10.908 --> 1:17:12.850
side. I am, thank you.

1:17:14.340 --> 1:17:17.888
If you could. Chair Althorn and Chair Geigos and

1:17:17.894 --> 1:17:21.984
Chair Robinson. I appreciate it. I'm Mark Klein, president of Super Neighborhood Twelve,

1:17:22.102 --> 1:17:25.348
and I've been working on the 34th street quiet zone since 2010.

1:17:25.354 --> 1:17:28.340
And we've worked really long and hard.

1:17:28.410 --> 1:17:32.512
Thousands of residents support it. It was a crushing blow when, in 2011,

1:17:32.576 --> 1:17:36.036
the funding mechanism, which was rebuilt, Houston passed, and so the funding

1:17:36.068 --> 1:17:39.476
mechanism for quiet zones went away. And so we spent

1:17:39.508 --> 1:17:43.764
the next seven years, or at least I did, talking with Public Works jeffrey Weatherford,

1:17:43.812 --> 1:17:47.428
harry Hayes, ellen Cohen, formerly City Council,

1:17:47.524 --> 1:17:51.256
District C, and others. And we're told that there just wasn't

1:17:51.288 --> 1:17:54.732
any money and that we'd have to find skin in the game to

1:17:54.786 --> 1:17:57.996
get the city council to pony up its share. And I understand that.

1:17:58.098 --> 1:18:01.410
But the amount of money we were talking about at the time, half million dollars,

1:18:01.940 --> 1:18:05.136
that would be a momentous undertaking for any nonprofit to

1:18:05.158 --> 1:18:08.764
take, let alone a bunch of volunteers. And so we were 9th

1:18:08.812 --> 1:18:12.304
on the list when that list, eight of us, got completed. So when that list

1:18:12.342 --> 1:18:16.368
went away, this is a list that had been vetted by council, by staff,

1:18:16.464 --> 1:18:19.504
and then all of a sudden, we are facing that this has been reshuffled.

1:18:19.552 --> 1:18:22.708
And now 34th street quiet zone could be anywhere on the list. And I just

1:18:22.714 --> 1:18:25.768
want to make sure that it remains top of mind for

1:18:25.854 --> 1:18:29.540
you folks and City Council, we're talking about the largest quiet zone

1:18:29.620 --> 1:18:32.756
that would occur in Houston. It would impact thousands

1:18:32.788 --> 1:18:36.744
of residents. It would improve the safety for their elementary schools,

1:18:36.792 --> 1:18:39.790
high three high schools, the YMCAs on it.

1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:43.436
There are affordable housing, apartment complexes on it.

1:18:43.458 --> 1:18:46.716
And most importantly, there's an underserved community that has probably been

1:18:46.738 --> 1:18:50.216
underserved since it was formed in 1915. And that's Independence Heights.

1:18:50.328 --> 1:18:53.584
And this could be a huge improvement for them. And they just built

1:18:53.622 --> 1:18:57.264
that new high school, burke or two. Washington. It's an amazing thing,

1:18:57.302 --> 1:19:00.956
and I want to say that I'm always confounded by Burlington

1:19:00.988 --> 1:19:04.848
Northern that doesn't necessarily pay or contribute

1:19:04.944 --> 1:19:08.308
for some of these improvements. No one's asking anybody to pay the

1:19:08.314 --> 1:19:11.904
full amount of this, but they did make $7 billion in profits

1:19:11.952 --> 1:19:15.508
last year. And though some of those profits are born on the backs of residents

1:19:15.604 --> 1:19:19.668
living along these lines that suffer from the consequences of noise pollution,

1:19:19.844 --> 1:19:23.268
which research has shown to be as egregious as air pollution,

1:19:23.364 --> 1:19:26.644
but none of those costs are baked into those profits.

1:19:26.772 --> 1:19:30.076
And so this is an opportunity for a brand to really get out ahead of

1:19:30.098 --> 1:19:34.136
itself and to not only help its shareholders, but to help stakeholders

1:19:34.168 --> 1:19:38.120
in the community improve their lives, improve their quality of life. I've seen firsthand

1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:41.548
what noise pollution and the train horn can do. And so this is a

1:19:41.554 --> 1:19:45.308
great opportunity for BNSF to improve life for thousands of Houstonians

1:19:45.324 --> 1:19:48.816
and for city council as well. Thank you, Mr. Klein. Thank you very much

1:19:48.838 --> 1:19:52.144
for being with us and your appeal to the industry. We appreciate

1:19:52.192 --> 1:19:55.412
that very much. A few more speakers on our list.

1:19:55.466 --> 1:19:58.464
We will proceed with virtually with Ms.

1:19:58.512 --> 1:20:02.768
Ruby Thomas. Ms. Thomas, if you're with us at star six

1:20:02.954 --> 1:20:06.244
or start talking, ms.

1:20:06.292 --> 1:20:09.480
Thomas, Ruby Thomas looking for you online,

1:20:09.630 --> 1:20:12.904
star six. Otherwise we will move on.

1:20:12.942 --> 1:20:16.460
Our next speaker is Ms. Paulette Kukuk

1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:20.876
in the chamber today. Ms. Kukuk, glad you're with

1:20:20.898 --> 1:20:24.190
us. If you could take the podium and

1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:28.572
state your name for the record. Congratulations for saying

1:20:28.626 --> 1:20:32.048
my name correctly. Well, it's very difficult.

1:20:32.214 --> 1:20:35.376
Hello, I'm Paulette Kakuk. I am a director with the

1:20:35.398 --> 1:20:39.264
Eastwood Civic Association, and I would like to share some

1:20:39.302 --> 1:20:43.232
information in regard to the intersections blocked on the Galveston

1:20:43.296 --> 1:20:46.432
sub as a result of stop trains.

1:20:46.576 --> 1:20:50.036
This data was collected by a surveillance camera directed at

1:20:50.058 --> 1:20:53.960
the crossing at Eastwood dot number 85

1:20:54.110 --> 1:20:57.604
95 22 y. In March

1:20:57.652 --> 1:21:01.364
of 2021, 218 trains

1:21:01.412 --> 1:21:04.868
traveled this crossing, of which 26 stopped

1:21:04.964 --> 1:21:08.430
and blocked the intersection for a total of 20 hours.

1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:13.372
In March of 2022, we saw 188

1:21:13.426 --> 1:21:17.400
trains travel this crossing, of which 63

1:21:17.490 --> 1:21:21.232
stopped and blocked the intersection for a total of 73

1:21:21.286 --> 1:21:24.800
hours of blockages. That's 30 less

1:21:24.870 --> 1:21:28.960
trains, but 37 more blockages and

1:21:29.030 --> 1:21:33.936
52 more hours in a year to year comparison.

1:21:34.128 --> 1:21:37.520
This illustrates that this problem is getting much worse.

1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:41.476
Despite fewer trains traveling the track for the

1:21:41.498 --> 1:21:45.224
last six months. I've painstakingly recorded the

1:21:45.262 --> 1:21:49.176
details of every train that's traveled this crossing. Here's what

1:21:49.198 --> 1:21:52.952
we learned. We see an average of 163

1:21:53.006 --> 1:21:55.916
trains a month. Of those,

1:21:56.018 --> 1:22:00.136
34% of them come to a complete stop and block

1:22:00.168 --> 1:22:04.504
the road for at least ten minutes. The average duration

1:22:04.632 --> 1:22:07.310
of the blockage is 62 minutes.

1:22:08.820 --> 1:22:12.672
Each month, this crossing is blocked for a total of 56

1:22:12.726 --> 1:22:16.684
hours. On average, the longest single blockage

1:22:16.732 --> 1:22:20.144
was 8 hours and 38 minutes. We see

1:22:20.182 --> 1:22:23.510
at least one blockage of over 3 hours every month.

1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:28.196
This is just a snapshot of what it looks like in the East End.

1:22:28.378 --> 1:22:31.572
This is a single crossing on a single rail line.

1:22:31.706 --> 1:22:35.192
The impacts are similar at other crossings on

1:22:35.326 --> 1:22:39.732
other lines. We need the city to accelerate and expand

1:22:39.796 --> 1:22:42.840
its smart railroad crossing. Monitor pilot.

1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:46.036
I would like to ask council and staff,

1:22:46.148 --> 1:22:49.436
are there plans to regularly share the data from the

1:22:49.458 --> 1:22:52.588
pilot publicly? Thank you very much for your time.

1:22:52.674 --> 1:22:56.556
Well, thank you very much, Ms. Kokokin. I think the intention is very

1:22:56.578 --> 1:23:00.204
much to share that data. How we do that?

1:23:00.242 --> 1:23:03.436
I think we're taking a good look at it with the partners

1:23:03.468 --> 1:23:06.272
who've presented today. And I do see Mr.

1:23:06.326 --> 1:23:10.560
Hannigraff behind you, who presented earlier, who may like to approach.

1:23:12.980 --> 1:23:18.564
Can you please come forward, mr. Hannigraff, if you'd like to be on

1:23:18.602 --> 1:23:22.324
the record with your comment or response? No, I've been working really

1:23:22.362 --> 1:23:25.832
closely with the East End community and they have been providing us the data

1:23:25.886 --> 1:23:29.304
to help us compile the entire story along with

1:23:29.342 --> 1:23:33.316
our sensors. Excellent. And we know the concentration of railroad

1:23:33.348 --> 1:23:36.468
crossings in the East End, the triangle that Council

1:23:36.484 --> 1:23:39.864
Member Gallegos has been speaking of today. So we're grateful

1:23:39.912 --> 1:23:43.484
for your data collection, your observations, and for working with our team.

1:23:43.602 --> 1:23:47.656
Thank you very much. Thank you. We do. Miss Kakuk, if you'd

1:23:47.688 --> 1:23:51.180
hold on, council Member Gallegos would like to speak.

1:23:51.250 --> 1:23:54.876
Go ahead, sir. Thank you. Thank you, chair paulette,

1:23:54.988 --> 1:23:58.588
if there was an East End award, you'd be the recipient of the East

1:23:58.604 --> 1:24:02.752
End award for 2022. Can you please share how you

1:24:02.806 --> 1:24:06.464
gathered all this information? Yes, I'd be glad to. I bought

1:24:06.512 --> 1:24:09.968
a Wise camera for $30. I mounted

1:24:09.984 --> 1:24:13.336
it at the back of the house because the train track is right behind our

1:24:13.358 --> 1:24:16.824
house. And each day I look at

1:24:16.862 --> 1:24:20.744
the data that's collected from the camera and it

1:24:20.782 --> 1:24:24.472
records for 24 hours. I painstakingly look at each

1:24:24.526 --> 1:24:27.896
time there is a stop train and how long it stopped.

1:24:27.928 --> 1:24:31.704
I record it and I give it to Danielle,

1:24:31.752 --> 1:24:35.310
who converts it into a chart. Wow.

1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:39.468
So thank you. Thank you for taking your personal

1:24:39.554 --> 1:24:43.456
time to do this for our community. Thank you. Glad to. Thank you.

1:24:43.558 --> 1:24:46.848
Thanks. Ms. Cook and I had a Lionel train when I was a

1:24:46.854 --> 1:24:50.290
kid. I want your help building that next train set.

1:24:51.940 --> 1:24:55.588
You all are awesome. We may be down to our final speaker on

1:24:55.594 --> 1:24:58.624
the list before we call anyone who we've missed.

1:24:58.752 --> 1:25:02.900
Ms. Melissa Bealer, I believe you're with us virtually.

1:25:03.980 --> 1:25:11.000
Ms. Bealer, if you could hit star six or unmute going

1:25:11.070 --> 1:25:14.596
once, going twice, and ask again for Ms.

1:25:14.628 --> 1:25:17.820
Bealer to unmute or speak

1:25:17.890 --> 1:25:21.484
now and hearing nothing there, I'm going to call any of those who

1:25:21.522 --> 1:25:25.020
may have missed. And thank you,

1:25:25.170 --> 1:25:28.300
Chief. My chief of staff has

1:25:28.370 --> 1:25:32.428
done an incredible job. I want to thank Diana Caisedo,

1:25:32.524 --> 1:25:36.236
as well as Daniel from Council Member Gallegas's

1:25:36.268 --> 1:25:39.808
office, as well as Jordan from Council Member Alcorn's office, and the

1:25:39.814 --> 1:25:43.456
rest of our staff. You all are doing great work for us. Thank you

1:25:43.478 --> 1:25:46.868
so much. And we have been passed to two speakers who are with

1:25:46.874 --> 1:25:50.084
us in Chambers late editions. But we do want to hear from

1:25:50.122 --> 1:25:54.250
everyone. Mr. John Segovia. Mr. Segovia, if you're with us,

1:25:55.420 --> 1:25:58.936
please state your name for the record.

1:25:59.038 --> 1:26:02.312
And thank you for being here. Good morning,

1:26:02.366 --> 1:26:05.896
Council. If it's still morning. It's not, but good

1:26:05.918 --> 1:26:09.592
afternoon. My name is John Paul Segovia.

1:26:09.656 --> 1:26:13.576
I open up an hello? If you could hold on speaker,

1:26:13.608 --> 1:26:16.456
we'll take one more call in a moment, but Mr. Segovia,

1:26:16.488 --> 1:26:19.516
go ahead. Thank you. My name is John Paul Segovia.

1:26:19.548 --> 1:26:22.976
I opened up an art gallery in the East End about three

1:26:22.998 --> 1:26:26.508
years ago and it sits in between five train tracks

1:26:26.524 --> 1:26:31.104
on Samson and Rusk. So being

1:26:31.142 --> 1:26:34.420
there every day for the last three years, I get to witness this

1:26:34.490 --> 1:26:37.744
firsthand every day. So it's hard for my clients

1:26:37.792 --> 1:26:41.856
to get to appointments because of daily train blockage. The biggest

1:26:41.888 --> 1:26:45.636
thing here is the train horn abuse. Train conductors

1:26:45.668 --> 1:26:50.136
will blare their horn for minutes at a time and it's very

1:26:50.318 --> 1:26:53.608
annoying if you're trying to host an event there.

1:26:53.774 --> 1:26:57.748
You get trains on both sides coming in and it's just a constant blare.

1:26:57.844 --> 1:27:01.288
If there's trains parked on the track, then future trains

1:27:01.304 --> 1:27:04.488
will come through there and still continue to blare their horn. So it's

1:27:04.504 --> 1:27:07.908
like, who are they warning at that point if there's already trains blocking

1:27:08.024 --> 1:27:11.824
that area? So when can we

1:27:11.862 --> 1:27:14.368
expect the quiet zones to take place?

1:27:14.534 --> 1:27:17.250
Right? I hear everybody talking about this,

1:27:18.020 --> 1:27:21.776
but really, how hard is it to implement this? Why is there

1:27:21.878 --> 1:27:25.504
talk about all this budget and cost and cost effectiveness

1:27:25.552 --> 1:27:29.056
and all this? A human knows how to blow

1:27:29.088 --> 1:27:33.210
a horn, why is there money behind it? Right? So just educate them.

1:27:35.660 --> 1:27:39.732
I've taken pics and videos of being blocked completely on both sides

1:27:39.796 --> 1:27:42.968
and there is a housing development next door that is the

1:27:43.054 --> 1:27:46.836
Samsung Lofts. And so if I'm blocked in as a business and they're

1:27:46.868 --> 1:27:49.964
blocked in at their homes if anything

1:27:50.002 --> 1:27:53.244
were to happen, I know there's a chemical company that works next

1:27:53.282 --> 1:27:56.476
door. If that something were to happen, catch on fire, we have no place to

1:27:56.498 --> 1:28:00.316
go. And listening to the Fire in Chief expresses

1:28:00.348 --> 1:28:03.744
the concerns of being alert of train blockage made me

1:28:03.782 --> 1:28:06.992
realize this Uber technology has been around for twelve

1:28:07.046 --> 1:28:10.716
years now, and I work for a logistics company who has adopted

1:28:10.748 --> 1:28:14.416
this technology back in 2015 to monitor the driving routes

1:28:14.448 --> 1:28:17.744
of their trash trucks. Why is it taking the Railroad

1:28:17.792 --> 1:28:21.252
Commission so long to implement this technology? And you

1:28:21.306 --> 1:28:24.664
spoke about an app that you have on your phone and you're going to pass

1:28:24.702 --> 1:28:28.724
that information to my friend Tony Garcia. And why isn't the Royal

1:28:28.772 --> 1:28:32.840
Commission adopting this technology? Alerting the Fire Chief

1:28:33.340 --> 1:28:36.828
of train blockage. Thank you Mr. Segovia. And you have been

1:28:36.834 --> 1:28:39.944
joined at the podium from Ms. Davis, from the city. Ms. Davis,

1:28:39.992 --> 1:28:41.340
if you'd like to respond.

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.276
Okay, so as far as quiet zones go,

1:28:47.378 --> 1:28:49.330
as the previous speaker mentioned,

1:28:50.500 --> 1:28:54.320
priorities change and this is prior to me taking this role. And so

1:28:54.390 --> 1:28:57.916
we have added more signature programs like the Mayor Street

1:28:57.948 --> 1:29:01.824
Rehab Initiative to which we aim to

1:29:02.022 --> 1:29:05.796
redo 2% of our roads every year. We work very closely with

1:29:05.818 --> 1:29:09.124
the council members, the district council members on that.

1:29:09.322 --> 1:29:13.280
So since coming into this role, we have been moving some funding

1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:17.144
to the quiet zones. But there's a two part effort. So there's the part

1:29:17.182 --> 1:29:20.776
on the city where we have the five that we have right now that

1:29:20.798 --> 1:29:24.170
are pending, where we're doing our portion of that,

1:29:24.860 --> 1:29:28.184
whether it's upgrading the pavement

1:29:28.232 --> 1:29:32.168
markings or the channelization for the cars.

1:29:32.264 --> 1:29:35.564
So that is something that we do on our side. But it is an

1:29:35.602 --> 1:29:39.308
effort when we do the quiet zones, because there are times when

1:29:39.394 --> 1:29:42.952
there are things that need to happen on the rail side, and we can't compel

1:29:43.016 --> 1:29:46.128
them to do it, but we do partner with them on quiet zones. And so

1:29:46.134 --> 1:29:49.804
that's just generally what can take so long. And so I do have a staff

1:29:49.852 --> 1:29:54.052
person. Part of their role is quiet zones and part is school

1:29:54.106 --> 1:29:58.180
zones, but we are moving forward with the ones that are pending.

1:29:59.720 --> 1:30:02.964
Thank you for that discussion and explanation. We appreciate that.

1:30:03.002 --> 1:30:07.096
And without any comments or council members in

1:30:07.118 --> 1:30:10.744
the queue, we want to thank you for being here today. I didn't see that.

1:30:10.782 --> 1:30:14.696
Council Member Gallegos. Go ahead. Thank you, Chair. Thank you for

1:30:14.718 --> 1:30:18.456
being here today. I know you were asking about quiet zones there around Samson

1:30:18.488 --> 1:30:22.584
and York. Again, that's where we've submitted

1:30:22.712 --> 1:30:26.216
to Congresswoman Garcia and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson

1:30:26.248 --> 1:30:30.304
Lee for community project funding for

1:30:30.342 --> 1:30:32.960
that area right in there for a quiet zone.

1:30:33.460 --> 1:30:37.970
And it's estimated that it will cost about $3.6 million

1:30:38.340 --> 1:30:42.096
to convert those crossings right in there into a quiet

1:30:42.128 --> 1:30:45.616
zone. So I can only ask that you and your neighbors

1:30:45.648 --> 1:30:49.440
and businesses in the area please contact Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia,

1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:53.284
congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and let them know that the city

1:30:53.322 --> 1:30:57.156
of Houston has asked for them to secure some funding

1:30:57.188 --> 1:31:01.032
from community project funding, these $3.6 million

1:31:01.086 --> 1:31:04.184
so we can address that. Great. Thank you. Yeah. And then I will

1:31:04.222 --> 1:31:08.136
add that's the one of ours that's a priority for grade separation. And so we

1:31:08.158 --> 1:31:11.916
have that. We're at about 30% design. And so those are ones that

1:31:11.938 --> 1:31:15.704
when the notice of funding becomes available, again, depending on the criteria,

1:31:15.752 --> 1:31:19.084
that is one at the top of our list to submit to get the funding

1:31:19.132 --> 1:31:22.556
so that we can close the gap. And the Chair will note

1:31:22.588 --> 1:31:25.970
also that with our partnering with our federal friends,

1:31:26.500 --> 1:31:30.256
the aforementioned Congress folks, Sheila Jackson Lee and Sylvia

1:31:30.288 --> 1:31:33.744
Garcia, with the new return of potential earmarks

1:31:33.792 --> 1:31:37.172
and funding, some things

1:31:37.226 --> 1:31:40.432
have changed with the IIja, and we will continue to pursue

1:31:40.496 --> 1:31:44.020
every opportunity to work with those available funds.

1:31:44.100 --> 1:31:47.800
So thank you again, both, and Council member for your response.

1:31:48.220 --> 1:31:51.412
We're going to turn to our final signed up speaker,

1:31:51.476 --> 1:31:53.000
Mr. Juan Paras.

1:31:55.420 --> 1:31:59.470
Did I hear from here he is. Mr. Paras, thank you for being here.

1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:04.460
Coming to the podium, if you identify yourself

1:32:04.530 --> 1:32:09.180
for the record. Yes, sir. Thank you. My name is Juan Paras,

1:32:11.220 --> 1:32:13.170
and I live in the East End.

1:32:15.220 --> 1:32:19.104
Pardon me. Go ahead. Okay. And I

1:32:19.142 --> 1:32:23.252
live almost at the corner of Lockwood and Harrisburg and

1:32:23.306 --> 1:32:27.110
Rusk runs parallel to the Harrisburg rail line.

1:32:27.880 --> 1:32:30.704
And I've heard a lot of good issues raised,

1:32:30.752 --> 1:32:34.824
but nobody's raised the issue of why

1:32:34.862 --> 1:32:38.132
don't the railway arts just expand their railway

1:32:38.196 --> 1:32:41.560
yards facility so the trains can have a place to park?

1:32:41.900 --> 1:32:46.020
Because they're so often blocking our communities that I consider

1:32:46.110 --> 1:32:49.950
that their parking lot, their unofficial parking lot.

1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:53.644
And if they have to pay for parking there,

1:32:53.682 --> 1:32:56.430
I think we would generate a lot of money for the city.

1:32:57.040 --> 1:33:00.864
So that's just another idea. But needless to

1:33:00.902 --> 1:33:04.210
say, this is also an environmental justice issue.

1:33:04.740 --> 1:33:08.188
The East End is inundated with environmental justice

1:33:08.284 --> 1:33:11.728
issues, train traffic, 18 wheelers

1:33:11.744 --> 1:33:15.328
running on our streets, and numerous

1:33:15.424 --> 1:33:19.476
issues that impact our communities and standard of living.

1:33:19.658 --> 1:33:23.236
So I would propose that one of the ideas is to

1:33:23.258 --> 1:33:27.432
expand the rail yards or to penalize or give

1:33:27.486 --> 1:33:32.052
fines. Like when you're parking at a meter and it expires, you get a penalty,

1:33:32.116 --> 1:33:35.224
right? You pay a fine. If we had something like that,

1:33:35.262 --> 1:33:39.080
it may encourage the railroad industry

1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:42.492
to expand their rail yards and

1:33:42.546 --> 1:33:46.456
accommodate the traffic that's coming into Houston.

1:33:46.568 --> 1:33:50.412
Thank you, Mr. Paris. Thank you. Sounds so sensible and easy.

1:33:50.466 --> 1:33:53.804
I don't know if our chair of the regulatory affairs, who handles

1:33:53.852 --> 1:33:57.404
all parking issues in the ordinance, if you want to think about a levy

1:33:57.452 --> 1:34:01.824
for the train companies. Do we have any interest in responding from BNSF

1:34:01.872 --> 1:34:05.110
or up? Ms. Davis or

1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:09.030
please come forward, sir. Thank you for your question.

1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:12.500
Again, for the record, if you could identify yourselves.

1:34:15.420 --> 1:34:18.356
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is Tessa Minor from BNSF.

1:34:18.468 --> 1:34:22.196
I just wanted to respond to I'm sorry, I missed

1:34:22.228 --> 1:34:25.812
his name. Just wanted to respond, Mr. Paris, mr. Paras,

1:34:25.956 --> 1:34:29.496
I appreciate that. Unfortunately, the railroads were built hundreds

1:34:29.528 --> 1:34:33.000
of years ago, and Houston is built at city around the railroads.

1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:36.300
And so that limits our capacity to expand our yards.

1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:41.452
Okay, there's one answer. How about you, Mr. ZenTek?

1:34:41.516 --> 1:34:45.136
So, I would say the capacity projects that I was talking about going on

1:34:45.158 --> 1:34:49.164
at Inglewood, we are looking at what improvements

1:34:49.212 --> 1:34:53.004
can be made, some of which we had talked about earlier, between the signal upgrades

1:34:53.052 --> 1:34:56.256
as well as within the yard itself. So there are those projects

1:34:56.288 --> 1:35:00.096
that we're looking at continuing to make a number of various investments

1:35:00.128 --> 1:35:03.208
within the state of Texas related to our siding projects to

1:35:03.214 --> 1:35:05.000
be able to accommodate the growth.

1:35:06.380 --> 1:35:10.168
For the record, are you two and your companies both officially against a

1:35:10.174 --> 1:35:11.240
parking fee?

1:35:14.380 --> 1:35:17.912
I believe the fifth no. Yes, I'm against

1:35:17.966 --> 1:35:21.484
it. Jokes aside, appreciate creative solutions, and we are

1:35:21.522 --> 1:35:25.036
looking for ways in which to address these concerns. So thank

1:35:25.058 --> 1:35:27.592
you all again for being here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

1:35:27.666 --> 1:35:31.040
Yes, we're now at the end of our list.

1:35:31.110 --> 1:35:34.736
We have now a point where we'd like to make a last call for

1:35:34.758 --> 1:35:36.850
those speakers who have not.

1:35:39.620 --> 1:35:42.816
Hello? Can you hear me? We are calling for one last round.

1:35:42.848 --> 1:35:46.004
Yes, who's on the line, please? Hi,

1:35:46.042 --> 1:35:48.740
this is Melissa Bealer from Air Alliance, Houston.

1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:51.350
Say your name, please, one more time.

1:35:52.460 --> 1:35:55.956
Melissa Bealer. Melissa Bealer.

1:35:55.988 --> 1:35:58.970
Very good. Go ahead with your comment or your question.

1:36:00.220 --> 1:36:04.356
Thank you. Good afternoon, council members. Again, my name is Melissa

1:36:04.388 --> 1:36:07.864
and I'm with the transportation justice coordinator for

1:36:07.902 --> 1:36:11.416
air Alliance Houston, who envisions healthy communities

1:36:11.528 --> 1:36:14.110
with clean air every day for everyone.

1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:16.956
I don't want to take up too much time. I just want to say that

1:36:16.978 --> 1:36:20.636
we are in support of our neighbors and our community partners

1:36:20.828 --> 1:36:24.336
in requesting improved conditions to rail operations in

1:36:24.358 --> 1:36:28.284
Houston. We understand and also express

1:36:28.332 --> 1:36:31.776
the same frustrations that the community does in

1:36:31.798 --> 1:36:35.264
terms of the fact that while we are looking at solutions

1:36:35.312 --> 1:36:38.692
today with railroad companies, it's been a long time coming.

1:36:38.826 --> 1:36:42.212
And communities, these are the communities that often

1:36:42.266 --> 1:36:45.448
get the harms as opposed to the benefits of

1:36:45.454 --> 1:36:49.672
our transportation system. And there's definitely some

1:36:49.806 --> 1:36:53.796
cumulative impact issues compounding with pollution

1:36:53.828 --> 1:36:57.496
from the port and the highways. Communities are concerned

1:36:57.528 --> 1:37:00.956
about train pollution while idling as well. So that

1:37:00.978 --> 1:37:04.636
might be something that industry could speak to a

1:37:04.658 --> 1:37:08.044
bit in terms of whether or not the best

1:37:08.082 --> 1:37:11.392
available technology to reduce or eliminate emissions while

1:37:11.446 --> 1:37:15.280
Idling and while we deal with these train blockages are in fact happening

1:37:15.350 --> 1:37:19.564
for Houston. I also wanted to mention my own experiences

1:37:19.612 --> 1:37:23.216
with train blockages, having visited Magnolia

1:37:23.248 --> 1:37:26.324
Park when I was working with community members to learn

1:37:26.362 --> 1:37:30.100
more about the improvements that they'd like to see for the braze bayou trail.

1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:34.564
We tried to go visit a trailhead, the best trailhead

1:37:34.612 --> 1:37:39.300
that they can visit at capitol street,

1:37:39.460 --> 1:37:42.760
right behind the multi service center there.

1:37:42.910 --> 1:37:46.472
And a train was blocking the trailhead, so we had to go walk

1:37:46.526 --> 1:37:50.264
to wayside where it has very narrow

1:37:50.312 --> 1:37:53.756
sidewalk. It's honestly gravel in

1:37:53.778 --> 1:37:57.096
some places and not a sidewalk. And we're facing three lanes

1:37:57.128 --> 1:38:00.396
of oncoming car traffic. Thank you. Trying to go in like a

1:38:00.418 --> 1:38:04.112
single mile line. Thank you, Ms. Bealer, for your comments today

1:38:04.166 --> 1:38:07.010
and for joining us online. Thank you very much.

1:38:07.540 --> 1:38:11.092
I think Ms. Ruby Thomas may be online. We're looking again

1:38:11.146 --> 1:38:14.644
for Ms. Thomas. Ruby, are you there?

1:38:14.682 --> 1:38:17.590
If so, speak up or hit star six.

1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:25.392
I think we're having challenges with getting you online. We're going to

1:38:25.446 --> 1:38:29.360
call one last time for Ms. Virginia Ivanyez.

1:38:29.940 --> 1:38:32.530
Understanding you may have joined us back online.

1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:45.772
Understand, Ms. Thomas, you may be trying to unmute

1:38:45.836 --> 1:38:49.970
hit star six on your phone. Speak up.

1:38:50.340 --> 1:38:53.296
We'd love to hear from you. And if we can't hear from you, you can

1:38:53.318 --> 1:38:56.976
always submit your question to any of the chairs who are co

1:38:56.998 --> 1:39:00.380
sponsoring this meeting. That's council Member Sally Alcorn,

1:39:00.460 --> 1:39:04.320
council Member Robert Gallegos or myself, council Member David Robinson.

1:39:04.900 --> 1:39:06.290
So with that,

1:39:07.660 --> 1:39:11.012
I'm going to call for any final speakers.

1:39:11.156 --> 1:39:14.852
Last time for any speakers to hit SAR

1:39:14.916 --> 1:39:18.152
six or speak

1:39:18.206 --> 1:39:21.224
up. I think we have come to the end of our time. Council members,

1:39:21.262 --> 1:39:24.508
I'd like to thank you for being here, your staff and all members of the

1:39:24.514 --> 1:39:28.220
public, both online virtually as well as in the chamber.

1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:32.940
For final comments, let me call first on council member Robert Gallegos.

1:39:33.700 --> 1:39:37.328
Thank you, chair. I was in the queue. I just wanted to thank

1:39:37.494 --> 1:39:40.732
Mr. Padas for your years of advocacy

1:39:40.876 --> 1:39:44.496
in our community addressing environmental issues. So thank

1:39:44.518 --> 1:39:46.950
you for everything that you do in the community.

1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:51.412
Let me again thank all the public speakers who testified today and

1:39:51.466 --> 1:39:55.264
shared the very serious issues they're seeing and filling

1:39:55.312 --> 1:39:58.900
in our community due to poor rail operations.

1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:03.036
As I told up back in January, and I say to be an SF

1:40:03.088 --> 1:40:07.156
today, it is of utmost importance that the railroads

1:40:07.188 --> 1:40:11.256
work collaboratively with cities and communities to identify

1:40:11.368 --> 1:40:15.320
and implement mutual beneficial

1:40:15.400 --> 1:40:19.704
solutions. We can no longer accept prolonged

1:40:19.752 --> 1:40:23.568
blockages lasting four and 8 hours

1:40:23.734 --> 1:40:27.250
and even 14 hours. As it was learned today,

1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:32.364
blocking major thoroughfares and neighborhood streets leaves

1:40:32.412 --> 1:40:36.370
residents stranded, frustrated, and first

1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:41.460
responders must scramble to find alternate, longer routes.

1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:46.016
And as we all know, every second counts

1:40:46.048 --> 1:40:47.940
in emergency responses.

1:40:49.260 --> 1:40:52.632
Prolonged blockages are unacceptable and must

1:40:52.686 --> 1:40:56.376
be corrected. I ask the railroads to please work with

1:40:56.398 --> 1:41:00.152
us, to remain engaged and operate more

1:41:00.206 --> 1:41:03.784
responsibly. Finally, let me thank

1:41:03.902 --> 1:41:07.408
Director Jesse Bounds, jack Hanigriff,

1:41:07.524 --> 1:41:11.164
and all the partners recognized earlier for

1:41:11.202 --> 1:41:14.784
all they've done to get us to this point and for working with my

1:41:14.822 --> 1:41:18.784
office to bring this pilot to fruition. I really

1:41:18.822 --> 1:41:22.384
do appreciate their work and dedication. The findings they

1:41:22.422 --> 1:41:25.940
previewed with us today support citizen observations

1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:29.844
and complaints about blocked city streets and

1:41:29.882 --> 1:41:33.040
critical crossings. And as we noted,

1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:36.464
the data gathered through this pilot will be utilized

1:41:36.512 --> 1:41:40.276
to better understand, manage and control the impacts

1:41:40.308 --> 1:41:43.544
of block crossings and to inform and

1:41:43.582 --> 1:41:47.540
encourage data driven collaboration between communities,

1:41:47.700 --> 1:41:50.490
federal regulators, and the railroad companies.

1:41:51.100 --> 1:41:54.476
Again, thank you all and let's all continue to

1:41:54.498 --> 1:41:58.728
work together. Thank you. Thank you. Council Member. Council Member alcorn.

1:41:58.904 --> 1:42:02.700
Thank you, Chair. And thank you, Council Member Gallegos. I certainly can improve on that.

1:42:02.770 --> 1:42:06.224
What I do want to say, what I heard from residents today was about

1:42:06.262 --> 1:42:09.890
a comprehensive plan, some kind of knowledge of

1:42:10.260 --> 1:42:14.336
when your grade crossing or your quiet zone might be

1:42:14.438 --> 1:42:18.004
in the queue. So I want to talk more with public Works about

1:42:18.042 --> 1:42:21.204
a comprehensive plan to address these, especially with all these

1:42:21.242 --> 1:42:24.756
infrastructure dollars available. Thank you to the railroads for

1:42:24.778 --> 1:42:28.976
coming. We need you. Our city economy, state and national economy

1:42:29.008 --> 1:42:32.296
need the trains. We all just have to figure out how we can better get

1:42:32.318 --> 1:42:35.416
along and be better neighbors. Thank you. Thank you,

1:42:35.438 --> 1:42:39.236
council member. And again, thank you to all of our participants today, those who've

1:42:39.268 --> 1:42:42.952
presented staff and council for their support and attendance

1:42:43.016 --> 1:42:46.556
today, I want to remind the public and urge the

1:42:46.578 --> 1:42:50.796
community to continue reporting instances of blocked crossings to

1:42:50.898 --> 1:42:54.960
www dot FRA dot

1:42:55.300 --> 1:42:58.348
gov blockedcrossings,

1:42:58.524 --> 1:43:04.656
and to call Union Pacific at 188-87-7267.

1:43:04.758 --> 1:43:08.524
Want to thank again council members Robert Gallegos and Council Member Sally Alcorn

1:43:08.572 --> 1:43:12.956
and their teams for participating with us. All of these presentations

1:43:13.068 --> 1:43:17.024
will be compiled and placed online for

1:43:17.062 --> 1:43:20.840
the public to see in future reference. And with that, I want to thank everyone

1:43:20.910 --> 1:43:23.160
again and. We are adjourned.
