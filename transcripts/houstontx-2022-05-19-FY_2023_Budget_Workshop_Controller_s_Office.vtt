WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:03.818
And I think this does conclude our special called BFA Committee

00:03.834 --> 00:07.374
meeting. So. Thank you, Controller. We will now begin our

00:07.412 --> 00:10.030
Controller's Office Budget Workshop. So,

00:10.100 --> 00:14.074
Controller, I believe at this time we're going to invite your Deputy Director,

00:14.122 --> 00:18.766
Leonard Polk, up for his presentation and give

00:18.788 --> 00:22.686
him a moment to get settled. And thank you again, Controller, for your

00:22.868 --> 00:24.270
words of wisdom.

00:27.010 --> 00:30.622
Okay. And I think

00:30.676 --> 00:33.882
our presentation is all queued up and essentially

00:33.946 --> 00:37.978
ready to go, so we're a little ahead of schedule, but we're

00:37.994 --> 00:41.226
doing great. So go ahead. You don't want to take a 20 minutes?

00:41.258 --> 00:43.666
No, we're going to get right into it. We're going to get right into it.

00:43.688 --> 00:46.802
I used to be in that chair. I remember how important it is to move

00:46.856 --> 00:49.860
people through. Yes, sir. Thank you. Okay.

00:50.630 --> 00:54.518
On behalf of the 53 almost employees working tirelessly to

00:54.524 --> 00:58.002
protect our City's fiscal health, I'm pleased to present the proposed

00:58.066 --> 01:01.746
FY 23 budget for the Office of the City Controller.

01:01.778 --> 01:05.626
As mentioned, Deputy Director Leonard Polk is here to assist me

01:05.648 --> 01:09.238
in answering some of the more detailed questions, but we'll

01:09.414 --> 01:13.002
go ahead and get

01:13.056 --> 01:16.326
into the presentation. First and foremost, the mission

01:16.358 --> 01:19.646
of the Controller's Office is project the financial integrity of

01:19.668 --> 01:23.102
Houston's municipal government. To accomplish this, the Office

01:23.156 --> 01:27.034
is responsible for managing all payroll and vendor payments,

01:27.162 --> 01:31.054
conducting audits, managing a $5 billion investment

01:31.102 --> 01:34.946
portfolio and a $14 billion debt portfolio, which we do in

01:34.968 --> 01:39.010
house, preparing accurate and timely financial statements,

01:39.350 --> 01:42.946
providing fiscal leadership on policy issues relating to the City's

01:42.978 --> 01:46.406
financial health. We are the independent authority to

01:46.428 --> 01:50.130
conduct performance reviews and audits of the City's Departments,

01:50.290 --> 01:54.182
and we assess the City and region's future financial outlook with

01:54.236 --> 01:58.890
accurate forecasts of projected revenues and expenses, among other indicators.

01:59.310 --> 02:03.174
As we'll discuss today, the proposed budget for FY 23 totals

02:03.222 --> 02:04.266
$8,954,843,

02:04.288 --> 02:08.054
and that represents

02:08.102 --> 02:11.310
an increase of 2.5% from the fiscal year

02:11.380 --> 02:17.040
22 budgeted amount of $8,730,277.

02:17.570 --> 02:20.306
So this increase represents a net change of $224,566,

02:20.328 --> 02:25.038
and that's primarily

02:25.134 --> 02:28.670
attributable to rising amounts in restricted accounts.

02:28.750 --> 02:32.514
So the increase in pension contributions, contractual pay

02:32.552 --> 02:35.080
raises for municipal employees as well.

02:35.610 --> 02:37.842
Of the total proposed operating budget,

02:37.906 --> 02:43.542
84%, or $7,548,436

02:43.676 --> 02:47.274
of expenses, are associated with personnel costs. So,

02:47.312 --> 02:50.778
similar to the overall City, the Office of

02:50.784 --> 02:54.346
City Controller does not have revenue to report, and there

02:54.368 --> 02:57.834
is no change in the FTE count from FY 22 to FY

02:57.882 --> 03:01.326
23. So looking at if

03:01.348 --> 03:04.750
we can go back sorry, one slide and the chart.

03:06.530 --> 03:10.142
Looking at our organizational chart, the Controller's Office.

03:10.196 --> 03:13.410
We have six divisions that help protect the fiscal well being of the City,

03:13.480 --> 03:17.614
its enterprises, and its component units. Our Operations Division

03:17.662 --> 03:21.438
is the workhorse of the six and responsible for making sure City employees

03:21.454 --> 03:24.514
and vendors get paid. Our Treasury Division

03:24.562 --> 03:27.762
is responsible for managing a 5 billion investment portfolio

03:27.826 --> 03:31.286
and a $14 billion debt portfolio. Again, both of those are

03:31.308 --> 03:35.254
done in house without outside managers. And our

03:35.292 --> 03:39.382
Audit Division is responsible for the audit functions of the City, including managing

03:39.446 --> 03:43.062
fraud, waste and abuse hotline. In total, the FY

03:43.126 --> 03:46.346
23 proposed budget of 8.9 million helps the

03:46.368 --> 03:50.062
nearly 53 Controller Office team members across six

03:50.116 --> 03:52.698
divisions accomplish these key tasks.

03:52.874 --> 03:54.030
Next slide.

03:56.850 --> 04:00.580
To highlight the roles and responsibility of the Controller's Office,

04:01.430 --> 04:04.930
we provide financial oversight of city operations.

04:05.430 --> 04:08.946
We develop financial reports such as the Monthly Financial Report and

04:08.968 --> 04:12.658
the annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the annual audit,

04:12.834 --> 04:16.530
and perhaps most importantly, we process payments

04:16.610 --> 04:19.942
to vendors and employees. And as

04:19.996 --> 04:23.542
defined in the City Charter, the Controller's Office is responsible for

04:23.596 --> 04:27.482
certifying the availability of funds for council action and

04:27.536 --> 04:31.610
the audit functions of the City and its reporting units. Next slide.

04:32.670 --> 04:36.314
So, as we mentioned previously, we don't have any revenue to report.

04:36.432 --> 04:39.706
So we'll go to the next slide, and again no

04:39.728 --> 04:42.640
revenue report. So we'll move on to slide six.

04:43.090 --> 04:47.230
So the total proposed budget of 8.9 million is 2.5%

04:47.300 --> 04:49.840
higher than the FY 22 budgeted amount.

04:50.610 --> 04:54.930
The FY 21 actual is 7,813,000

04:55.000 --> 04:59.170
946,000. And you can see the FY 22

04:59.240 --> 05:04.038
budgeted is $8,730,277.

05:04.124 --> 05:09.782
So the variance on those is 224,566,

05:09.836 --> 05:12.680
again, previously mentioned 2.57%.

05:13.370 --> 05:16.694
So we've seen a decrease in funding available for the audit

05:16.742 --> 05:20.886
function and that is something that I know we've discussed around this council

05:20.918 --> 05:24.646
table. Between the term

05:24.678 --> 05:27.994
or retirement pay and competitive edge among audit

05:28.042 --> 05:31.770
practitioners when compared to the private sector, our audit division

05:31.850 --> 05:33.760
is doing more with less.

05:35.570 --> 05:37.950
And we'll move on to the next slide.

05:40.070 --> 05:43.486
We can see the total proposed operating budget.

05:43.598 --> 05:46.446
84%, or seven and a half million of expenses,

05:46.478 --> 05:49.874
are associated with personnel costs. And of

05:49.912 --> 05:52.918
the remaining 16%, 1.4 million,

05:53.084 --> 05:56.854
a majority of expenses, 1.3 million. Of that 96%

05:56.892 --> 05:59.430
are associated with other services and charges.

06:00.810 --> 06:05.142
Next slide. In looking@the.net

06:05.196 --> 06:08.982
change to the FY 22 current budget,

06:09.046 --> 06:14.122
the FY 23 proposed budget includes an increase of $51,970

06:14.176 --> 06:18.262
as a result of service chargeback accounts for items such as fuel,

06:18.326 --> 06:21.966
electricity. It counts. It accounts an

06:21.988 --> 06:25.406
increase of 139,209

06:25.428 --> 06:28.830
as a result of municipal pay increases through the Hope contract,

06:29.270 --> 06:33.326
and a decrease of $9,090 due

06:33.358 --> 06:36.846
mainly to health benefit adjustments. So we're projecting

06:36.878 --> 06:39.700
a decrease of 4000 in auditing services.

06:40.550 --> 06:43.634
We have an increase of 20,000 for miscellaneous

06:43.682 --> 06:47.702
support services, a decrease of 20,000 for information

06:47.836 --> 06:51.254
resource services, and a decrease of 5000 for

06:51.292 --> 06:54.550
miscellaneous other services. Next slide.

06:56.430 --> 07:00.294
We see a major decrease in health insurance for active civilian

07:00.342 --> 07:03.626
personnel and that would be a reduction of $42,506.

07:03.648 --> 07:07.114
And we saw

07:07.152 --> 07:11.054
the increase of 134,141

07:11.252 --> 07:15.322
seen in the FY 23 Hope salary adjustment. And that's attributable

07:15.386 --> 07:18.814
to the contractually obligated pay increases that were

07:18.852 --> 07:22.930
negotiated earlier this year. Next slide.

07:26.170 --> 07:29.746
So, in summary, expenditure increases are attributable to rising

07:29.778 --> 07:33.414
amounts and restricted accounts. So it's really not anything that we're adding.

07:33.462 --> 07:37.974
It's all nondiscretionary. Those are increased pension contributions,

07:38.022 --> 07:41.290
contractually obligated, municipal employee pay increases.

07:41.950 --> 07:45.254
We've really tried to manage our budget very efficiently.

07:45.302 --> 07:49.114
I think we and Leonard sometimes gets frustrated

07:49.162 --> 07:52.558
with me, but we always go under budget. We're trying to be

07:52.644 --> 07:56.400
a good taxpayer steward. But I would say,

07:56.850 --> 08:00.926
in closing, if you look at the comparable amount of auditors

08:01.038 --> 08:04.750
to other Texas cities, namely Dallas, San Antonio, Austin,

08:04.910 --> 08:08.434
we're well below the number of auditors. And again, we talked about

08:08.472 --> 08:12.406
in the previous presentation about making investments to kind

08:12.428 --> 08:15.080
of save recurring money in the future.

08:15.530 --> 08:19.622
We've been and historically shown that we can find

08:19.676 --> 08:23.270
and utilize savings for the city through our audit division.

08:23.630 --> 08:27.286
So I would say some of the unmet

08:27.318 --> 08:32.506
needs I know people have asked about, that we

08:32.528 --> 08:37.526
really need more auditors. So we'll move on to the next slide that's

08:37.558 --> 08:41.280
questions. Thank you very much, Controller. I believe that

08:42.290 --> 08:45.598
covers quite a bit here and we've got a couple of council members in the

08:45.604 --> 08:49.098
queue. We'll start with Council member Sally Alcorn. Thank you,

08:49.124 --> 08:52.254
Chair. You don't have any revenues,

08:52.302 --> 08:55.570
but you make a lot of money for the city and treasury and investments.

08:56.070 --> 08:59.678
Can you talk about that? About what, like rate of returns

08:59.854 --> 09:03.238
for the past year? Yes,

09:03.324 --> 09:06.754
overall, we have seen interest rates

09:06.802 --> 09:10.118
rising. It's been, quite frankly, a little bit of a challenge in

09:10.124 --> 09:13.478
our investment fund. When you look at the yield curve and

09:13.484 --> 09:17.206
as rates rise, that yield curve tends to slope up positively.

09:17.398 --> 09:21.318
You have a principle of duration and that's the time that your investment

09:21.414 --> 09:25.226
is locked in. It's been a little bit of a dance to try

09:25.248 --> 09:29.318
and get that duration perfectly matched to beat

09:29.334 --> 09:32.954
the benchmark. We continue to think that rates are going to continue to rise,

09:33.002 --> 09:36.318
so we don't want to lock in something at 3%

09:36.404 --> 09:39.650
and rates go to 4% because then we leave money on the table.

09:40.790 --> 09:44.206
Equally complicating is the increase

09:44.238 --> 09:48.290
in rates on our debt portfolio, because the opportunities to refinance

09:49.670 --> 09:52.850
are now getting less opportune.

09:53.370 --> 09:57.720
Luckily, again, my background in investment banking, eight years

09:58.170 --> 10:01.350
working for an investment bank that primarily did fixed income,

10:01.930 --> 10:05.226
I knew that this low interest rate environment was going to be a huge opportunity

10:05.328 --> 10:08.490
for the city of Houston. We have

10:08.640 --> 10:12.700
to date received over $600 million

10:13.230 --> 10:16.742
in interest rate savings from refinancing

10:16.806 --> 10:19.840
the city's debt. We've been very aggressive with this.

10:20.210 --> 10:23.514
Other cities have been successful.

10:23.562 --> 10:26.526
I think Houston is maybe one of the most successful. We are one of the

10:26.548 --> 10:30.082
largest cities, so that number is quite high. But those

10:30.136 --> 10:34.002
opportunities are probably going to be less

10:34.056 --> 10:37.522
opportune going forward. But it's great that we did this,

10:37.576 --> 10:40.770
because when you look at that and that's city wide,

10:41.290 --> 10:45.286
but on average, a period of around 15 years

10:45.388 --> 10:48.662
of a weighted average. So this is $30

10:48.716 --> 10:52.230
million, $40 million a year that

10:52.300 --> 10:55.506
the city is not paying in debt service. So that's savings.

10:55.618 --> 10:59.274
We'll continue to identify those and be aggressive. It's just in this

10:59.312 --> 11:02.410
particular environment and it all goes up and down. Eventually,

11:02.750 --> 11:05.210
maybe the rates will come back down. We'll have more opportunity.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.570
Thanks. Thank you, council member. And thank you, Controller.

11:08.730 --> 11:12.014
Next we'll hear from council member Amy Peck. Thank you. And thank you,

11:12.052 --> 11:15.530
Controller. Related to the reduction

11:15.610 --> 11:19.194
in your audit division. As you know, I want to see more audits

11:19.242 --> 11:21.986
in the city and not fewer. So can you talk a little bit about what

11:22.008 --> 11:25.742
that reduction will mean in terms of how many fewer audits

11:25.806 --> 11:29.602
or what you're able to do less with the

11:29.656 --> 11:33.426
reduction? Yeah. So we'll

11:33.458 --> 11:36.534
use council office as an example. Those of you all

11:36.572 --> 11:39.862
council members have seen through these tough times

11:39.916 --> 11:43.814
with COVID and other reductions in

11:43.932 --> 11:47.826
overall expenditures, especially with costs

11:47.858 --> 11:51.450
like health care and pension and all these other things rising.

11:52.110 --> 11:55.706
Unfortunately, we have not been able to invest as much as we'd like to

11:55.728 --> 11:59.694
in the audit division. We would love an

11:59.732 --> 12:02.400
example of a great opportunity,

12:02.850 --> 12:05.854
if there was a way to find some of this federal money, to go out

12:05.892 --> 12:09.602
and hire more auditors. I was looking

12:09.656 --> 12:12.866
in my notes. Houston has about

12:12.968 --> 12:17.054
ten. We have ten auditors or ten total staff in our audit division.

12:17.182 --> 12:20.638
Austin has 28, Dallas has 20,

12:20.824 --> 12:24.120
san Antonio has 23. And so

12:25.850 --> 12:31.734
per employee, houston has one auditor per 2122

12:31.772 --> 12:34.790
employees, austin has one per 550.

12:34.860 --> 12:38.650
Dallas has one per 700, and San Antonio has one per 500.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.794
So they're a lot more in line. So just

12:42.832 --> 12:46.086
to wrap up, if someone wanted to and I've made this plea

12:46.118 --> 12:49.678
before if someone wanted to offer a budget amendment to fund

12:49.764 --> 12:53.406
more auditors using some of the fungible ARPA money,

12:53.508 --> 12:57.086
I think that would be a worthwhile investment. And I can tell you that if

12:57.108 --> 13:01.090
you look at the amount of savings versus the audit budget,

13:02.070 --> 13:05.442
it's a great return on investment. We spend a million and a half dollars

13:05.496 --> 13:09.086
a year in audit, but during the time I've

13:09.118 --> 13:11.854
been in office, I think now over 11 million in savings.

13:11.902 --> 13:15.478
So, again, I think it's a good investment, and I think with a

13:15.484 --> 13:18.934
bigger team, we could take on bigger audits and be more

13:18.972 --> 13:21.862
effective in finding efficiencies for the city.

13:21.996 --> 13:25.686
Thank you, Controller. That amendment is already on my list. All right, thank you.

13:25.788 --> 13:30.086
Thank you. Wish come true. We got a follow up question from Council Member Alcord.

13:30.118 --> 13:33.962
Thank you. It's my understanding we're not to submit budget amendments for ARPA money,

13:34.016 --> 13:36.060
but not to say that that won't happen.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.458
And then I was going to ask you about the paper reduction.

13:40.554 --> 13:44.042
I am a firm believer that the city still uses citywide

13:44.106 --> 13:47.646
entirely too much paper. And can you talk about what you're doing with the

13:47.668 --> 13:51.906
invoices and how you really are trying to go paperless in

13:51.928 --> 13:55.250
the Controller's office? Yeah, great question.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.540
We've been working on this for some time.

13:59.430 --> 14:02.934
Curiously, Harvey actually pushed our hand on a lot of these things.

14:02.972 --> 14:06.406
We've moved to DocuSign to digitally sign a lot

14:06.428 --> 14:10.230
of contracts, so that eliminates the movement of paper

14:10.380 --> 14:14.438
in the Controller's office. We have moved to eliminate paper checks

14:14.534 --> 14:18.154
and reduce invoices. There's still some work to do

14:18.352 --> 14:22.742
to get truly paperless invoices. And just like with the DocuSign,

14:22.806 --> 14:26.806
when we went through that process, we had five different departments

14:26.838 --> 14:30.718
that wanted to use each their own system. And in order

14:30.804 --> 14:34.606
to properly memorialize those signatures, everyone needs

14:34.628 --> 14:38.014
to be on the same system. We were able to essentially get everyone to have

14:38.052 --> 14:41.538
buy in. We'll need a little bit more buy in from all the departments to

14:41.544 --> 14:45.506
get truly paperless invoicing. But I would say that that is the

14:45.528 --> 14:49.326
future. I think even around the council

14:49.358 --> 14:52.958
table and us still signing a lot of these contracts that

14:52.984 --> 14:56.194
are paper, I know Leonard helps

14:56.242 --> 14:59.254
in every week going through with our team to

14:59.292 --> 15:03.170
sign off on all these contracts, but they're paper contracts that are being physically moved.

15:03.250 --> 15:06.566
And I would say that that's something that could be a huge savings

15:06.598 --> 15:10.060
for the administration to move to a truly paperless system.

15:11.230 --> 15:14.294
It's difficult to transition, but a lot of the other cities

15:14.342 --> 15:17.638
and smaller cities in this region, sugar Land, Paralym,

15:17.654 --> 15:21.534
Woodlands are using Or, Sugar Land and Pearland are using

15:21.732 --> 15:25.406
these types of systems. So something I think is a great idea. Thank you

15:25.428 --> 15:29.630
very much. And thank you, I think actually for the TTI committee,

15:29.710 --> 15:33.090
we've heard from the Houston Information Technology System

15:33.160 --> 15:37.022
about such technology being embraced and hopefully soon incorporated.

15:37.086 --> 15:40.578
So again, Controller, thank you for your remarks. I believe that's the

15:40.584 --> 15:43.810
end of our questions from council and staff.

15:44.150 --> 15:47.398
And with that we will move. I just wanted to take a point of

15:47.484 --> 15:50.866
personal privilege, please. I do have some staff members. If you'd

15:50.898 --> 15:54.202
recognize your team, that'd be great. You guys are always welcome. And I know

15:54.336 --> 15:57.834
we are in constant communication with many of you, but I wanted to

15:57.952 --> 16:01.334
recognize our Chief Deputy City Controller, Shannon Nobles,

16:01.462 --> 16:05.046
our Chief Operating Officer, and Deputy Controller

16:05.078 --> 16:08.390
Alex Obergon. Vernon Lewis is our Treasury

16:08.470 --> 16:11.894
Analyst, john Seideler is our Communications Director,

16:11.942 --> 16:15.294
and Sharice Mosely, who heads our Treasury Division. I want to just thank

16:15.332 --> 16:18.190
them and Leonard, as you all know,

16:18.340 --> 16:21.566
this is a lot of work and we a lot of times get up here

16:21.588 --> 16:25.058
and talk and look good, but it's these people that get us ready

16:25.144 --> 16:27.506
to be able to do the things that we do. So thank them and thank

16:27.528 --> 16:30.594
you all for your time today. Thank you, Controller. We know you have a great

16:30.632 --> 16:34.070
team and we appreciate all the work you all do upstairs.

16:34.570 --> 16:37.750
Thank you again. We've got two public speakers,

16:38.090 --> 16:41.718
both of whom we believe are online virtually and

16:41.804 --> 16:45.450
prepared with a question. And we'll start with Ms. Saba Blanding.

16:47.070 --> 16:50.346
Good morning. Good to ask you all some

16:50.368 --> 16:53.180
more questions today. Good morning.

16:56.210 --> 16:59.854
My question is, and this is, I believe, directly to

16:59.892 --> 17:03.326
council members, if you could add one to

17:03.348 --> 17:05.230
2 million to the current budget,

17:06.210 --> 17:09.426
if that magically appeared, what department and or service would

17:09.448 --> 17:13.010
you fund and why? Well,

17:13.080 --> 17:16.398
I appreciate that question and we'll commit

17:16.414 --> 17:19.874
it to the record. Ms. Blanding, thank you for that. I don't see any

17:19.912 --> 17:23.750
council members jumping to respond, but it is

17:23.820 --> 17:27.206
an interesting question, and we will consider what we would

17:27.228 --> 17:31.046
do with an extra million or $2. Thank you

17:31.068 --> 17:34.826
for that. Appreciate you being here today. Thanks.

17:35.008 --> 17:38.790
And next, we'll hear from Mr. Jason Oliver.

17:38.950 --> 17:42.010
Mr. Oliver, if you're with us on mute.

17:42.910 --> 17:45.900
Yes, I'm here. There you are. Go ahead, sir.

17:47.170 --> 17:50.618
So my first question is to the controller.

17:50.714 --> 17:55.114
Thank you for the presentation. Where are we in terms of the Checkbook

17:55.242 --> 17:58.862
program implementation? Is the data and

17:58.916 --> 18:02.930
information prepared? Some of us, if that information

18:03.080 --> 18:06.370
is available, some of us in the public would be interested

18:06.440 --> 18:09.854
in working on a version of it, depending on the city's timeline.

18:09.902 --> 18:13.634
So we're trying to get an estimated time of completion

18:13.762 --> 18:17.160
for that. And then the second question is

18:18.730 --> 18:22.114
to Council Member Robinson. You had mentioned that policy budget

18:22.162 --> 18:26.058
amendments will be out of order. I'm trying to figure out why the

18:26.144 --> 18:28.700
restriction on budget amendments this year.

18:30.750 --> 18:34.266
We're going to start with your first question, Mr. Oliver. Let's see if

18:34.288 --> 18:38.318
the controller has something to respond. So the

18:38.484 --> 18:41.786
now Open Finance, what we previously

18:41.818 --> 18:45.390
dubbed the Checkbook, that program

18:45.460 --> 18:49.140
that we started was started and halted and then

18:49.910 --> 18:52.786
restarted about a year later.

18:52.968 --> 18:56.900
From the most recent report I've seen, there's about 40% of the project

18:57.430 --> 19:01.282
that's been complete. I think the deadline is September,

19:01.346 --> 19:04.566
October of this year. But we

19:04.588 --> 19:07.894
would like to see that project completed and done because

19:07.932 --> 19:11.640
I think, again, there'll be a lot of opportunity to

19:13.050 --> 19:16.438
scrutinize expenditures and maybe find some more efficiencies.

19:16.534 --> 19:20.454
If not only the Controller's office but council

19:20.582 --> 19:24.266
and every citizen of Houston has the access to see in real time every

19:24.368 --> 19:27.930
expenditure, not just vendor payments, but payroll

19:28.010 --> 19:31.760
and other expenditures. So we've been

19:32.210 --> 19:35.806
cautiously optimistic that this project will get online. I would

19:35.828 --> 19:39.550
just add the genesis of this whole exercise

19:39.630 --> 19:43.346
was a joint effort between the mayor's office and

19:43.368 --> 19:47.154
the Controller's office to utilize and

19:47.192 --> 19:50.766
be eligible for a transparency star, which is the State

19:50.808 --> 19:54.086
of Texas financial transparency ranking system.

19:54.268 --> 19:57.618
And you get stars for different accomplishments.

19:57.714 --> 20:00.966
Namely, the first one has to be putting all

20:00.988 --> 20:05.290
of your expenses online. We're the only major city in the country that

20:05.440 --> 20:08.970
doesn't have our payments online. But unfortunately,

20:09.310 --> 20:13.594
we will not be eligible even if we do the Open Finance project

20:13.712 --> 20:17.130
for that transparency star. We'll continue to be the only major

20:17.200 --> 20:21.002
city in the country without the transparency

20:21.066 --> 20:24.554
star, in the sense that if you don't have five years of historical

20:24.602 --> 20:28.126
data, you don't qualify for the star. So I don't believe that the

20:28.148 --> 20:31.700
Open Finance has agreed to be able to put that historical information.

20:32.150 --> 20:35.618
It's something that we included in our project. So I

20:35.624 --> 20:39.154
would say I'm hopeful that the project will go

20:39.192 --> 20:43.106
online. I think it's going to be a great tool for not only council and

20:43.208 --> 20:46.722
staff, but also for citizens of Houston. And as a taxpayer,

20:46.786 --> 20:50.086
I want to be able to have this tool available to

20:50.108 --> 20:53.814
me, but we also need to push to put that historical data on

20:53.852 --> 20:57.402
there so that we are eligible to get that first transparency star,

20:57.456 --> 21:00.220
because the other stars we're already doing.

21:00.670 --> 21:04.230
We're already doing all the transparency stuff around the debt, the investments,

21:04.310 --> 21:07.562
but we cannot get those stars until you get your first star,

21:07.616 --> 21:11.246
which is the transparency portal and putting that five years of

21:11.268 --> 21:14.958
historical data on there. So I would encourage this body, to encourage the

21:14.964 --> 21:18.634
administration as a part of that project, to do the five years of historical

21:18.682 --> 21:21.986
data so that we can in fact get we would probably get three

21:22.008 --> 21:24.994
or four stars right off the bat. Thank you,

21:25.032 --> 21:28.642
Controller. And I do believe we're hearing regular progress being made towards

21:28.696 --> 21:31.954
that goal. So hopefully, Mr. Oliver, that addresses your first

21:31.992 --> 21:35.462
question. And as to your second point about the words

21:35.516 --> 21:39.042
I read at the beginning of the meeting, that coming from the administration

21:39.106 --> 21:42.486
is not a new restriction, but really the

21:42.508 --> 21:45.914
mayor focusing on amendments and trying to get ahead of those this

21:45.952 --> 21:49.494
year by reminding council members in our offices

21:49.542 --> 21:54.042
that policy amendments are not appropriate and will

21:54.176 --> 21:57.782
not be considered and to focus on the budget.

21:57.846 --> 22:01.114
So appreciating your comments. I want to thank you for being

22:01.152 --> 22:04.694
here again and I believe that brings us to the conclusion

22:04.742 --> 22:07.462
of the public speaking component of your presentation.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.754
Control Are. Thank you very much for being here and

22:10.792 --> 22:14.226
your whole team and thank

22:14.248 --> 22:19.038
you so much. We'll take a short break before our next presentation

22:19.134 --> 22:22.990
from the mayor's office. And with that, we'll take a brief

22:23.150 --> 22:24.210
adjournment.
