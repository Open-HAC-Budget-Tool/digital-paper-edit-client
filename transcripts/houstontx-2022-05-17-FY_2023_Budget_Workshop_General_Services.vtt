01:48.610 --> 01:52.426
Budget 23 template has been uploaded

01:52.458 --> 01:56.098
to SharePoint. And Mayor Turner, as we know, sent out a memo to

01:56.104 --> 01:59.826
all council members and offices to ensure productive discussions on

01:59.848 --> 02:03.486
the proposed budget. And all amendments are due Wednesday,

02:03.598 --> 02:07.686
May 25. Today we'll hear from

02:07.788 --> 02:11.974
General Services Department. Promptly on time, as always.

02:12.172 --> 02:15.350

02:16.090 --> 02:19.654
As a reminder, only people attending virtually are the public speakers.

02:19.702 --> 02:23.834
We'll get to their questions after the presentations and after questions from

02:23.872 --> 02:26.970
council members have concluded. At this time,

02:27.040 --> 02:31.194
I would like to welcome Director CJ Messiah and Mr. Russell Lee to

02:31.232 --> 02:34.390
provide the General Services Department budget.

02:34.550 --> 02:38.494
Thank you and welcome. And I see you have your department members with

02:38.532 --> 02:41.726
us. You all do a great job day in and day out, so thank you

02:41.748 --> 02:44.434
for what you do. Except you,

02:44.472 --> 02:47.940
Eric. That's my man.

02:49.990 --> 02:50.900
All right.

02:56.220 --> 02:59.816
Can you hear me? All right. There it is. Good morning and thank

02:59.838 --> 03:03.116
you for the opportunity to present the fiscal year 2023 budget for

03:03.138 --> 03:06.396
the General Services Department. I have three principles that I

03:06.418 --> 03:10.320
share with our GSD team, and that's integrity. First, service before self

03:10.390 --> 03:12.210
and excellence in all we do.

03:14.180 --> 03:17.532
With me today is my senior staff, which includes

03:17.596 --> 03:21.116
Chief of Staff Enid Howard. Assistant Director

03:21.148 --> 03:24.240
of Design and Construction and Real Estate, Richard Veylor.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.180
Assistant Director of Property Management, Eric Alexander.

03:28.760 --> 03:32.820
Deputy Assistant Director of Security Management, Robert Mansaw.

03:33.660 --> 03:37.720
Our training division manager, Darnisha Davis Collier

03:38.220 --> 03:42.372
my Executive assistant, Levanda Donohue senior

03:42.436 --> 03:45.764
Staff Analyst, Shelley Carter, who manages the energy Resilience

03:45.812 --> 03:49.864
and efficiency program and to my right, a Chief Financial

03:49.912 --> 03:53.692
Officer and Division Manager, Russell Lee, who will be assisting me in answering any

03:53.746 --> 03:57.224
financial questions regarding the fiscal year 23 proposed

03:57.272 --> 04:00.080
budget. Next slide.

04:02.020 --> 04:05.596
GSD operations are divided into four core programs

04:05.628 --> 04:09.244
of service one, property and environmental management

04:09.372 --> 04:13.140
two, design and construction and real estate services three

04:13.210 --> 04:16.432
security management and four, administrative,

04:16.496 --> 04:20.544
financial and energy management services with the primary goals

04:20.592 --> 04:24.260
of reducing costs and continuing to improve our level of customer

04:24.330 --> 04:27.604
service. Our current organizational structure

04:27.652 --> 04:30.728
shows our total operating budget for the General Fund to

04:30.734 --> 04:34.952
be just over $42.1 million with 154

04:35.006 --> 04:37.980
FTEs. Next slide.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.044
The project cost recovery fund has a proposed budget of

04:44.082 --> 04:47.256
$6.8 million with 51 FTEs.

04:47.448 --> 04:51.244
All expenses in this fund are charged back to the Capital Improvement

04:51.292 --> 04:54.924
Plan or CIP, Bond funds. The FTEs

04:54.972 --> 04:57.532
in this fund provide CIP planning,

04:57.676 --> 05:01.464
management, manage the design and construction facilities

05:01.532 --> 05:05.396
for all departments except the Houston Airport System, manage the

05:05.418 --> 05:09.056
CIP construction contracts, and facilitate tenant moves

05:09.088 --> 05:12.452
and improvements. By mid September this year,

05:12.506 --> 05:16.324
we will be complete with the A leaf neighborhood center and the maintenance

05:16.372 --> 05:20.232
and operational costs are included in our FY 2023

05:20.286 --> 05:23.080
proposed budget. Next slide.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.984
The Maintenance, Renewal and Replacement, or MRR

05:29.032 --> 05:32.700
fund has a proposed budget of $30.77

05:32.770 --> 05:35.180
million and 76 FTEs.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.328
This fund provides for the maintenance, repair and replacement of building

05:39.414 --> 05:42.220
systems and operational components for mechanical,

05:42.300 --> 05:46.208
electrical, plumbing, HVAC, life, safety, security,

05:46.294 --> 05:49.680
monitoring, structural and energy systems.

05:50.420 --> 05:54.404
Next, in our

05:54.442 --> 05:59.140
General Fund revenue budget, there's an increase of $29,000

05:59.210 --> 06:03.044
due to an escalations on rents that GSD collects and

06:03.082 --> 06:06.836
an increase of $19,000 due to an increase in planned

06:06.868 --> 06:10.344
projects that will be charged back to the Fleet Department and

06:10.382 --> 06:13.480
Parking Management. General Services will continue

06:13.550 --> 06:17.020
to charge back its personnel costs for operations of public works

06:17.090 --> 06:21.784
facilities. There is a decrease in miscellaneous revenue

06:21.832 --> 06:26.136
as we do not budget for possible recoveries and refunds.

06:26.328 --> 06:27.070
Next.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.610
Our General Fund revenue is budgeted at 3.9 million

06:34.980 --> 06:38.880
with changes as discussed in the previous slide. Our Project

06:38.950 --> 06:42.544
Recovery Fund revenue is budgeted at just under $6.8

06:42.582 --> 06:46.528
million, an increase of $1.6 million due

06:46.544 --> 06:49.780
to the hiring of additional project managers and support

06:49.850 --> 06:53.524
personnel. During fiscal year 22, our in

06:53.562 --> 06:57.304
house renovation group budget was decreased to zero due to this

06:57.342 --> 07:01.400
group being dissolved and FTEs being moved to the General Fund

07:01.470 --> 07:05.124
or MRR. Fund. Our MRR revenue

07:05.172 --> 07:08.828
is budgeted at $29.8 million, which is the same

07:08.914 --> 07:11.580
as the FY 22 adopted budget.

07:12.320 --> 07:16.088
The increase over fiscal year 21 is primarily due

07:16.104 --> 07:20.104
to finance reducing the revenue transferred into the Fund in

07:20.162 --> 07:23.472
FY 21 to assist with the FY 21

07:23.526 --> 07:26.480
budget deficit. Next slide.

07:28.820 --> 07:32.316
For FY 23, we are proposing an expenditure budget

07:32.348 --> 07:36.416
in our General Fund of $42.2 million. The restricted

07:36.448 --> 07:39.924
accounts include service chargeback accounts for items such as

07:39.962 --> 07:44.020
fuel, electricity, It accounts, et cetera.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.120
Next slide.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.876
The total proposed budget for all funds for fiscal

07:51.908 --> 07:55.610
year 2023 is $79.6 million.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.320
Next slide.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.028
In the General Fund, the $28.3 million

08:04.114 --> 08:07.996
nonpersonal costs make up roughly 67% of the

08:08.018 --> 08:11.384
General Fund budget. Restricted accounts represent

08:11.432 --> 08:14.872
roughly 38% of the total nonpersonal

08:14.936 --> 08:18.816
costs. The remaining nonpersonal budget is for services such

08:18.838 --> 08:22.012
as janitorial services, security management,

08:22.156 --> 08:26.580
sewer services, real estate rentals and landscaping.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.388
Next, the Project

08:30.474 --> 08:34.944
Cost Recovery Fund personnel costs make up 97%

08:35.002 --> 08:39.064
of the budget, with restricted accounts and miscellaneous services making

08:39.102 --> 08:40.890
up the remaining 3%.

08:41.580 --> 08:42.330
Next,

08:44.860 --> 08:49.100
in the MRR Fund, the $23.7 million

08:49.170 --> 08:53.116
in nonpersonal costs make up 77.2% of the

08:53.138 --> 08:56.780
budget. Of this, $21.2 million,

08:56.850 --> 09:00.316
or 89.6% is budgeted

09:00.348 --> 09:04.704
for services and $2.4 million, or 10.4%,

09:04.822 --> 09:06.640
is budgeted for supplies.

09:07.540 --> 09:11.424
Next. GSD's fiscal year

09:11.462 --> 09:15.284
22 adopted budget was $41.9 million.

09:15.482 --> 09:18.352
With the fiscal year 2022 budget adjustments,

09:18.416 --> 09:22.196
our projected current General Fund budget is

09:22.218 --> 09:25.812
now $41.6 million. In the General

09:25.866 --> 09:29.652
Fund, we are proposing an FY 2023 expenditure budget

09:29.716 --> 09:33.780
of $42.1 million. As noted on the exhibit,

09:33.860 --> 09:37.664
this includes the adjustments for the opening of the A Leaf Neighborhood

09:37.732 --> 09:41.340
Center and contractual and operational adjustments.

09:41.840 --> 09:42.590
Next,

09:44.640 --> 09:48.472
this graph shows the previous five years budgets compared

09:48.536 --> 09:51.400
to our proposed FY 23 budget.

09:51.560 --> 09:55.344
The increase in the budget from FY 22 to 23

09:55.462 --> 09:59.132
is due to the 3% Hope increase, as well as the additional

09:59.196 --> 10:02.456
budget for operational and maintenance of the new A Leaf

10:02.508 --> 10:06.548
Neighborhood Center. This concludes our presentations. Do you

10:06.554 --> 10:10.548
have any questions, sir? We sure do,

10:10.634 --> 10:14.500
and thanks for the presentation. We'll start off with council member Abby Cayman.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.610
Good morning, Director, and thank you again to you and your entire team.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.848
You all are often behind the scenes, but we can't get anything done if we

10:23.854 --> 10:27.192
don't have the structural integrity to do so.

10:27.246 --> 10:30.844
So thank you all. Director, three quick

10:30.882 --> 10:34.204
questions for you. One, can you provide a quick update to

10:34.242 --> 10:37.612
us? I know we're getting going

10:37.666 --> 10:41.364
on construction for the annex tunnel, things like that, but damages

10:41.432 --> 10:45.244
sustained during Harvey. Where are we in that recovery

10:45.292 --> 10:47.888
process for our buildings right now?

10:48.054 --> 10:51.696
And I'll speak first on City Hall and City Hall annex, which you

10:51.718 --> 10:56.192
see every day. And you've seen some significant improvement

10:56.256 --> 10:58.100
in the City Hall basement.

10:59.880 --> 11:03.536
So I'll start with the tunnel. So the tunnel, if you've

11:03.568 --> 11:07.308
noticed, on the Bagby Street side, there's a lot of digging and corriding

11:07.424 --> 11:11.780
to find the source of the water intrusion into the tunnel.

11:11.940 --> 11:15.704
Once we find that and the tunnel is sealed to

11:15.742 --> 11:19.228
keep the water from intruding, that part of the

11:19.314 --> 11:23.516
Harvey damage will start to be done at

11:23.618 --> 11:27.404
City Hall. We're waiting for a call today from

11:27.442 --> 11:31.260
the ceiling tile contractor, and we're keeping our fingers crossed.

11:31.420 --> 11:34.656
As with everything in the nation, COVID and

11:34.678 --> 11:38.028
the war in Ukraine has put a damper on receiving

11:38.124 --> 11:41.664
materials. We were initially told the ceiling tiles for

11:41.702 --> 11:45.152
the hallway and the mayor's conference room would be about

11:45.206 --> 11:47.830
a twelve to 16 week lead time.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.796
The contractor is waiting on a call. We believe we got that down to three

11:51.818 --> 11:55.280
or four weeks. If that is true, we will be complete

11:55.370 --> 11:58.440
with the basement by the end of June.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.656
Kindle library is another. It's on track to

12:03.678 --> 12:07.000
be finished sometime soon. So we're making

12:07.070 --> 12:11.544
progress. But, again, we did run into delays

12:11.672 --> 12:15.404
with COVID and then the war in Ukraine. No, and I bring that

12:15.442 --> 12:19.292
up especially for the purposes for public knowledge in terms

12:19.346 --> 12:22.376
of we're still working on everything from Harvey,

12:22.408 --> 12:25.472
and it's been slow with Ukraine. And I know you all are working as quickly

12:25.526 --> 12:28.560
as possible, but even on city properties,

12:29.300 --> 12:32.624
we're still dealing with addressing a lot of those challenges. Right.

12:32.662 --> 12:35.936
And we look at municipal courts. We are dealing

12:35.968 --> 12:40.052
with well, not our office, but Finance and Mr.

12:40.106 --> 12:43.600
Costello's group are dealing with FEMA for the funding

12:43.680 --> 12:47.352
to replace municipal courts. And it's five years

12:47.406 --> 12:49.930
later. Back in queue, please.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.740
So you're getting off easy. There are no other questions from council members,

12:56.810 --> 12:59.930
but I would like to state yeah, go ahead.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.210
No one else is in queue. Okay.

13:04.540 --> 13:06.970
Secondly director asking.

13:08.140 --> 13:11.480
I got two more questions. Second Director,

13:12.460 --> 13:15.816
you and your chief of staff and your entire staff,

13:15.848 --> 13:19.176
I know, worked really diligently when an issue came up. And I was hoping

13:19.208 --> 13:22.924
you could share with us the

13:22.962 --> 13:26.368
progress that has been made in terms of healthcare coverage for our security

13:26.454 --> 13:30.016
personnel and just all of the efforts that

13:30.118 --> 13:33.344
you and your team made to make sure that we're doing right

13:33.382 --> 13:36.864
by our security personnel. Sure. And if I can,

13:36.902 --> 13:39.972
I'll tell a little story on how this came about. So,

13:40.026 --> 13:44.164
Council Member Cayman, who talks to the security officers here

13:44.202 --> 13:47.844
on a daily basis, noticed the security officer with

13:47.882 --> 13:51.232
a limp, and they talked about going to see a doctor.

13:51.376 --> 13:54.824
And the security officer told them that she didn't have

13:54.942 --> 13:58.804
medical insurance because it was too high. So the council member contacted

13:58.852 --> 14:01.480
my office, and we looked into it,

14:01.630 --> 14:05.832
and we found a huge discrepancy with the contractor

14:05.896 --> 14:09.644
as far as meeting the requirements for payer play,

14:09.842 --> 14:13.976
and the contractor is good. They met with us, we discussed

14:14.008 --> 14:17.840
the discrepancy. And that was all started in December

14:18.260 --> 14:21.436
by I think it was end of February or March.

14:21.628 --> 14:25.244
We had 199 security officers

14:25.292 --> 14:28.564
on the contract working here at City Hall and

14:28.602 --> 14:33.236
City Hall Annex. Of that 199,

14:33.338 --> 14:36.804
only 33 of them were verified to have any

14:36.842 --> 14:40.600
type of insurance coverage. With the help of the insurance company

14:40.670 --> 14:43.000
and us getting them within compliance,

14:44.140 --> 14:47.784
they moved that up totally with their insurance or any other

14:47.822 --> 14:50.410
type of insurance, up to 162.

14:50.940 --> 14:55.020
So we thank you for bringing it to us, because it also

14:55.170 --> 14:59.272
discovered some discrepancies. We have not only GSD,

14:59.336 --> 15:02.744
but dealings with SPD and Oboe on maintaining

15:02.792 --> 15:06.384
the compliance of Pay or Play, which we're working with those

15:06.422 --> 15:09.840
other departments to make sure the contractors are within

15:09.910 --> 15:13.644
compliance. I appreciate that update.

15:13.772 --> 15:17.344
And again, I credit you and your team for

15:17.382 --> 15:20.804
all of the work that was done on that. I simply asked a question.

15:20.842 --> 15:24.068
But the credit lies with you all and bringing them up finally,

15:24.154 --> 15:27.552
Director, I'm asking every department, due to the financial

15:27.616 --> 15:30.936
constraints that not only Council is facing, but the city as

15:30.958 --> 15:34.744
a whole is facing, what are the needs that

15:34.782 --> 15:38.056
are not currently being met by this budget and what

15:38.078 --> 15:41.736
are the foreseeable needs in the near future. So what

15:41.758 --> 15:45.676
I've noticed in my now almost six years of

15:45.778 --> 15:48.952
sitting in this chair, and it's not just this administration,

15:49.016 --> 15:52.764
but it's past administrations that we talk

15:52.802 --> 15:56.764
about deferred maintenance, and where we are with deferred maintenance,

15:56.812 --> 16:00.464
and we're looking at a deferred maintenance bill of $594,000,000.

16:00.502 --> 16:04.256
And that's huge.

16:04.438 --> 16:07.768
And the only sector we can compare

16:07.804 --> 16:11.584
ourselves with is the private sector. And the private sector

16:11.632 --> 16:15.220
tells us the city should be given or putting X amount of money

16:15.290 --> 16:18.884
into capital improvement and X

16:18.922 --> 16:22.884
amount of millions of dollars into maintenance

16:22.932 --> 16:27.096
and operations. We receive less

16:27.118 --> 16:31.064
than half of what they say we should, but we

16:31.102 --> 16:35.260
do it what we can. But the funding

16:35.680 --> 16:38.984
is needed. Being a retired

16:39.032 --> 16:42.540
policeman, I tell Chief Fender I'm 100%,

16:42.610 --> 16:45.808
if you cut me, I still bleed blue. And I tell Chief Pina wait a

16:45.814 --> 16:51.730
minute, it'll turn red. And I understand those

16:52.420 --> 16:55.616
ladies and gentlemen, the job they do, not many people do

16:55.638 --> 16:59.364
it, and they deserve what you give them. But we can't forget about the

16:59.402 --> 17:01.350
facilities they have to work in.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.772
Our biggest fear this year with the, as I mentioned

17:06.826 --> 17:10.570
earlier about shipments being delayed is that we have

17:10.940 --> 17:13.080
HVAC systems that fail,

17:13.820 --> 17:17.620
that cannot be fixed and have to be replaced.

17:17.780 --> 17:21.464
And then there's an eight to twelve week lead

17:21.502 --> 17:24.904
time to get that equipment here. And then we have to rent

17:24.952 --> 17:28.696
temporary equipment. Well, what we found is when we rent that temporary

17:28.728 --> 17:32.444
equipment for three or four months, we could have bought two

17:32.482 --> 17:36.816
units that we're replacing. So that's what

17:36.918 --> 17:38.370
hamstrings us.

17:42.820 --> 17:46.556
Thank you. I neglected to welcome council

17:46.588 --> 17:50.784
member Mary NAN Hoffman, council member Robert Gallegos, and council member David

17:50.832 --> 17:54.004
Robinson. They are here at the Horseshoe. Next question comes from

17:54.042 --> 17:58.020
council member David Robinson and council member Tiffany D Thomas.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.828
Thank you, Council Member Robinson.

18:03.924 --> 18:07.176
Thank you Chair. Thank you all for your presentation. And I

18:07.198 --> 18:10.904
know the GSD is doing everything you can with

18:11.102 --> 18:15.176
the delays, director, as you mentioned, with the global supply chain,

18:15.368 --> 18:19.480
material shortages, construction schedules, cost inflation,

18:19.640 --> 18:23.112
and the list goes on. I guess there's a bit of a preview.

18:23.176 --> 18:26.624
I know coming up on a TTI committee meeting ahead is

18:26.742 --> 18:30.144
some review of our deferred maintenance on

18:30.182 --> 18:33.916
some of our facilities that are in your portfolio. So this is essentially

18:34.028 --> 18:38.084
extra budgetary question, but something that

18:38.122 --> 18:43.136
I'd like maybe some comment from you about the overall impact

18:43.248 --> 18:46.980
of the delay in the global supply

18:47.880 --> 18:51.336
set of conditions with what we've been

18:51.358 --> 18:55.656
able to do. How you've been able to prioritize the projects you have

18:55.838 --> 18:59.704
and what consequences we as a city may be suffering in

18:59.742 --> 19:03.544
terms of a delay on prioritized projects that you've

19:03.592 --> 19:07.928
had. Some of us have had in our hoped

19:07.944 --> 19:11.756
for list of priorities for your department and the city.

19:11.938 --> 19:16.012
So there was a time here at City Hall

19:16.156 --> 19:19.536
in the recent past where we had air handler units on

19:19.558 --> 19:23.376
the corner of Walker and Bagby because we had an

19:23.478 --> 19:25.920
air handler unit in the basement fail,

19:26.600 --> 19:30.310
and we were given some serious lead time

19:30.920 --> 19:33.652
and we have to think outside the box.

19:33.786 --> 19:37.236
Being former military, I tell my guys,

19:37.338 --> 19:40.468
just because a company says this,

19:40.634 --> 19:44.712
they're not the only people in the United States that make this

19:44.766 --> 19:47.976
stuff. We have to go elsewhere. We have to

19:47.998 --> 19:51.808
use whatever we can to speed the process up. We've been lucky

19:51.924 --> 19:55.996
so far that most of the lead times we've been given,

19:56.178 --> 20:00.188
we've been able to reduce by looking

20:00.274 --> 20:01.180
elsewhere.

20:03.840 --> 20:07.696
The impact to the city that this will

20:07.878 --> 20:11.488
have if we meet run into these

20:11.574 --> 20:15.104
long delays is we pay extra

20:15.222 --> 20:19.700
to keep a building cool or warm. That's going to be our biggest

20:20.440 --> 20:23.668
problem, is HVAC system

20:23.754 --> 20:27.076
failure. We had an FCA done, as you know,

20:27.098 --> 20:30.376
in 2012, which is outdated, and we have a

20:30.398 --> 20:34.264
current one that should be wrapped up hopefully next month.

20:34.382 --> 20:37.940
That's going to give us a new light on where our facilities

20:38.020 --> 20:38.650
stand.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.848
Unfortunately, it's not any better than it was in 2012.

20:43.934 --> 20:47.384
It's a lot worse. Let me say I appreciate

20:47.432 --> 20:51.176
that last comment, especially about HVAC and some of what our buildings

20:51.208 --> 20:55.024
need to do for an upgrade. It's also, in addition to the

20:55.062 --> 20:58.412
costliness of it for our budget, it's also incredibly

20:58.476 --> 21:02.144
expensive from an environmental standpoint. What we're doing to

21:02.182 --> 21:06.012
not upgrade our facilities is one of the biggest

21:06.076 --> 21:09.664
degrees in which we're falling short of some of our climate action

21:09.712 --> 21:12.916
goals and goals to align ourselves with the

21:12.938 --> 21:16.468
resilient. Houston. True. That's one reason why

21:16.554 --> 21:21.352
I went to the administration, asked to start

21:21.486 --> 21:25.284
an energy efficiency section in GSD,

21:25.332 --> 21:28.644
which is one person now, Shelley Carter, who's done an outstanding

21:28.692 --> 21:32.760
job with the I think you're aware of the CICO

21:32.920 --> 21:36.252
loan and the Seco project that we about to kick off,

21:36.306 --> 21:39.752
which is the low hanging fruit of Led lighting

21:39.816 --> 21:43.276
in five facilities to start.

21:43.378 --> 21:47.088
I'll say start to meet those requirements. Thank you,

21:47.094 --> 21:50.556
Chair, and I know we'll get an update of that at the upcoming TTI committee

21:50.588 --> 21:54.720
meeting. So thanks for the view. Thank you, Council Member Robert Gallegos.

21:56.580 --> 21:59.664
Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Director, for the presentation.

21:59.792 --> 22:03.076
I know I'm on my 9th year here on Council, and every year I

22:03.098 --> 22:06.340
do look at the demographic breakdown of the different

22:06.410 --> 22:10.076
departments. I'd like to give you kudos

22:10.128 --> 22:14.536
in regards to the breakdown here on employees in

22:14.558 --> 22:18.456
the department. It reflects our city. But I

22:18.478 --> 22:22.256
would also ask if you can give me a breakdown on the management

22:22.388 --> 22:25.596
of your department as well. I'd like to

22:25.618 --> 22:29.628
review that if at all possible. Okay. Thank you.

22:29.794 --> 22:31.500
Council Member Ed Pollard.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.836
Thank you, Chair, and good morning to everyone. Director, thank you for your

22:35.858 --> 22:39.410
presentation. Thank you to your entire team for all the work that you do.

22:39.780 --> 22:43.228
If you had to put a dollar amount, let's say we could use some ARPA

22:43.244 --> 22:47.090
dollars to go towards deferred maintenance and things that

22:48.200 --> 22:51.696
would dramatically improve the state of our buildings

22:51.728 --> 22:55.456
and maintenance, what would that dollar amount be? A reasonable

22:55.488 --> 22:59.220
number. You said dramatically improve.

23:00.060 --> 23:04.040
Yeah, to dramatically improve.

23:04.780 --> 23:07.770
I'll meet you halfway. 250,000,000.

23:11.690 --> 23:15.206
Thank you. Thank you. There are no

23:15.228 --> 23:19.660
other council members in queue. I have one comment and then a question.

23:20.270 --> 23:23.942
There is no department in the city of Houston that I interact

23:24.006 --> 23:27.478
with and probably many council members interact with on a daily basis.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.734
Your department is phenomenal. And I know a lot of this is under my

23:30.772 --> 23:34.174
friend Eric Alexander, but the

23:34.212 --> 23:38.078
janitors that we have that do the hard work day in and day out

23:38.164 --> 23:41.594
are always there with a smile and a can do spirit.

23:41.722 --> 23:45.346
I miss miss Anna. Can you get it back across the street? Because I

23:45.368 --> 23:48.578
love asking her about her dad and seeing how he's doing.

23:48.744 --> 23:52.498
And John just does a great job. And I remember

23:52.584 --> 23:55.654
when Neil was a security guard and we hired him

23:55.692 --> 23:59.458
at GSD. Neil was the most respectful is the most respectful.

23:59.554 --> 24:02.534
Yes, sir. No, sir, can do. Guy I've ever met.

24:02.732 --> 24:06.220
Positive spirit, works his butt off.

24:07.070 --> 24:10.314
He just exemplifies the employees that

24:10.352 --> 24:15.350
we have in the city of Houston. And there's

24:15.850 --> 24:19.098
a famous saying, fish rots from the head. So when there's a good head,

24:19.264 --> 24:22.974
the rest of the employees will do a good job. And it's because of the

24:23.012 --> 24:26.766
executive staff I'm looking at here. And thanks for

24:26.788 --> 24:29.040
doing everything and doing the hard work.

24:29.730 --> 24:33.122
Those people are a joy to be around. They make my life

24:33.176 --> 24:36.594
better today. It makes me realize how lucky that

24:36.632 --> 24:40.242
I am, personally. And just kudos to

24:40.296 --> 24:43.498
the people that you have in your area that do the tough

24:43.534 --> 24:47.302
jobs day in and day out. I know it's not a sexy job,

24:47.356 --> 24:50.806
but, God, they do fantastic work. So thanks for

24:50.828 --> 24:54.306
those folks. My question is wrapped around deferred maintenance.

24:54.418 --> 24:58.010
What is our deferred maintenance backlog? Now, I know we did that study

24:58.080 --> 25:02.540
a while back. What is the dollar amount? I know you gave a $250,000,000.

25:03.710 --> 25:07.342
Say that again. 594,000,000. Say that again.

25:07.476 --> 25:10.526
594,000,000.

25:10.708 --> 25:14.542
It will increase. The estimate is in

25:14.596 --> 25:18.046
2024. It'll stay pretty flat for next year

25:18.068 --> 25:21.674
or two, but 2024, it will go up to 600

25:21.732 --> 25:25.342
million plus. So when you look at deferred maintenance,

25:25.406 --> 25:28.274
that's a lot of money to put into it. Seems like every day we have

25:28.312 --> 25:33.282
people working on our elevators. But think

25:33.336 --> 25:36.902
big or go home. And I look at the land

25:36.956 --> 25:41.270
that we have that isn't in much use next door to us. Tranquility park.

25:41.930 --> 25:45.434
Is it a good park? Yeah, it's okay. It's not one of the better

25:45.472 --> 25:49.740
ones. I'd love to see us build a new facility over there. Blow up.

25:50.510 --> 25:53.786
Lanier, the building. That's a horrible building.

25:53.968 --> 25:57.530
Horrible this building has its issues,

25:57.600 --> 26:01.514
but it's an art deco building and it probably has a great historical

26:01.562 --> 26:05.070
meaning to it. But the police building now, the horrible building.

26:05.140 --> 26:07.920
I know we looked at something. The old exxon building.

26:08.690 --> 26:11.380
God, this is probably five, six years ago.

26:12.310 --> 26:15.822
Can the record reflect that the chair has appreciated historical

26:15.886 --> 26:19.054
architecture? I'd like to let the chair

26:19.102 --> 26:21.858
reflect that from my architect friend. Thank you.

26:22.024 --> 26:25.846
Richard will appreciate that. But don't you think we need to one

26:25.868 --> 26:29.094
day look at a long term plan and begin that

26:29.132 --> 26:32.438
so we get away from this deferred maintenance and do something with building

26:32.524 --> 26:36.106
a new facility, maybe do a three P. We've had a lot of

26:36.128 --> 26:39.462
conversations wrapped around that. Just your thoughts.

26:39.606 --> 26:43.130
You've been around for many years. There is a plan or

26:43.200 --> 26:47.274
there has been talk to Renovate 611

26:47.322 --> 26:52.222
Walker to do something to do

26:52.276 --> 26:56.350
something different at Tranquility Park. So there is a plan.

26:56.420 --> 26:59.562
It's in the rough stages, but there's talk about

26:59.636 --> 27:02.786
doing exactly that. So do you think

27:02.808 --> 27:06.466
it's an optimistic plan or a realistic or a

27:06.488 --> 27:09.700
pessimistic? No one else is in queue, so I'm going to

27:10.630 --> 27:14.614
do you think we'll get it done because our

27:14.652 --> 27:18.854
deferred maintenance gets bigger and bigger and bigger. That's a tough one because

27:18.972 --> 27:21.618
the deferred maintenance is going to keep climbing,

27:21.714 --> 27:25.386
unfortunately, and the prices are going to keep going up.

27:25.488 --> 27:28.746
So I would

27:28.768 --> 27:32.330
be on the pessimistic side. Pessimistic. Okay, well,

27:32.480 --> 27:36.214
we'll go to public speakers, but I always sort of kid mayor Turner,

27:36.262 --> 27:39.566
I said we have a year and a half. What is your

27:39.588 --> 27:43.214
legacy? Complete communities, things like that. I'd love to see

27:43.252 --> 27:46.702
the Sylvester turn of building right across the street from us,

27:46.756 --> 27:50.074
housing a lot of people that need a new place to be housed.

27:50.122 --> 27:53.730
So I'll keep after them as long as you keep after them. Okay.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.506
Because I think there is a plan. Council member Gallegos thank you,

27:57.528 --> 28:00.926
chair. Actually, there is a master plan for Tranquility Park

28:00.958 --> 28:04.370
at the parks department. Unfortunately, there's no monies

28:04.530 --> 28:08.214
for this master plan. But that was something that I had

28:08.252 --> 28:12.130
seen way back when former director

28:12.210 --> 28:16.466
Turner was the parks director. And it's

28:16.498 --> 28:20.246
a really nice plan. Unfortunately, there's no monies.

28:20.358 --> 28:24.230
But I do agree with you in regards to the fountains as they're at Tranquility

28:24.310 --> 28:27.920
Park, I understand we're going to be trying to repair those once again,

28:28.690 --> 28:31.834
but in my opinion,

28:31.882 --> 28:35.146
I think that's just a lot of money being wasted because they've tried fixing

28:35.178 --> 28:38.270
that several times and they just keep breaking.

28:38.690 --> 28:42.580
So hopefully we can come up with the master plan or something

28:42.950 --> 28:46.274
that will save the city money instead of using it to repair something

28:46.312 --> 28:49.950
that constantly keeps breaking. Thank you. Thank you, council member.

28:50.110 --> 28:54.130
So before we go to public speakers, yesterday, we let public speaking

28:54.200 --> 28:57.426
get a little bit away from us. We'd like all the questions to be directed

28:57.458 --> 29:00.566
to council members. We'll do the best to try and answer them if we need

29:00.588 --> 29:03.350
some input from staff, we'll do that.

29:03.420 --> 29:06.714
But we want the directors to be

29:06.752 --> 29:10.374
focused on council members and public speakers to be focused

29:10.422 --> 29:13.402
on us as well. So with that being said,

29:13.456 --> 29:16.730
I will ask you to exit stage Bright

29:17.070 --> 29:20.106
and we will call on our first public speaker and

29:20.128 --> 29:24.058
that is Sabah Blanding.

29:24.234 --> 29:28.014
And if I can add one thing, GSD, we are looking

29:28.132 --> 29:31.506
outside of the box for funding. We're actually

29:31.608 --> 29:35.410
meeting with Bill Kelly and his staff to see if we can tap into

29:35.480 --> 29:39.650
some of the biden infrastructure bill funding

29:39.990 --> 29:43.400
towards energy efficiency. Just wanted to leave that.

29:45.210 --> 29:48.646
Thank you. And Ms. Blanding, direct the questions to us and

29:48.668 --> 29:52.518
we will field the questions from here. Okay. Good morning.

29:52.604 --> 29:56.466
My name is Saba Blanding. I'm a resident of District

29:56.498 --> 30:00.554
I, so council member Gallegos's district. My question is

30:00.752 --> 30:03.974
what environmental services and asbestos,

30:04.102 --> 30:07.934
lead, mold, soil remediation are you

30:07.972 --> 30:11.626
able to accomplish on your current budget? 17 million seems fairly

30:11.658 --> 30:15.466
low for such an essential safety work for property and environmental

30:15.498 --> 30:19.578
management. What are the comprehensive needs of the city of Houston?

30:19.674 --> 30:23.454
What resources would this department need to expand

30:23.502 --> 30:26.180
to address the full needs of the city?

30:26.870 --> 30:30.402
And what are efforts to make sure these services are addressed equitably across

30:30.456 --> 30:34.446
the city of Houston? We just talked about deferred

30:34.478 --> 30:37.982
maintenance a minute ago. You heard it

30:38.136 --> 30:41.958
heavy. Bill on deferred maintenance. Keeping a building like this

30:42.044 --> 30:46.234
up to speed with environmental friendly issues is really

30:46.272 --> 30:50.074
a tough task. I think the direction that

30:50.112 --> 30:54.202
we should head would be to build a lead

30:54.336 --> 30:57.674
platinum type facility that has all the things

30:57.712 --> 31:01.214
that you would want from an environmental standpoint and then

31:01.252 --> 31:05.086
house various departments. We tried to do that a couple of years ago when

31:05.108 --> 31:08.506
we were in negotiations with the folks who owned

31:08.538 --> 31:11.746
the old Exxon building down the street. But we

31:11.768 --> 31:15.458
had a number of issues with it because of the access

31:15.544 --> 31:18.610
to it underground and having the tunnel system work.

31:18.680 --> 31:22.706
But we don't do a very good job with the

31:22.728 --> 31:26.166
environmental side because of the age of the buildings and the condition of the

31:26.188 --> 31:29.926
buildings. But we should do better. And I think that will come

31:30.108 --> 31:33.858
with our ability to possibly do what council

31:33.874 --> 31:37.674
member Gallegos was talking about and that is to do a

31:37.712 --> 31:41.466
new development that will house various departments within the city.

31:41.648 --> 31:45.174
I don't know if any other council members have any. I'll defer

31:45.222 --> 31:48.854
to my Black Cape architect,

31:48.902 --> 31:52.318
David Robinson, who's in queue right now. Well,

31:52.404 --> 31:56.094
I think you're right. I think there's just lots to be done with

31:56.212 --> 31:59.914
our existing facilities, which is why I wanted to mention to the director

31:59.962 --> 32:03.406
some of those important aspects of deferred maintenance. But I

32:03.428 --> 32:06.994
think this Blanding raises an important point, not only for the

32:07.032 --> 32:10.494
issues already discussed with the cost of the mechanical

32:10.542 --> 32:13.762
systems, the upgrade and the cost of the environment,

32:13.826 --> 32:18.018
but also just the health impacts of all the users.

32:18.114 --> 32:21.766
So those are concerns that layer into

32:21.948 --> 32:26.374
how I believe we should prioritize the facilities and think

32:26.412 --> 32:29.786
about that carefully before we embark on any new programs and

32:29.888 --> 32:33.622
new construction. But I share your feeling, Chair, about Tranquility

32:33.686 --> 32:37.226
Park, and I know there are some plans that are coming forward. I believe the

32:37.248 --> 32:40.542
mayor's got a few on his desk that he's considering about that right now.

32:40.596 --> 32:43.774
That's great. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Blinding. Next was

32:43.812 --> 32:47.200
Jason Oliver. I don't see Jason today, so we're missing him.

32:47.570 --> 32:51.700
What's that? He's running a little late. He's running late. That's all right.

32:52.390 --> 32:53.810
Lauren Johnson.

32:56.970 --> 33:00.806
Good morning, Ms. Johnson. Hi. Good morning. My name is

33:00.828 --> 33:04.938
Lauren Johnson, and I wanted to ask which specific entities are

33:05.024 --> 33:09.526
receiving the $29 million from the Chapter 380 agreement

33:09.718 --> 33:13.866
and how much each of them are receiving and how

33:13.888 --> 33:17.440
do those get approved? Is it city council that approves those?

33:18.290 --> 33:21.950
Yes, it runs through the Office of Economic Development.

33:22.530 --> 33:26.394
380 agreements are reimbursements for infrastructure

33:26.442 --> 33:30.334
work that the City of Houston does not is

33:30.372 --> 33:34.034
not responsible for within certain developments. And that 380 goes

33:34.072 --> 33:37.634
back towards paying those developments for infrastructure work that should have been taken

33:37.672 --> 33:41.140
on by the City of Houston. I'm sorry.

33:42.390 --> 33:46.326
Go ahead and

33:46.348 --> 33:49.894
debt service. So, like yesterday, we went through our Houston Public Works

33:50.092 --> 33:53.414
presentation. And in that presentation, you can see there's a dotted line

33:53.452 --> 33:56.746
around 380 that also goes back to paying our debt. So our

33:56.768 --> 34:00.394
pay as you go programs and all of our infrastructure programs. So those are all

34:00.432 --> 34:04.682
reimbursements. Correct. Okay. Correct. And many times

34:04.816 --> 34:08.182
the developers don't get to a point where we reimburse them a penny.

34:08.246 --> 34:11.758
And we have many developers like that, but we reimburse them over a period of

34:11.764 --> 34:14.974
time instead of taking the work at that

34:15.012 --> 34:17.622
point in time and spending the monies upfront.

34:17.786 --> 34:21.730
So it's actually a pretty good program that works to our advantage.

34:22.230 --> 34:25.554
Any other council member questions, answers on that? Okay,

34:25.672 --> 34:29.246
thank you. Ms. Johnson. Ms.

34:29.278 --> 34:31.480
Jill Grochell. Good to see you again this morning.

34:33.530 --> 34:37.480
Appreciate you all being here again. On second day, actually, third day.

34:40.920 --> 34:44.296
Thank you for the welcome back. Yes, ma'am. Good morning to you all. I will

34:44.318 --> 34:49.384
say I'm a little disappointed that you

34:49.422 --> 34:52.616
asked the people that gave the budget to

34:52.638 --> 34:55.896
walk out yesterday. It was great to be able to speak with

34:55.918 --> 34:59.176
them and let them know how much

34:59.198 --> 35:02.640
we like what they do, and we're proud of what they do. And so I'm

35:02.660 --> 35:06.204
sad to see them leave. Yesterday, we heard

35:06.242 --> 35:10.460
a community group speak about the needs to address the exposed drainage impacting

35:10.540 --> 35:13.388
their community in the north side of Houston,

35:13.564 --> 35:17.212
the northeast side of Houston. Excuse me. They were directed.

35:17.276 --> 35:20.976
That might be a CIP issue. What can

35:20.998 --> 35:25.380
we do to prioritize these important projects within that department?

35:25.800 --> 35:30.004
Thank you for the question. Council member Abby Cayman. Just as

35:30.042 --> 35:33.604
some background, I know I can only speak to our committee, but we

35:33.642 --> 35:37.032
had been asked as standard procedure for all.

35:37.086 --> 35:40.472
Committees when the directors, after they present,

35:40.606 --> 35:44.116
sometimes public comment, can go on for an extended

35:44.148 --> 35:47.864
period of time and they all need to go back to work.

35:47.982 --> 35:51.676
So I appreciate what you're saying, I just also want to

35:51.698 --> 35:55.052
provide context that it's more so the general rule for

35:55.106 --> 35:58.700
all committees, it's not the exception during the budgetary process.

35:58.770 --> 36:02.236
Understood. So to answer your question, CIP is

36:02.258 --> 36:06.048
a roll in three year process. So every project

36:06.134 --> 36:09.996
we had in fiscal year 22 should be completed

36:10.028 --> 36:14.096
and rolls off. Generally not the case because we have more projects than available

36:14.198 --> 36:17.904
funding. And then 23 rolls on and then we add on the backside,

36:17.952 --> 36:21.716
it'd be fiscal year 27. So we

36:21.738 --> 36:25.396
go fiscal year 23 to 27. So then when we finish the ones on

36:25.418 --> 36:28.968
23, they roll off and we add 28 on board.

36:29.134 --> 36:32.856
So the tough thing about that is that many of us are

36:32.878 --> 36:36.184
on here for just another year and a half and we won't see

36:36.302 --> 36:39.656
the work of our office staff.

36:39.688 --> 36:43.052
And what we did in the CIP, that's going to come up long

36:43.106 --> 36:45.848
after we are here or we disappear.

36:46.024 --> 36:49.884
So it seems to work, but the problem we always have

36:49.922 --> 36:54.052
is it's underfunded and we never do all of the projects.

36:54.216 --> 36:57.488
That was one of the reasons why about six years ago we put in the

36:57.494 --> 37:01.168
council district service fund. So each of us have an allocation of dollars

37:01.254 --> 37:05.504
that we can use towards projects that we think are emergency type projects.

37:05.632 --> 37:09.012
And we all do a really good job of identifying the projects within

37:09.066 --> 37:12.704
our area. We firmly believe nobody knows our district

37:12.752 --> 37:16.340
better than ourselves because we're in them every day.

37:16.490 --> 37:19.928
And I include the at larges as well. I know I joke around a

37:19.934 --> 37:23.400
lot, a little bit tough on you, but you all are always present

37:23.470 --> 37:26.920
at our meetings and always concerned about our area.

37:26.990 --> 37:30.716
But CIP is a tough one because it's underfunded and

37:30.738 --> 37:33.964
we have too many needs and wants to really fully fund it.

37:34.002 --> 37:37.176
But working through council district service funds.

37:37.208 --> 37:40.364
And now with the SWAT program, we have extra millions

37:40.412 --> 37:43.852
going in that and maybe we'll have a different allocation

37:43.916 --> 37:48.048
when we look towards I believe if this budget is based on

37:48.214 --> 37:51.628
no increase on sales tax revenue,

37:51.804 --> 37:55.444
I think we're going to have a significant increase in sales tax revenue because

37:55.482 --> 37:58.900
it's predicated upon the price of goods today. And everybody

37:58.970 --> 38:02.624
who's been in a grocery store or bought anything knows that the price continues

38:02.672 --> 38:06.756
to go up. Thus, unfortunately, our sales tax revenue goes up.

38:06.858 --> 38:10.104
So I think we'll have the ability to create more in fund balance and maybe

38:10.142 --> 38:13.816
use some of that fund balance for exactly what we talked about. Just real

38:13.838 --> 38:17.192
quick, do you believe that the Northeast project

38:17.246 --> 38:21.288
is an emergency? Could that go into the emergency bucket?

38:21.384 --> 38:25.036
So I'll leave that up to council member Jackson to decide what's an emergency in

38:25.058 --> 38:28.620
her area not. But I live in Kingwood and

38:28.690 --> 38:32.176
I've been in District B more times than I've been anywhere because it's near my

38:32.198 --> 38:37.056
house. I go up there quite often. But I

38:37.078 --> 38:40.716
looked at those photos again this morning. It was concerning.

38:40.908 --> 38:44.720
But then again, my area lost 5000 homes

38:44.800 --> 38:47.952
and 500 businesses due to flooding.

38:48.016 --> 38:51.524
And we're trying to make sure that when the next hurricane comes,

38:51.722 --> 38:54.864
we don't get caught in that floodwater again. So we all have those

38:54.922 --> 38:58.084
fears. I'm sure that Council Member Amy Peck

38:58.132 --> 39:02.276
will say the same thing about her district, but Council Member

39:02.388 --> 39:05.928
Abby Cayman, especially Myerland and what we've had to

39:05.934 --> 39:09.576
do there. When you live at or

39:09.678 --> 39:13.896
just a little bit above sea level, you're going to have those types of situations

39:13.928 --> 39:17.516
pop up. And I don't care what you call it, whether you

39:17.538 --> 39:21.508
call it global change or global warming, the tornadoes

39:21.544 --> 39:26.076
are coming more rapidly and the hurricanes have more force to them. So we'll

39:26.108 --> 39:30.284
see. Council member Tiffany Thomas. Thank you. And thank you for participating

39:30.332 --> 39:33.990
in public comments. Really helpful feedback, but just something to consider.

39:34.760 --> 39:38.628
Imagine who we could be as a city if we actually receive flooding dollars from

39:38.634 --> 39:42.436
the Glo, right? Imagine the projects that have

39:42.458 --> 39:45.760
been in queue for cycles that are scheduled but not funded.

39:45.920 --> 39:49.640
Imagine who we could be if the federal infrastructure funds were

39:49.710 --> 39:53.450
a direct allocation to the city versus an application process.

39:53.900 --> 39:57.956
Because if it had not been for Hurricane Harvey in this region, those dollars wouldn't

39:57.988 --> 40:01.372
be available. Right? And so we are missing out on that.

40:01.426 --> 40:05.192
And then working through the federal process to schedule

40:05.256 --> 40:08.344
priority projects in any neighborhood. They're all priority.

40:08.392 --> 40:11.864
Right? Let me say, I am one of those people that I lost

40:11.912 --> 40:15.932
my home during Harvey and so I get it. But I also know how privileged

40:15.996 --> 40:19.776
I am and that we were okay. And I believe that there

40:19.798 --> 40:22.844
were many others that weren't. And that's where my heart goes.

40:22.902 --> 40:26.640
Sure. But here's my point is that we are limited

40:26.720 --> 40:29.956
while also being constrained. We're constrained because we

40:29.978 --> 40:32.870
don't have the support, the funding from the state.

40:33.320 --> 40:37.028
We're working through the process federally. And so what we have as a

40:37.114 --> 40:41.096
local city, we're doing the very best and it's not as fast as we

40:41.118 --> 40:44.676
would like. I have at least five unscheduled funded

40:44.708 --> 40:47.784
projects that have been on the books for a while. So I mean, you're absolutely

40:47.902 --> 40:52.456
correct. But just for the public that's listening. The larger

40:52.648 --> 40:56.508
issue is that Houston has been missing out and we have a serious issue

40:56.594 --> 41:00.124
around flooding and infrastructure because it's not a matter of if

41:00.162 --> 41:03.772
another storm will come, it's when. And it could rain for 30 minutes

41:03.826 --> 41:07.056
in the city and you have two inches of water in your drain, like those

41:07.078 --> 41:10.544
storms are that intense. And so we are trying to keep up with that.

41:10.582 --> 41:14.304
And then also look at the plans that were designed pre

41:14.342 --> 41:17.680
Harvey or right after Harvey. Now looking at our new resiliency

41:17.760 --> 41:21.156
standards. Now looking at the new data and city modeling and

41:21.178 --> 41:23.988
what does it take in terms of drainage. So there's some work we have to

41:23.994 --> 41:27.396
do to make sure that those plans meet those standards, because we

41:27.418 --> 41:30.776
don't want to offer your neighborhood or any neighborhood a project just to

41:30.798 --> 41:33.416
say we did a project. We want to make sure that when we come in

41:33.438 --> 41:37.236
and offer a project that you feel safe knowing that those drains work, those streets

41:37.268 --> 41:40.412
will clear and that you won't be in a danger of losing your home.

41:40.466 --> 41:43.864
And so we have to continue this process of raising

41:43.912 --> 41:47.356
this issue. And thank you for bringing that

41:47.378 --> 41:50.796
information to us and keeping it on our radar. It's very helpful. Thank you.

41:50.818 --> 41:53.936
Council member Tasha Jackson. Thank you,

41:53.958 --> 41:57.568
Mayor Pro TEM, and thank you, Council Member Thomas for that.

41:57.734 --> 42:01.068
Also, as Council Member Thomas said, we have SWAT projects,

42:01.084 --> 42:04.530
but then also we have to think about the revenue cap.

42:04.980 --> 42:09.332
I'm hearing throughout the whole from yesterday, the issue is money.

42:09.466 --> 42:12.276
Where are we getting the money? And what we're talking about right now is the

42:12.298 --> 42:15.876
revenue that the city have, but there is revenue that we could have that

42:15.898 --> 42:19.976
we don't have because of a revenue cap. And so two

42:19.998 --> 42:23.864
caps. Yeah. Even if we just had gotten rid of the city

42:23.902 --> 42:27.204
cap, we would have more resources to do a lot of these projects.

42:27.252 --> 42:31.256
So the flood mitigation projects, we have 14 projects on the

42:31.278 --> 42:35.032
book for District B and working with Harris County

42:35.096 --> 42:38.364
Flood Control to kind of mitigate some of these projects. So projects are moving forward.

42:38.402 --> 42:42.304
It's not moving fast enough. We have some projects on the books from

42:42.422 --> 42:46.236
2011. These are capital improvement projects.

42:46.268 --> 42:49.584
So just know that we need dollars, and the

42:49.622 --> 42:53.532
dollars is out there, but we just need to identify

42:53.596 --> 42:57.316
ways to get it. And removing that revenue cap is one

42:57.338 --> 43:00.932
of the ways that we can get some dollars to do projects that we definitely

43:00.986 --> 43:04.676
need within our neighborhood. So thank you. Thank you for participating, and thanks

43:04.698 --> 43:08.152
again, Ms. Grochell. You're welcome. I see Mr.

43:08.206 --> 43:11.336
Oliver showed up, so if you present your tardy slip to

43:11.358 --> 43:15.080
the principal, we'll allow you. You have your 1 minute.

43:15.500 --> 43:16.890
Good to see you again.

43:20.720 --> 43:24.430
Good morning. Yeah, still morning. Okay.

43:25.120 --> 43:28.750
Been here for a while, so good morning, everyone.

43:30.900 --> 43:34.624
Let's see. So I just came in and I

43:34.662 --> 43:38.064
talked about this a bit yesterday, but I think it falls specifically under

43:38.102 --> 43:41.472
General Services. So the security right.

43:41.526 --> 43:44.844
I tried to use my Harris County enhanced library

43:44.892 --> 43:48.244
card ID to get in, and they told me that I needed either

43:48.282 --> 43:52.036
a state ID or driver's license or passport to get in.

43:52.138 --> 43:56.288
Again, this is something we live in Houston. We have quite a

43:56.314 --> 43:59.576
few people who may not have those forms of ID.

43:59.758 --> 44:03.892
So thinking about who is able to come in here and provide public comment,

44:03.956 --> 44:07.508
somebody behind me yesterday had forgotten his license

44:07.604 --> 44:11.128
and was having trouble getting in a staffer once a Council

44:11.144 --> 44:17.292
Member Jackson staffers had to come down and vouch for him. Right. So we

44:17.346 --> 44:21.090
really need to kind of make sure that this is more accessible in that way.

44:22.340 --> 44:26.140
I forgot my other thing. Capital improvement projects.

44:26.220 --> 44:29.472
I just think translation is a big deal,

44:29.526 --> 44:33.932
especially for city documents, thinking about how can we improve the infrastructure

44:34.076 --> 44:37.456
on budgetary documents and then capital improvement documents,

44:37.568 --> 44:41.108
because these affect the entire city. So I just want to make sure and kind

44:41.114 --> 44:44.500
of urge that as well. Sure. Council member Robert Gallegos.

44:45.080 --> 44:48.280
Thank you, Chair. Thank you for that explanation.

44:48.620 --> 44:52.724
When you were saying that you tried to get in with the new Harris County

44:52.852 --> 44:56.276
ID, they didn't accept it. No, I tried it yesterday

44:56.388 --> 45:00.060
on the first floor and then today in the basement.

45:00.560 --> 45:04.876
I'm glad you brought that to my attention because I've met with Mayor Turner to

45:04.898 --> 45:08.316
see if we will accept the new

45:08.338 --> 45:11.776
Harris County ID. And I think that would be a

45:11.798 --> 45:14.000
great, great asset, hopefully.

45:15.220 --> 45:18.400
Can you tell me if that ID has a chip on it?

45:18.550 --> 45:21.456
I don't think it has a chip. Yeah,

45:21.638 --> 45:24.660
it just has the card and then photo

45:25.320 --> 45:28.964
address and then gender and right.

45:29.002 --> 45:32.644
Because I know the sheriff's department accepts it. I know Mayor Turner is looking

45:32.682 --> 45:36.820
at HPD to see if HPD will accept it. And I'm hoping

45:36.900 --> 45:40.068
that this is something that can be used for metro,

45:40.244 --> 45:43.240
something that can be used for the B cycle stations.

45:44.380 --> 45:47.988
Basically a universal Harris County ID that Harris

45:48.004 --> 45:51.116
County residents can use. So thank you for bringing that to

45:51.138 --> 45:54.524
my attention. I'm hoping the mayor's administration is

45:54.562 --> 45:58.568
listening to this as well. Thank you. Thank you. Council Member Abby Cayman

45:58.664 --> 46:03.084
I also wanted to echo my appreciation for flagging the issue and Council Member Gallegos

46:03.132 --> 46:07.824
for the update and taking the charge, especially given

46:07.942 --> 46:12.400
the implementation of the state's photo ID laws,

46:12.840 --> 46:16.164
the additional hurdles that go into place right. That make

46:16.202 --> 46:20.212
it that much harder for an average person to get that state

46:20.266 --> 46:23.924
issued driver's license or photo ID will be

46:23.962 --> 46:27.524
critical to make sure that we're being as inclusive as possible within the parameters

46:27.572 --> 46:30.664
of security and safety that we have to provide at the city.

46:30.782 --> 46:34.660
Right. Thank you. Council member Robert Gallegos.

46:34.820 --> 46:38.548
Thank you, council Member Kayman. Yes. This is an ID that I think can be

46:38.574 --> 46:42.430
used for homeless individuals that need an ID

46:42.800 --> 46:46.316
for individuals that are coming out of jail that don't have

46:46.338 --> 46:49.884
an ID. So that way, hopefully, they can find a job and what have you.

46:49.922 --> 46:53.216
So this is something that I'm hoping we

46:53.238 --> 46:56.924
can work with the Harris County and have it as a universal

46:56.972 --> 47:00.656
ID for Harris County residents or who lose them in floods that

47:00.678 --> 47:04.032
are so rare in Houston and Harris County. Right,

47:04.086 --> 47:07.708
right. Thank you, Ronnie. On that note,

47:07.804 --> 47:11.596
this concludes our General Service Department budget

47:11.628 --> 47:15.812
workshop. We will now transition to to Parks and Recreation.

47:15.876 --> 47:19.976
I see those folks are here so we'll allow a

47:19.998 --> 47:22.920
couple of minute transition and we'll get right into it a little bit early,

47:22.990 --> 47:25.000
which we couldn't say at all yesterday.
