WEBVTT

00:00.730 --> 00:04.030
Okay, so now we move into your budget presentation.

00:25.450 --> 00:27.720
You thank you.

00:29.610 --> 00:33.254
I'll be quick. So this is the budget presentations for

00:33.292 --> 00:37.254
Finance Department. You should

00:37.292 --> 00:39.320
have a handout in front of you.

00:41.930 --> 00:48.246
Before I begin the first slide, please let

00:48.268 --> 00:51.706
me quickly introduce the key players in the Finance Department. I know you've

00:51.738 --> 00:54.862
met William Jones. You may already

00:54.916 --> 00:58.414
interacted with some of these excellent team players in

00:58.452 --> 01:01.390
this Finance Department supporting me in leading this department.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.570
I just want to make sure we have the slides.

01:07.590 --> 01:10.866
Okay, well, while we're waiting on

01:10.888 --> 01:14.706
that, I know you have your handout. That will be slide two. In your

01:14.728 --> 01:18.254
handout, we have six divisions in the Finance

01:18.302 --> 01:21.818
departments. Again. From the director's office, we have Bernita

01:21.854 --> 01:25.254
Jones. I don't know if she's here. If not,

01:25.372 --> 01:28.566
so if I call your name, please do stand up so that I don't have

01:28.588 --> 01:31.846
to look back. So we have Fernita Jones,

01:31.878 --> 01:35.130
who of course you all met and very familiar who support

01:35.200 --> 01:38.662
the Council's Office. We have Rochelle McHenry.

01:38.806 --> 01:42.298
Anushi is here. Thanks Rochelle. She supported

01:42.314 --> 01:45.786
the Houston fire departments. We also have William Bryan,

01:45.818 --> 01:48.814
who support the Houston Information Technology. Thank you,

01:48.852 --> 01:52.490
William. We have Sheila Murphy, who also supported

01:52.570 --> 01:55.360
the business office in the finance department. Thank you.

01:56.610 --> 02:00.926
The next division is Treasury Capital Management. Of course, you all know Melissa Dubovsky,

02:00.958 --> 02:04.366
who's not here today. We also have financial planning

02:04.398 --> 02:07.640
analysis. William Jones, who you've met.

02:08.810 --> 02:12.374
The next one is the financial reporting and operations by

02:12.412 --> 02:15.686
Are sheet. Just want to make sure you know the

02:15.708 --> 02:19.346
face and the name together. And, of course, we have the strategic

02:19.378 --> 02:21.930
procurement divisions. Jerry Adams.

02:22.990 --> 02:26.426
There you go. Our chief procurement officer. And last but

02:26.448 --> 02:30.226
not least is the Performance improvement, Jesse Bounds. If he's

02:30.278 --> 02:33.566
here, the computer froze in the back.

02:33.588 --> 02:37.182
So just keep working. Okay, so again, Finance Departments has

02:37.236 --> 02:40.926
two funds. So we have the general fund

02:41.028 --> 02:44.500
for Citywide Surfaces as well as the revolving fund,

02:46.790 --> 02:49.986
which is a surface chargeback for financial services provided to

02:50.008 --> 02:53.666
certain departments. So with that, we are moving to the

02:53.688 --> 02:57.186
next slide. Slide number three, if you can, flip your

02:57.208 --> 03:00.626
page again on the Functional Organization charts chart.

03:00.658 --> 03:05.160
In the general fund, the finance budget is at 20.8 million

03:05.530 --> 03:09.162
with 116 FTEs in this. So again,

03:09.216 --> 03:12.458
you saw the functional indirector's office from the

03:12.464 --> 03:16.326
Council Administration's, legislative Analysis,

03:16.518 --> 03:20.290
TPIA Coordinations, the Treasury Capital

03:20.390 --> 03:23.934
Management at 2.9 million. This is the

03:23.972 --> 03:27.034
area that handles the capital budget, planning,

03:27.082 --> 03:31.210
management, reporting and Analysis, the debt issuance and Derivative

03:31.290 --> 03:35.022
monitoring, economic Modeling and Projection,

03:35.086 --> 03:37.330
the City's financial alternative,

03:38.470 --> 03:42.398
liquidity alternatives, tax and Revenues Management.

03:42.494 --> 03:45.718
I know Melissa often would come before councils to

03:45.724 --> 03:49.110
give a presentation on upcoming financial transactions.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.754
That division also handles the OPEP and pension

03:52.802 --> 03:56.562
system analysis, financial planning analysis.

03:56.706 --> 04:00.106
Budget at 2.5 million. Again, this is FTEs at

04:00.128 --> 04:03.850
16. But as you saw, we have very limited

04:05.550 --> 04:08.986
active employees at this point. Again,

04:09.088 --> 04:13.242
that division handling the citywide annual operating budget, the five year forecast,

04:13.306 --> 04:16.746
providing revenues and expenditures projections. We have the monthly

04:16.778 --> 04:19.930
financial reporting, mid year review, funds management

04:20.010 --> 04:23.074
and any ad hoc financial reporting the next

04:23.112 --> 04:26.994
on the financial reporting operations. So again, this is a broad mix of

04:27.032 --> 04:30.734
Citywat Accounting and reporting operations from the Accounting

04:30.782 --> 04:34.858
Disaster Recovery to Fixed assets Management, grants Management

04:35.054 --> 04:38.546
including the trust Funds management and Accounts Receivable

04:38.738 --> 04:41.974
is at $6 million. Budget at

04:42.012 --> 04:45.942
29.2 FTEs. Strategic Procurement of course,

04:46.076 --> 04:50.194
as the name implies, handling the Citywide procurement,

04:50.242 --> 04:53.378
administrations Material Vendor Contract Management,

04:53.474 --> 04:57.738
peacock Administrations budget at 5.9

04:57.824 --> 05:01.210
million at 44.7 FTEs.

05:01.790 --> 05:05.246
And again we have the Performance Improvement divisions in

05:05.268 --> 05:09.006
here at 440,000. This is the Office of Innovations that

05:09.028 --> 05:12.954
deals with the citywide operational process improvement from citywide

05:13.002 --> 05:16.770
data analytics to smart city program management.

05:17.510 --> 05:21.140
Continuing on to the next slide, which is the revolving fund.

05:21.590 --> 05:25.574
This is budgeted at 7.5 million at 60.2

05:25.612 --> 05:29.110
FTEs. Again this slide.

05:29.450 --> 05:33.590
It provides financial services to fleet hits

05:34.250 --> 05:37.454
fire departments, grants management for Housing

05:37.522 --> 05:41.462
department. This fund also handles the Citywide

05:41.526 --> 05:45.450
Energy Financial Management as well as accounts payable function

05:45.520 --> 05:49.126
for certain departments. Director's Office budget

05:49.158 --> 05:53.034
at 1.4 million. This is the Fiscal Administrators

05:53.082 --> 05:56.714
to oversee the financial management for Hits and Fire departments.

05:56.842 --> 06:00.286
That includes the annual budget, monthly financial report and

06:00.308 --> 06:03.986
any ad hoc financial analysis. And in

06:04.008 --> 06:08.338
the treasury and Capital Management budget at 267,000.

06:08.424 --> 06:12.206
This is only two FTEs in here supporting client departments

06:12.238 --> 06:16.338
for Capital Planning and cost benefit analysis.

06:16.514 --> 06:20.600
This is for Fleet Hits and Fire

06:21.450 --> 06:25.602
as our client departments for the Capital Management

06:25.746 --> 06:29.370
financial planning analysis at 885.5

06:29.440 --> 06:33.254
thousand. This is at 5.3 FTEs.

06:33.382 --> 06:36.646
This is handling the Energy Financial Management supporting

06:36.678 --> 06:39.938
the fleet Departments sorry, Energy Financial

06:39.974 --> 06:43.386
Management for GSD and also supporting the Fleet Managements

06:43.498 --> 06:46.960
in their operating annual budget and monthly financial report.

06:48.130 --> 06:51.086
Strategic procurement at 1.3 million.

06:51.268 --> 06:54.850
We have 9.9 FTEs in here. This is again

06:54.920 --> 06:58.850
supporting the procurement for Fleets, Hits and Fire departments.

07:00.150 --> 07:03.090
One thing I want to note on the financial reporting operations,

07:03.590 --> 07:06.946
I don't know if I think I probably missed it. Financial reporting

07:06.978 --> 07:11.046
operations at 3.6 million. This is handling the Invoice reconciliations and

07:11.068 --> 07:15.142
payments for several departments including Hits, Public Works,

07:15.276 --> 07:18.934
Fire Departments and Planning as well as the payment on

07:18.972 --> 07:22.678
the Energy Management, that is the electricity and natural gas bills

07:22.774 --> 07:27.126
that we have to pay as well as the service chargeback processing

07:27.238 --> 07:31.260
including the EMS Billing. That is all in this revolving fund.

07:32.350 --> 07:36.622
Moving on to the next slide. Slide five again.

07:36.676 --> 07:39.838
I'm just going to go briefly again. You all know what we do in the

07:39.844 --> 07:43.394
Finance Department. This is the major services in the Finance departments is

07:43.432 --> 07:47.678
managing the Citywide Debt and Capital Management budgeting forecasting,

07:47.774 --> 07:51.330
citywide Energy Contracts, financial Reporting and Auditing,

07:51.830 --> 07:55.038
grants Management Oversight, Disaster Recovery as you're

07:55.054 --> 07:58.790
all aware, as well as the Cdwat procurement.

08:01.130 --> 08:04.962
Next slide on the statutory requirements

08:05.026 --> 08:08.914
for service delivery. I want to stress

08:08.962 --> 08:12.438
out, we do have to comply with the statute requirements

08:12.534 --> 08:16.102
for what we do in the Finance Department, that is from ensuring compliance

08:16.166 --> 08:19.882
with the Texas Tax Code and Propositions One and

08:19.936 --> 08:23.786
H to make sure that the city present a balanced budget in accordance

08:23.818 --> 08:27.706
with state law and financial policies. We also have to follow the federal

08:27.738 --> 08:30.846
and state compliance, including the procurement law that

08:30.868 --> 08:34.574
we have to out comply and also completion of the annual

08:34.622 --> 08:37.906
financial and single audit, again to be in compliance with the

08:37.928 --> 08:42.094
state and federal laws. So again, any mismanagement

08:42.142 --> 08:46.246
of these functions will be impacting the cities tremendously from

08:46.348 --> 08:50.274
uninformed decisions from you all and the mayor's procurement failure

08:50.322 --> 08:53.350
that will impact the surface delivery and city operations,

08:54.650 --> 08:58.198
to claw back the federal funds and even to defaulting of

08:58.204 --> 09:02.010
the city debt. So it is important for us in our function

09:02.080 --> 09:05.286
in the finance departments to comply with all of these laws

09:05.478 --> 09:09.210
for the sustainability of the city's operations.

09:10.110 --> 09:13.520
So let's start looking into the numbers at this point.

09:14.050 --> 09:17.280
I know we don't have the slides. So again, slide seven.

09:18.610 --> 09:22.462
So on the General fund, again, we have 2.1

09:22.516 --> 09:26.686
billion. The bulk of the property tax and sales tax is in the Finance Department's

09:26.718 --> 09:30.242
business area, $2.1 billion

09:30.296 --> 09:33.586
general fund in fiscal year 23, which is

09:33.768 --> 09:37.394
51.5 million higher compared to the fiscal year 22

09:37.432 --> 09:41.206
estimates. That is about 2.5% increase. I know

09:41.228 --> 09:45.062
we've went a great deal in the budget overview on the property tax

09:45.116 --> 09:48.426
and sales tax as we

09:48.448 --> 09:51.610
saw it initially. Again, to keep in mind,

09:51.680 --> 09:56.602
property tax and sales tax alone is comprised about 98.7%

09:56.656 --> 10:00.314
of the financial revenues in

10:00.352 --> 10:03.934
the revolving fund. We have about 7.5 million in here, but again,

10:03.972 --> 10:07.614
this is a surface chargeback so it is essential revenues as we

10:07.652 --> 10:11.390
recover the cost of providing financial services to this department.

10:12.610 --> 10:16.580
So the next slide, slide eight is going through the details again.

10:17.430 --> 10:21.554
Again, as we mentioned, our property tax is at $1.28

10:21.592 --> 10:25.154
billion, reflect an increase of 48.9 million

10:25.272 --> 10:28.566
compared to fiscal year 22 estimates. Again, this is

10:28.588 --> 10:31.462
based on the Propositions One and H and again,

10:31.516 --> 10:36.470
this is based on the CPI inflation rate of 4.28%

10:36.620 --> 10:40.346
and 0% growth of populations on

10:40.368 --> 10:43.180
the sales tax. Again, we've covered this before,

10:43.790 --> 10:47.210
our sales tax revenues is at $807,000,000,

10:47.280 --> 10:50.842
which is assuming no growth at this point. Again, we continue

10:50.896 --> 10:54.526
to monitor. We've seen some upticks in fiscal year 2022,

10:54.628 --> 10:58.350
but again, with so many uncertainties and even going through the consultant

10:59.010 --> 11:02.286
review, we felt that it's probably best to just keep it

11:02.308 --> 11:06.194
flat at this point because of those uncertainties in the inflations for

11:06.232 --> 11:10.370
fiscal year 23 budget for mixed beverage taxes at 20.7 million

11:10.520 --> 11:14.194
reflects about $570,000 increase from fiscal year 22

11:14.232 --> 11:17.746
estimates. Next slide,

11:17.858 --> 11:21.960
which is slide nine, this is the expenditure site on the again,

11:25.530 --> 11:28.666
a combined budget that we have in fiscal year 23 is

11:28.688 --> 11:32.234
about 28.3 million. 20.8 million

11:32.272 --> 11:35.962
is for General Fund and 7.5 of that is for

11:36.096 --> 11:37.980
thank you revolving Fund.

11:39.710 --> 11:42.510
So we'll go through the details in the next slide.

11:43.010 --> 11:46.494
Slide ten thank you.

11:46.532 --> 11:50.334
So, slide ten, this is just again the compositions on

11:50.372 --> 11:53.914
the general fund for the personnel versus non

11:53.962 --> 11:58.020
personnel. Again, personnel compress about 76%

11:58.950 --> 12:02.900
in the general fund of 15.8 million and

12:03.270 --> 12:06.614
24% or 5 million is the non personnel of

12:06.652 --> 12:10.134
which if you look at the pie charts on the right

12:10.332 --> 12:13.734
that comprise of billing collections about 1.3

12:13.772 --> 12:17.446
million. So that is the billing collections where we

12:17.468 --> 12:21.930
pay for the Harris County tax office for the property tax collected.

12:22.430 --> 12:25.770
We also have an audit, auditing contracts 1.6 million.

12:25.840 --> 12:29.274
This is with the auditing contracts for

12:29.312 --> 12:32.806
the year end audit that we work closely with the controller's

12:32.838 --> 12:36.346
office restricted account at 949,000 compressed

12:36.378 --> 12:39.902
about 19% and services which is 1.1 million.

12:39.956 --> 12:43.662
So this is where we have the printing costs, advertising costs,

12:43.806 --> 12:48.062
parking rentals and so some of those consultants

12:48.126 --> 12:52.370
happy with the outcome based budgeting for instance, is all in that services category.

12:54.230 --> 12:57.526
So now we look@the.net change from the fiscal year 22

12:57.548 --> 13:01.266
current budget on the next slide. So let's

13:01.298 --> 13:05.270
start with the operating budget in fiscal year 22 started at 17.9

13:05.340 --> 13:08.774
million. Again with the adjustment as

13:08.812 --> 13:11.258
you saw in the general appropriation, we have restricted account,

13:11.344 --> 13:15.206
hope and health benefits adjustment including the city council surplus

13:15.238 --> 13:19.174
for a one time adjustment that I graciously thank you for Fernita Jones

13:19.222 --> 13:23.086
office. So our fiscal year 22 current budget at

13:23.108 --> 13:26.574
this point with those adjustments at 19 million. So now

13:26.612 --> 13:30.686
moving on to the incremental increases to come up

13:30.708 --> 13:34.666
with our fiscal year 23. So again, that city council surplus

13:34.698 --> 13:38.206
is a one time adjustment. So we took it out this budget,

13:38.318 --> 13:41.938
it does include funding for ten new positions. So I did ask for

13:42.024 --> 13:45.494
funding for ten new positions in my departments. This is

13:45.532 --> 13:50.466
to help assisting the Strategic Procurement Grants

13:50.498 --> 13:53.334
offer site and also capital Management. Again,

13:53.372 --> 13:56.520
with this federal money that we have, we need more

13:57.050 --> 14:01.750
streamlined process and help in those procurement divisions

14:01.910 --> 14:05.642
as well as the Grants offer site. And so with that

14:05.696 --> 14:09.482
our changing from operating budget from

14:09.536 --> 14:12.958
fiscal year 22 reflect about 5.8%. Now I'm going

14:12.964 --> 14:16.590
to move on to restricted account and health benefits and hope pay increases.

14:17.250 --> 14:20.958
So those contractual mandate increases about 621,000.

14:21.044 --> 14:25.202
So in total our budget increased by 1.6

14:25.256 --> 14:29.234
million. So that comprised about 8.6% from the

14:29.272 --> 14:33.330
fiscal year 22 current budget. So those are the details that

14:33.400 --> 14:37.080
increase decrease from fiscal year 22 to fiscal year 23

14:37.690 --> 14:40.950
expenditures budget. Next slide.

14:41.770 --> 14:45.142
Again, I mentioned this briefly when we go through the net

14:45.196 --> 14:48.582
change again, our budget includes for both

14:48.716 --> 14:52.106
General fund and revolving fund, includes funding for health benefits,

14:52.208 --> 14:55.530
pension contributions and the 3% hope pay increases.

14:56.270 --> 15:00.278
Again in general fund it does include funding for ten new employees,

15:00.374 --> 15:03.390
new positions to keep up with the increasing workload.

15:04.210 --> 15:07.646
This is dealing with the Strategic procurement and the grants management as well as the

15:07.668 --> 15:11.646
capital and debt functions revolving fund. Again, this is just to

15:11.668 --> 15:15.134
provide funding for financial procurement

15:15.182 --> 15:18.834
and accounts payable receivable support to hit Fleet and

15:18.872 --> 15:22.146
Fire, as well as the

15:22.168 --> 15:25.886
energy management. Again, it's very straightforward.

15:25.998 --> 15:29.222
I think that's the end of my presentations and I'm open for any questions.

15:29.356 --> 15:32.710
Thank you, council Member Abby Cayman. Thank you,

15:32.860 --> 15:36.630
Director Emo. Again, I just wanted to thank you for all the

15:36.700 --> 15:40.602
work you and your team do, and even in other

15:40.736 --> 15:44.550
efforts that we as council are undertaking,

15:44.630 --> 15:47.674
we come to you and you're always willing to help us and support us.

15:47.712 --> 15:51.466
So thank you for making our jobs a lot easier.

15:51.578 --> 15:55.070
I'm going to be asking this question of every department.

15:56.610 --> 16:00.618
Given the significant budget constraints

16:00.714 --> 16:04.450
that the city continues to face, are there priority

16:04.870 --> 16:08.450
items that your department is not going to

16:08.520 --> 16:11.010
be getting in this budget?

16:12.710 --> 16:15.140
If not be getting yeah,

16:16.810 --> 16:20.520
thank you for asking that question. So, one thing's first.

16:22.410 --> 16:25.960
With the Pandemic and a lot of the grants funding we have,

16:27.130 --> 16:30.442
the first party I ask for the mayor, is to make sure that we have

16:30.496 --> 16:33.782
enough resources to carry those reporting

16:33.846 --> 16:37.450
and making sure that federal monies are spent in compliance.

16:37.870 --> 16:41.578
So I am gracious enough to get those decisions funded,

16:41.674 --> 16:45.898
as you see in this budget, and that includes the procurement groups.

16:46.074 --> 16:49.406
Again, we handle city wide functions in here

16:49.508 --> 16:53.474
from the grants offer side and the procurement. So I

16:53.512 --> 16:56.866
think I don't have anything else at

16:56.888 --> 17:00.194
this point. Again, it may change because,

17:00.232 --> 17:04.974
again, we've talked about great resignations and competitiveness

17:05.022 --> 17:08.566
with the market. And I think, again, this is happening in all across the

17:08.588 --> 17:12.502
board, that everybody's seeing that. And so I may come

17:12.556 --> 17:15.880
then. But at this point, since this is the start of the fiscal year,

17:16.490 --> 17:19.930
I have been graciously granted those funding.

17:20.510 --> 17:22.810
Thank you, Council Member Ed Pollard.

17:24.510 --> 17:28.442
Thank you, Mayor Pro Tim. And sorry if these questions were asked

17:28.496 --> 17:32.922
earlier, but I just wanted to kind of get a general overview

17:32.986 --> 17:37.242
for the public on just how financially sound stable

17:37.306 --> 17:41.054
we are currently. I know we throw out a lot of numbers and

17:41.092 --> 17:44.706
this is kind of a high level overview, but for the

17:44.728 --> 17:48.546
general person that's just tuning in, would you

17:48.568 --> 17:51.042
say that the city right now is financially sound?

17:51.176 --> 17:55.140
Yes. So I just want to point out, so for

17:56.010 --> 17:59.702
credit rating agencies to change their

17:59.756 --> 18:03.254
outlook from negative to stable is a great

18:03.292 --> 18:06.518
deal for the items that the

18:06.524 --> 18:09.706
mayor had accomplished with the pension reform and

18:09.728 --> 18:13.542
the OPEC reform. Those credit rating agencies

18:13.686 --> 18:16.860
really recognize the leadership, including you all,

18:17.230 --> 18:20.826
to managing the financials of the city of Houston. So, yes, we are

18:20.848 --> 18:24.346
currently financially sound. Are there any specific shortfalls

18:24.378 --> 18:26.320
that you see that we need to be aware of?

18:28.290 --> 18:31.374
It depends on where we go, where the path we are moving

18:31.412 --> 18:34.466
forward at this point. And I think that's why I stress enough about preserving this

18:34.488 --> 18:37.940
fund balance, because we can be in the path that we should.

18:38.630 --> 18:41.886
Has the administration identified

18:42.078 --> 18:45.298
specific allocations regarding the ARPA dollars

18:45.464 --> 18:48.326
that will be coming in that we need to be aware of.

18:48.508 --> 18:52.902
So I know I mentioned to you about we have $160,000,000

18:52.956 --> 18:56.662
of ARPA funding in here. And I know

18:56.796 --> 19:00.282
Mayor mentioned about the use of the ARPA dollars

19:00.416 --> 19:03.260
for the revenue losses in the next year.

19:03.950 --> 19:07.834
I know there's other projects that have

19:07.872 --> 19:11.194
been presented and I think you all have seen it as well. The ones if

19:11.232 --> 19:15.246
Houston, for example, is part of the ARPA fundings and

19:15.268 --> 19:18.270
I can give you the list, I think we have the ARPA website already open,

19:18.340 --> 19:22.318
so we can give you those details. Well, I want to thank you

19:22.404 --> 19:26.206
again as well for your leadership and your entire team. Thank you for all

19:26.228 --> 19:29.506
the hard work and the long nights. We all appreciate it. So thank

19:29.528 --> 19:33.378
you very much. Thank you. It means a lot. Council Member David Robinson. Thank you,

19:33.384 --> 19:36.930
Mayor Protem. And following on the line of my two colleagues with their last questions,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.438
I just want to say thank you for everything you're doing. I think this is

19:40.444 --> 19:43.574
a good wrap up to the last two days where we've heard from you,

19:43.612 --> 19:47.046
from the mayor in particular. And I know a moment ago when

19:47.068 --> 19:50.630
you were acknowledging your staff, who we all feel very strongly about, great job,

19:50.700 --> 19:54.166
everyone. You mentioned Vernita Jones, who was not in the chamber

19:54.198 --> 19:57.802
at the time, and Vernita is here. So I just wanted to call

19:57.856 --> 20:01.534
particular attention to her because she does a great job across the street taking

20:01.572 --> 20:05.360
care of us and

20:05.730 --> 20:10.122
our budgets for all our people. And to the point about impact

20:10.186 --> 20:13.438
of the great resignation, I know she's had a lot

20:13.444 --> 20:16.814
of work to do for a number of our offices. So I just wanted

20:16.852 --> 20:19.714
to ask you one follow up question to that. I don't know if she heard

20:19.752 --> 20:23.394
it. When she was absent, did you mean that you were zeroing out her

20:23.432 --> 20:26.934
budget? Is that right? I find that hard

20:26.972 --> 20:30.086
to believe. No. Okay. All right, thanks.

20:30.268 --> 20:33.094
Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you.

20:33.132 --> 20:37.080
And good for you for getting the ten new positions. I know you need them.

20:37.610 --> 20:41.030
In the big book, you mentioned as one of your performance measures

20:41.610 --> 20:45.002
getting in compliance with our financial policies 100%.

20:45.136 --> 20:48.266
I just see that we're out of compliance on just two of them. One has

20:48.288 --> 20:52.010
to do with internal controls and one on our credit rating.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.626
Can you explain a little bit further about how we're going to come in compliance

20:55.658 --> 20:59.310
with that? I think on the structurally balanced budget stuff, it's in progress,

20:59.810 --> 21:03.006
but those two were out of compliance. So can

21:03.028 --> 21:06.606
you talk about that? Yeah. So keep in mind when

21:06.628 --> 21:09.380
we have that and we keep our bar high,

21:09.830 --> 21:13.186
which is good. When we did the financial policy, I think

21:13.208 --> 21:16.606
it was based on fiscal year 2014, if I'm not mistaken.

21:16.798 --> 21:20.614
And a lot happened from fiscal year 2014 to now.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.974
So there was a time when we did get downgraded and I can't remember which

21:24.012 --> 21:27.826
one. And I think, like I said, we were having a negative outlook

21:27.858 --> 21:30.826
and so now we're moving back up. So we are in the right path just

21:30.848 --> 21:32.970
by that change from negative to stable.

21:35.950 --> 21:39.862
Let's start the change of the credit rating does not come overnight.

21:40.006 --> 21:43.146
So it takes some steps because they want to make sure how you run in

21:43.168 --> 21:46.126
that year and then the next year then they will change it. And so now

21:46.148 --> 21:49.550
the fact that we change from the negative to stable is good. So the next

21:49.620 --> 21:53.630
hope is with all this preserve fund balance, hopefully we would get those

21:53.700 --> 21:57.326
additional increase in the credit rating so that we can go back to the compliance

21:57.438 --> 22:01.250
compared to fiscal year 14. On the risk assessment,

22:02.150 --> 22:05.486
there was part of our budget reductions, to be honest with you, with the internal

22:05.518 --> 22:08.774
audit, again, during fiscal year 14 to now, a lot of things happen.

22:08.812 --> 22:12.194
The economy landscape has changed. So there was budget reductions

22:12.242 --> 22:15.734
on the internal audit, so there was out of compliance. So we

22:15.772 --> 22:19.366
are going back to see what we can do to put it back

22:19.468 --> 22:22.730
in the compliance state. Okay, great. And I have some questions on

22:22.800 --> 22:26.506
specific line items within general government and you're the appropriate person to

22:26.528 --> 22:29.914
send those to correct? I mean, you can do that. I can

22:29.952 --> 22:33.878
tell you the dollars on what so some of the operating

22:34.054 --> 22:37.274
questions are probably will have to defer, but okay, we'll do those in writing.

22:37.322 --> 22:40.730
Thank you. Thank you. And there are no other council members in queue.

22:40.810 --> 22:43.870
And I made these comments yesterday.

22:44.450 --> 22:48.014
The City of Houston budget is made up by the administration,

22:48.142 --> 22:51.554
you and your staff and the mayor and presented to us and we make

22:51.592 --> 22:55.074
amendments to it. But our final vote is either yes or no. We either

22:55.112 --> 22:58.738
accept it or we reject it. I think this

22:58.824 --> 23:02.022
budget is in the best shape of any budget I dealt with in my

23:02.076 --> 23:05.606
nine years here. And it's because of you and your team and the

23:05.628 --> 23:09.642
diligence that we put forward a year ago when we saw sales

23:09.696 --> 23:13.146
tax revenue and a lot of our revenue gone down and we

23:13.168 --> 23:16.460
made some specific budgetary cuts and

23:17.150 --> 23:20.390
we see the good of those. So thanks for your leadership,

23:20.550 --> 23:24.474
always enjoy working with you and your deputy

23:24.522 --> 23:28.286
directors, mr. Jones and Ms. Dabowski, and your entire team. You all do

23:28.308 --> 23:32.542
a great job day in and day out in a tough environment and thanks

23:32.596 --> 23:36.142
for everything you do. And I do believe this budget process is

23:36.276 --> 23:39.378
hopefully going to be one of the smoothest ones we see because of some of

23:39.384 --> 23:43.022
the pain that you saw coming and you made adjustments,

23:43.086 --> 23:47.394
you and your team. So thanks for that. We do have three virtual public speakers.

23:47.442 --> 23:51.990
The first is Saba Blanding star

23:52.060 --> 23:53.830
Six. Again, Ms. Blanding.

23:56.950 --> 23:58.980
Star six. There you go.

24:01.290 --> 24:04.790
Yes. Okay. There I'm unmuted. Can you hear me okay?

24:04.860 --> 24:07.430
Yes. Wonderful.

24:08.330 --> 24:12.266
I have a question kind of two sides of probably the

24:12.288 --> 24:16.106
same coin. You mentioned the high number of Vacancies going into

24:16.128 --> 24:19.722
the budget cycle. Why is

24:19.776 --> 24:23.270
retention an issue for your department beyond

24:23.350 --> 24:26.510
the great resignation and how can we improve it?

24:26.660 --> 24:30.666
And then kind of alongside that and maybe kindred

24:30.698 --> 24:34.670
to what council member came in, asked earlier. I'm just really curious,

24:35.010 --> 24:38.450
in a perfect world, how many employees does

24:38.520 --> 24:42.418
your department need ideally? Like what would be the perfect number

24:42.584 --> 24:46.930
and what type of kind of similar to this, what type of pay increases

24:47.270 --> 24:51.060
would there be ideally? So I have a more pragmatic question about

24:51.450 --> 24:54.726
Vacancies and retention and improving it

24:54.748 --> 24:58.226
and then just kind of I would like to know the ideal

24:58.258 --> 25:01.766
number of employees so we can kind of know the difference between what's

25:01.798 --> 25:03.740
happening and what is needed.

25:04.670 --> 25:08.998
Okay, so it's

25:09.014 --> 25:12.780
an interesting question. Let's start with the Vacancies at this point.

25:14.850 --> 25:18.666
So we are in the general fund departments, and you've

25:18.698 --> 25:22.750
gone through the budget presentations with our limited revenue sources.

25:23.490 --> 25:27.870
And so we have to continuously looking for efficiencies

25:28.030 --> 25:31.822
and process improvements in the finance and city department.

25:31.886 --> 25:35.154
Citywide, what happened with the

25:35.192 --> 25:38.618
Pandemic? I think it changed and I think you probably know this too, it changed

25:38.654 --> 25:42.902
the landscape of the global mindset of

25:43.036 --> 25:47.942
employees and employer too, right? So some

25:47.996 --> 25:51.486
private sectors can provide those flexibilities that we don't

25:51.538 --> 25:54.540
at the city of Houston, right? Because the work is different.

25:55.310 --> 25:58.890
We have people who have to be here meeting citizens.

26:00.670 --> 26:02.700
And the pay the market study,

26:04.050 --> 26:07.818
again, it's hard to compete

26:07.914 --> 26:11.694
with the private sectors. Of course, when you do a market study, you compare with

26:11.732 --> 26:14.270
the same government, municipal employees.

26:14.930 --> 26:18.720
And so we continuously looking at that. And of course it's a

26:19.170 --> 26:22.606
vicious cycle, if I can say. The more work you do, the more burned

26:22.638 --> 26:26.654
out you are, and then the more you are looking for other position elsewhere.

26:26.782 --> 26:30.006
And so that's what happened. Retentions at the same time, because you

26:30.028 --> 26:34.662
don't have enough people and you are overworked pay

26:34.716 --> 26:38.280
increases, an ideal number of people.

26:38.650 --> 26:42.422
And I can go back on the previous years

26:42.476 --> 26:45.746
when we don't have any all of these cuts and to see what those

26:45.788 --> 26:49.562
numbers are, you're probably looking at back in 2010 or

26:49.616 --> 26:53.602
I mean 2008, if anything. Right. And I have to look at this FTEs

26:53.686 --> 26:57.550
number. But those are difficult

26:57.620 --> 27:01.486
situations to handle at this point, especially when you deal with the competitiveness with

27:01.508 --> 27:05.230
the market. Thank you, jason Oliver,

27:13.510 --> 27:17.298
before, there has been conversation about

27:17.464 --> 27:21.522
unmet needs I'm really kind of interested in

27:21.656 --> 27:24.726
because some departments come up and they say we're not able to do X,

27:24.748 --> 27:28.038
Y and Z because of the limitations or because of the

27:28.044 --> 27:31.666
cuts that we've made. And I'm less clear on how

27:31.708 --> 27:34.950
that is working with the finance department.

27:35.030 --> 27:39.674
So I'm interested and I'm curious about these kind of unmet needs for

27:39.792 --> 27:43.130
finance. And then you had talked about a market

27:43.200 --> 27:46.814
study comparing to municipal employees. You said

27:46.852 --> 27:50.654
that we had kind of leveled out legal. And I'm wondering if we

27:50.692 --> 27:54.394
are competitive if we're looking at municipal finance

27:54.442 --> 27:58.654
employees. And I wanted to circle back to the outcomes

27:58.702 --> 28:02.046
based budgeting because I'm

28:02.078 --> 28:06.130
interested in if it's possible, like will you modify

28:06.550 --> 28:10.818
your you had talked about changing your budget calendar during the last presentation,

28:10.994 --> 28:14.274
so I'm wondering if you'll be modifying

28:14.322 --> 28:17.478
it to better incorporate public input. For example,

28:17.564 --> 28:20.982
many cities hold public workshops both before and

28:21.036 --> 28:24.934
after a proposed budget is released to really get the community knowledgeable

28:24.982 --> 28:28.326
about what's in there and make sure that their priorities are included.

28:28.438 --> 28:31.706
So three things. First is unmet needs. Second,

28:31.808 --> 28:34.622
competitive based on municipal employees. And then third,

28:34.676 --> 28:38.586
about modifying the budget calendar as we shift

28:38.698 --> 28:41.934
to outcomes based budgeting. Can you say the first

28:41.972 --> 28:45.200
one again? Unmet needs. Unmet needs.

28:45.810 --> 28:49.954
Okay, thank you. So again, I mentioned in

28:49.992 --> 28:53.218
some of my slide on the finance departments, what we do in

28:53.224 --> 28:57.858
the finance department is a

28:57.864 --> 29:01.158
lot of that is actually compliance with the

29:01.164 --> 29:05.254
state and federal regulations. Right? You're talking about the

29:05.292 --> 29:08.454
procurement, talking about, again,

29:08.652 --> 29:13.714
the debt management making sure that we are not mismanaging

29:13.762 --> 29:17.494
those and you don't want to have any stations when we are at the default.

29:17.542 --> 29:21.078
At this point, the budget, which is again is governed

29:21.094 --> 29:25.214
in the state and local policies and

29:25.252 --> 29:27.950
again the grants disaster recovery.

29:28.450 --> 29:31.726
What we do is essentially essential to

29:31.748 --> 29:35.582
the city. And so I cannot say that I would not be

29:35.716 --> 29:40.478
meeting those functions because it's

29:40.494 --> 29:42.740
a must in that sense.

29:43.350 --> 29:46.546
So, yeah, I cannot say that I cannot meet

29:46.728 --> 29:50.838
any demands because the function that we do are

29:51.004 --> 29:54.486
directly affecting out of

29:54.508 --> 29:58.134
compliance of the city to the state and

29:58.332 --> 30:01.734
local charter. So the impact is

30:01.772 --> 30:04.858
maybe, I don't know, maybe a late payment if that is the case. But of

30:04.864 --> 30:08.566
course it bites you back because then you have to pay late fees.

30:08.598 --> 30:12.726
For example, going back to your comment, it's not unmet

30:12.758 --> 30:15.566
needs, but I probably will have a delay if I don't have enough people in

30:15.588 --> 30:18.798
the procurements. But you don't want to have a wrong product

30:18.884 --> 30:23.230
being delivered or you don't want to have a wrong scope being written.

30:23.650 --> 30:26.810
So again, those expertise in my area

30:26.900 --> 30:30.574
is very crucial because what we do is going to be affecting

30:30.622 --> 30:34.094
the entire city's operations. So I cannot stress

30:34.142 --> 30:37.570
enough the city wide functions that our departments handles.

30:38.710 --> 30:42.086
So the last comment you have is the outcome based budgeting we

30:42.108 --> 30:45.926
will have. And I think Mr. Jones had mentioned to you we

30:45.948 --> 30:49.126
do have the Plan Houston process, and I

30:49.148 --> 30:52.962
think the input that we want from the public is the priorities. Exactly what

30:53.036 --> 30:56.700
do you want to see the city spend the dollars?

30:57.150 --> 31:01.082
The outcome based budgeting is just a vision on how

31:01.216 --> 31:04.634
it's going to look like. But I think the key that you are trying

31:04.672 --> 31:08.666
to get is the input of the public for those priorities.

31:08.858 --> 31:12.014
And I believe that is already in place. But I can double check,

31:12.052 --> 31:15.600
but those are the priorities that need some input from the public.

31:20.470 --> 31:23.570
Thank you. Next speaker is Mr. Doug Smith.

31:25.590 --> 31:28.894
Thank you. I just want to go back to a question I asked earlier

31:28.942 --> 31:30.610
that didn't get answered.

31:32.070 --> 31:35.478
We received $300 million of ARPA funds and

31:35.564 --> 31:39.462
we're going to get another 300 million. And the first 300 million

31:39.516 --> 31:42.854
was used last year. And then this coming budget, if I

31:42.892 --> 31:46.426
understand correctly, but you're addressing the budget gap does

31:46.448 --> 31:49.898
not take into consideration the next 300

31:49.984 --> 31:53.034
million that we're going to receive. So that's one question.

31:53.232 --> 31:57.510
And then is there somewhere how you calculated

31:57.590 --> 32:01.722
the property tax? Because when I look at the projected

32:01.786 --> 32:04.734
increase, it's 3.9% over 2022.

32:04.772 --> 32:08.078
And I thought the state law and I

32:08.084 --> 32:11.746
don't know the state law, but I thought the state law mandated a three

32:11.768 --> 32:15.442
and a half percent increase. So I would like to see how that

32:15.496 --> 32:18.420
calculation was done. And finally,

32:19.270 --> 32:23.286
in the raw data under other interfund services,

32:23.388 --> 32:29.238
which I understand you explained well, there's revenues of $7,400,000.

32:29.404 --> 32:33.250
And where does that revenue appear? If it does appear

32:33.410 --> 32:37.066
in page 625 where you

32:37.088 --> 32:40.314
list all of your revenues, those are my

32:40.352 --> 32:44.140
questions. Okay. So I think

32:44.510 --> 32:48.506
correct me if I'm wrong if I get it right, your questions. The ARPA

32:48.538 --> 32:52.362
dollar that we are receiving or to be received

32:52.426 --> 32:57.262
is $607,000,000. About $303,000,000

32:57.316 --> 33:01.610
has been received last May. Another 303,000,000 will be received

33:01.770 --> 33:03.280
sometimes this month.

33:04.710 --> 33:07.954
This includes the allocations of

33:07.992 --> 33:11.234
ARPA of 160,000,000 at this point. That came

33:11.272 --> 33:14.360
from the first tranche, which is $303,000,000.

33:15.690 --> 33:19.254
Great. Yes. Thank you. That's what I thought. And the

33:19.292 --> 33:23.174
next 300 million, you did not take that into consideration when

33:23.212 --> 33:25.922
you talked about addressing the budget gap.

33:26.066 --> 33:29.786
You said that you didn't include that in what the proposed gap might be.

33:29.808 --> 33:33.526
Is that a correct statement? So the next tranche,

33:33.558 --> 33:37.274
again, we have the one safe Houston. We have other stuff that has already been

33:37.472 --> 33:40.526
included in the ARPA. And I know

33:40.548 --> 33:44.222
I included projected gap for fiscal year 24,

33:44.276 --> 33:47.854
with the hope is to also use the ARPA money then. But again,

33:47.892 --> 33:51.330
that will be from the second tranche. Correct me if I'm wrong.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.762
ARPA funds can be used until December 31,

33:53.816 --> 33:57.074
2023. 424. Got it.

33:57.112 --> 34:00.818
So 24. Okay. For us,

34:00.984 --> 34:04.294
yes. The second questions you have is on,

34:04.332 --> 34:07.270
I believe is it on the property tax calculations?

34:08.490 --> 34:12.870
Yes. Because you're showing a projected 3.9%

34:12.940 --> 34:16.822
increase. And I thought that new state law mandated

34:16.886 --> 34:21.434
a three and a half percent increase. And I just like to understand how

34:21.472 --> 34:25.500
that plays against our own property tax cap.

34:32.690 --> 34:35.902
So I know our proposed budget is including the

34:35.956 --> 34:39.970
4.28% increase of

34:40.040 --> 34:43.634
the CPI, but remember, we also

34:43.672 --> 34:46.660
have the 90 million on the Prop H.

34:47.270 --> 34:50.930
And I can go back to you again to reconcile

34:51.850 --> 34:55.526
the 3.97% versus the 4.23 of

34:55.548 --> 34:59.254
the CPI number, but some of that could be from

34:59.292 --> 35:02.280
the Prop H.

35:03.850 --> 35:07.434
Okay, well, okay. What about the state cap is three.

35:07.472 --> 35:10.700
And a half percent. How does that play into this?

35:13.310 --> 35:16.794
I will have to get back to you on those

35:16.832 --> 35:20.254
details on the calculations. I think there's also some

35:20.292 --> 35:24.414
other annexations maybe included in the fiscal year 22

35:24.612 --> 35:28.078
budget. Again, annexation is only when it's available

35:28.164 --> 35:31.374
and only for twelve months. You don't use annexations every single year.

35:31.492 --> 35:35.214
So maybe some other stuff in the fiscal year 22 estimates.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.686
Just a reminder of any additional questions. If you want to send to District

35:38.718 --> 35:42.162
E at houstontx Gov, we will answer them and get back to you.

35:42.216 --> 35:45.814
A reminder to the council members council members should

35:45.852 --> 35:49.206
submit any department budget workshop questions in a Word document and

35:49.228 --> 35:53.334
we'll upload that to SharePoint and departments have been

35:53.372 --> 35:57.414
directed to provide responses within 48 hours of the conclusion

35:57.462 --> 36:00.794
of their presentation. Department responses will

36:00.832 --> 36:04.554
also be uploaded on SharePoint and give us two

36:04.592 --> 36:08.102
minutes and we'll transition. And my apologies to Chief Pena,

36:08.166 --> 36:11.526
Chief West and Ms. McHenry for the delay.

36:11.638 --> 36:14.730
I'm sure your presentation will be worth it.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.646
So thank you. We will transition and Vice Chair Ed Pollard

36:18.678 --> 36:21.380
will be sitting here two minutes.
