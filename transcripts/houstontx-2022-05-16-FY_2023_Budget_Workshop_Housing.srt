1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,582
We'll now adjourn for a second and begin

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,520
our budget workshop on the Housing Department. Thank you.

3
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,370
This time I'd like to welcome Director Keith Bottom and Ms. Tamika Jones

4
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,390
to provide the Houston Housing Department budget presentation.

5
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,890
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

6
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,334
Joining me today is my assistant

7
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:51,230
director and Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Tamika Jones.

8
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,030
If we go through the next slide,

9
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,014
we are a department of acronyms. So here's a list

10
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:04,002
of all the acronyms that we use. So we just wanted to provide

11
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:06,740
you with that. If you go to the next slide, please.

12
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,166
For the General Fund, we are probably the smallest budget you

13
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:19,826
will see. At this budget hearing. We are projected

14
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:23,238
to get $411,604

15
00:01:23,404 --> 00:01:26,982
representing FTEs of 0.3.

16
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:30,170
That 0.3 is represented by personnel.

17
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:37,162
And you'll see the FY 23 budget of 135,493,

18
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:41,322
which is the three which is part of my salary

19
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:44,746
as well as employee exit costs,

20
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:49,194
as benefit termination pay and workers compensation.

21
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:53,454
And then the other side of that chart, you'll see the other services and

22
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:59,890
charges which represent $276,111

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,678
which covers janitorial, rent and other miscellaneous

24
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:05,990
chargebacks. Next slide.

25
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,750
Let me get a little closer.

26
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,140
All right. Is that better? All right. Thank you.

27
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,854
If you go to that slide, you'll see all of department programming.

28
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:27,654
You'll see single family home repair and reconstruction.

29
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:31,326
Single family new construction, home buyer assistance and

30
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:34,990
home buyer choice. Multifamily programs,

31
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,110
public facilities and public services. Next slide.

32
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,130
Our general fund revenue overview. You'll see on General

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,082
Fund from FY 21, we were just under half

34
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,650
million. And now in FY 23,

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,480
we're at 411 six four

36
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,502
from the previous year. That's a reduction of $6,114,

37
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:06,310
a 1.4% reduction.

38
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,830
Next slide,

39
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,554
expenditures by category. You will

40
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,914
see on the expenditures and we can go by those.

41
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:19,274
And in purpose of saving time, we'll just look at

42
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:24,830
FY 23, the proposed It's 135 493

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,206
for personnel, 160 for

44
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:29,338
office rent,

45
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:33,630
99,084 for restricted accounts

46
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,130
and then other services and charges just over 17,000

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,060
for a total again of 411,604.

48
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,042
The next slide is our personnel versus

49
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,838
non personnel. And you will see here that

50
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:54,470
personnel relates to 33%.

51
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,460
Non personnel is 67% of those dollars.

52
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,522
Next slide. Our general fund

53
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,060
budget expenditures. Again, in order to

54
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,422
save a little time, you can see that previous

55
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:15,066
year we were 417,718

56
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:18,542
compared to the current proposed of

57
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:23,698
411 604. Again a 1.46%

58
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:26,370
reduction. Next slide.

59
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,190
And the next one on this one is our organization

60
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,750
chart. So you can see the current organization.

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,066
To the right, you will see all of the people who report directly

62
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:43,718
to me. And as of today,

63
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:48,058
we can add an additional person. Kanesha London is now

64
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:52,090
my new assistant Director in charge of Compliance.

65
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,314
But that chart to the left is the chart that

66
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:59,702
represents individual departments who receive

67
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,342
funding and represent employees in those

68
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:06,766
other departments which total to 88

69
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:10,800
employees that are funded through us,

70
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,354
along with our 266 employees for

71
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:20,130
a total of 354 employees.

72
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,066
Next chart. And that chart just gives you some of the

73
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:27,686
demographics. Let you know that the

74
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,186
department is 39% male, 61% female,

75
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,470
and then the ethnic breakdown of the department.

76
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,702
Next slide our

77
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,642
FY 2023 new awards. This is a breakdown of

78
00:05:43,696 --> 00:05:47,286
the anticipated funding that we will be receiving.

79
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:51,162
And you can see CDBG. Turs HOPWA

80
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,958
home Emergency shelter. Grant Our

81
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:59,550
State Homeless Housing Fund and general fund

82
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,310
add up to just over $62 million.

83
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,154
And then you can see the chart. To the right is a breakdown of 40%.

84
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:11,102
Of that funding is CDBG 18% Hopper,

85
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,526
17% home, 19% Turs,

86
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:18,230
3% ESG, and then the

87
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,766
Texas Housing bond money is 2%.

88
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,798
And then the general fund dollar is zero

89
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:27,240
point 66%.

90
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,946
And that is our presentation. Thank you,

91
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:35,814
Director. And people may be sitting here saying, why do we even do a budget

92
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,574
for a department that has balance or revenue

93
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:43,422
stream, expense stream of $411,000?

94
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:46,654
It's because of that last slide. It's because of the flow through.

95
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:50,394
It's because of all the money that goes from agencies,

96
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:54,414
whether it's the federal government Glo into your department and

97
00:06:54,452 --> 00:06:58,546
then out. It gives us the opportunity to ask questions of you,

98
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:01,906
because last time we saw you both together, it wasn't a pretty

99
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:05,730
picture we were looking at. So I guess my initial question

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,510
is how is that going on the Glo side? Because we still

101
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,426
are hearing from residents that even though this is a budget workshop,

102
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,040
411,000 isn't a lot.

103
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,422
But at the same time, I'd like to just get a quick status update

104
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:23,626
on how things are going, how can

105
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:27,146
we help your department move things forward and what

106
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:31,066
do we need to do? So the

107
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:34,314
gist of it is, the last time we were in front of this committee,

108
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:37,790
that was just after September 21,

109
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,742
when all things changed in our department. Since then

110
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:45,822
and at that point when we met, we were having some significant

111
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:49,618
challenges with the Glo. Some of those challenges have not

112
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:53,666
totally gone away, but we have a more workable relationship with

113
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:57,190
the Glo now. We've made some significant progress.

114
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,974
Many of the programs that they put on hold are now starting

115
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:04,680
to be released and we're moving forward.

116
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,114
Our single family program that the Glo took

117
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:12,518
back, the only part that the department

118
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:15,734
kept was the pieces that were still in the pipeline.

119
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,910
That program is now winding down and we anticipate that program will

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,386
be completely wound down by mid to late

121
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:27,230
summer. So we are making some significant improvements.

122
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,920
The multifamily program, which has always been

123
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,350
one of the carrots in our portfolio,

124
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,634
has done extremely well. We have also had

125
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:42,930
some challenges with the Glo in accepting and moving forward.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,094
We provided them with loads of information so we

127
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:51,110
can start moving those programs forward. So overall,

128
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,934
we have made some significant improvements. There are some things

129
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:58,794
some of our programs have been slowed simply because of

130
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:02,860
primarily the pandemic. Some of those changes are

131
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,780
due to supply chain issues,

132
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,182
a lack of inventory. We have a significant home

133
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:15,242
down payment, first time Home Buyers Assistance

134
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:18,958
Program. But the inventory is starting to dry up and

135
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:22,714
it's very difficult to provide that housing when individuals

136
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,174
can't find it. But we are making some significant

137
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:29,362
improvements since the last time we've been here. Thank you.

138
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,834
Council Member Abby Cayman. Thank you.

139
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:37,478
And Director, I really want to congratulate you. You have always

140
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:41,350
been with the department for your extended tenure,

141
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,990
leading with such dignity,

142
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,894
consistency, and diligence. So thank

143
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:51,900
you and to your entire staff. I also really want to commend you all.

144
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,378
We've been hearing around the Horseshoe how important

145
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:59,702
especially, I want to say, with single family homes

146
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:04,314
in that program and the rebuilding, the flexibility that we have afforded homeowners

147
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:08,414
that other I will say state agencies have

148
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:11,726
not afforded that flexibility in

149
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:14,818
terms of rebuilds and things like that. And I think that's a really big success

150
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:19,010
story that we are seeing on the ground here. We just did a groundbreaking

151
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,580
halfway kind of checkbox on some

152
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,774
multifamily housing in the district that we're seeing in

153
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:31,240
real time all of the progress that we're making.

154
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,266
I'm a little concerned, just as we're seeing and Mayor

155
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:38,380
Pro TEM talked about this, the housing market,

156
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,586
the affordability of housing right now. And with you

157
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:47,210
saying about that inventory drying up in terms of single family home availability,

158
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,180
a little concerned about that. And we'll submit some questions

159
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,102
through the portal, but I appreciate you raising that. My one

160
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,318
question is, given the constraints that we have as a

161
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,886
city financially, and I'm asking every department this, what are the

162
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:05,666
needs that are currently not being addressed that you foresee can be a

163
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:09,074
challenge for the city either near term or

164
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:12,962
down the road? Well, I think the biggest need is

165
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:16,774
perhaps asking for additional or more money coming from

166
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:20,886
general fund. All of the dollars that we typically use

167
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:25,234
or have available are going to be tied to the federal

168
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:28,694
government, except for the tourist money. But the tourist money

169
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:32,202
is already predetermined what we're going to do with that in most

170
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:35,514
cases. But we have a

171
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:39,146
tremendous amount of need in the city when it

172
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:42,122
comes to individuals who need their home repaired.

173
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:46,174
And because of some of the restrictions that come with

174
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:50,474
the federal dollar, it becomes very difficult to assist

175
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:52,990
individuals who are not homeowners.

176
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,238
I am a little bit challenged with trying to assist just renters

177
00:11:58,414 --> 00:12:02,482
in general, because we don't want to enhance a property that

178
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:06,246
they don't control. And we enhance that property, then the

179
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:11,302
property owner comes back and either increases their rent or

180
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:15,510
even worst case scenario, puts them out in order to get more value

181
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,366
for that property. So it becomes very challenging to assist

182
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:23,206
renters, but we also find ourselves finding

183
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:26,874
it being very challenging assisting individuals who

184
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,726
can't meet all of the needs, even though they may be the homeowner,

185
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:34,762
but they don't have everything in place to prove that they're the homeowner.

186
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:38,542
So they've been in the home for a number of years, may have been

187
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:42,058
awarded the home through someone's passing,

188
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:45,698
but they didn't do all of the things necessary to

189
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:49,726
put the property in their name. So they still technically

190
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:53,406
cannot prove that they are the homeowner. So it becomes very challenging

191
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:56,850
when you're trying to use federal dollars to assist those individuals.

192
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,934
That's why it would be better if we had additional general fund dollars

193
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:02,710
that would be more flexible.

194
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,662
Thank you. We have about ten public

195
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:11,818
speakers that signed up, so we'll go through the list real quick.

196
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:15,222
The first we have is Mr. Christopher Rivera,

197
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:18,970
who is joining us virtually. Christopher star six to unmute.

198
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,530
Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Great.

199
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,466
Thank you. Housing programs becoming increasingly

200
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:31,422
important due to the rising costs of living. This year, the Housing and Community

201
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:35,042
Development Department will only receive 0.1% of the city's general

202
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:38,706
budget. Local reports indicate rent has gone

203
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:42,514
up 22% in Houston, and just last week there were 783

204
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:45,726
Evictions filed. We are facing a housing crisis,

205
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,074
and the city continues to cut funding that keeps our community safe.

206
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:53,000
In the last ten years, the housing budget has decreased by 82%.

207
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,174
The city of Houston is only one federal budget cut away from

208
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:01,494
a housing program disaster, an impact that will be felt by low income families

209
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:05,082
who will lose everything. My questions are,

210
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:08,746
how will the Housing and Community Development Department work to secure a

211
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:12,230
self sufficient budget, one that moves away from reliance

212
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,886
on federal funds? Why has the funding for

213
00:14:15,908 --> 00:14:19,262
the Housing Department decreased by 83% in the last ten years?

214
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:22,454
And why does this department rely so heavily on federal

215
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:26,002
grants? Thank you. I didn't hear the last

216
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:30,530
question. Why are we dependent upon federal grants? Was his last comment.

217
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,954
The city of Houston is an entitlement city. We get the majority

218
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:40,146
of our funding does come from the federal government. Majority of that funding

219
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:44,230
is coming from HUD. We get funding

220
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,020
through a number of programs, through HUD CDBG, which is our

221
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,770
normal funding source. We also have home. We also

222
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,890
have ESG programming.

223
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,926
That has always been the way the department has been set up and the way

224
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:03,870
the city has been set up to receive funding from HUD.

225
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,974
The dollar amount that we receive is based on a formula that

226
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:12,446
has been preset. That formula was

227
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:15,794
designed in the late 60s, early 70s.

228
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:20,114
That number has been the same, and we have not been able to

229
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:24,798
get her to deviate from the current formula.

230
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:28,598
Even though we are growing in size and have grown in size since

231
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:32,306
the original formula

232
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:35,926
was created, it has not adjusted anywhere in the country.

233
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:39,882
And there are some cities who are not as large as us receive much

234
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:44,042
more funding than we do. But it was based on the formula and amount of

235
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,100
need that those cities had at that time.

236
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,702
We've inquired, we've asked, but the

237
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:54,030
formula has not yet been changed.

238
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,160
I don't have a really good answer about how

239
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,834
to get an increase in

240
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:07,230
funding from the city. We can ask for additional

241
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,642
general fund dollar, but that is a budget issue.

242
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:13,220
That is always going to be a budget issue.

243
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,094
Sorry, go ahead. When it comes

244
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:23,058
to assisting individuals that were facing eviction,

245
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:28,186
we are currently dealing with some funding that we did have that

246
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,974
is dealing with individuals who are in the midst of being evicted

247
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:33,340
at the present time.

248
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,300
Great. Thank you.

249
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,330
In person, Mr. Jason oliver.

250
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,666
Hi director bynum thank you for your presentation.

251
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:56,094
First, I noticed, and there was a recent county

252
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:59,954
report that basically showed that we have almost none of

253
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:03,714
the necessary supply for what's described as extremely low

254
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:07,426
income, zero to 30% median household

255
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:11,526
income housing. Is the department set up to even

256
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:16,514
shift that severe

257
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:19,570
need at all? Yeah,

258
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,846
that's my first question. I missed

259
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:27,766
the beginning of your question where you said you saw the statistics

260
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,194
that came that said what? So there is a

261
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:35,050
severe shortage in the supply for extremely low income,

262
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,070
like zero to 30% median household income housing,

263
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,566
and we're just in no way equipped to provide to

264
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:46,578
meet that need and that demand in the near future.

265
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:50,194
Well, we are trying to meet the demand in

266
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:53,922
a number of ways. It's very difficult in single

267
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:57,186
family ownership. We do try to do a

268
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:01,014
better job in trying to meet it in the rental market. So we are

269
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:05,062
trying to provide that in a number of opportunities by

270
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:09,202
preventing or asking all of our developers to look at an

271
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:13,062
array of income

272
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:17,094
structures so we can provide rental

273
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:20,422
units for all of the streams of income

274
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:23,982
in the city. It is very difficult because there is a large

275
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,706
pool in that group versus the number of units

276
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:30,960
that we can put on the market. Okay. And then

277
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,662
this is, I guess, a question for council, because you've come here saying

278
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:39,074
that you need the time has expired, which council members

279
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:42,398
are supportive of an amendment to allocate more general funds

280
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:45,842
for the housing department so that you can address the issues that you talked about

281
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:48,260
before. Thank you. Thank you.

282
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,870
Baba Blandy.

283
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,774
Hi, good afternoon. I'll start by reiterating Jason's questions

284
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:02,134
and use my time to answer that. And I also

285
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:04,140
want to follow up on Christopher's question.

286
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,506
And a lot of times I've come up here and asked, like, what could you

287
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:12,300
do with more? But I'm actually curious. It was

288
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,666
very shocking to me that in ten years, your budget has dropped

289
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,774
by 83%. You went from almost 2.5.

290
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,134
The next year was like, 1.4, and then it dropped to like,

291
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:27,522
677. And then even in the past seven years, it's been reduced by 38%.

292
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:31,234
And I'm just curious, how has this impacted you all's ability to

293
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:33,090
provide for the city of Houston?

294
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,466
I know, like, what can we do to increase the housing department resources to

295
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:41,466
meet the needs. I know you've mentioned increasing the general fund budget, so I'm going

296
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:44,786
to circle that back to Jason's question. What council

297
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:47,974
members are open to a budget amendment to give our city what we

298
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:51,514
need? Because you don't need

299
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:54,822
to be here 2 seconds before you see how many people are unhoused.

300
00:19:54,886 --> 00:19:58,940
And we know how insane the housing market is here.

301
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,246
So, Director, isn't it true that we

302
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:08,826
have additional dollars that your department utilizes for housing

303
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:12,078
that's outside of just the general budget, federal dollars,

304
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:16,446
state dollars, grant dollars that are just not encompassed

305
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:19,970
in your presentation today? That is correct. We would

306
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,566
also have access to the tourist dollars. And the tourist

307
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:27,186
dollars are designed

308
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:30,514
to help with the development of affordable

309
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,560
housing. Can we go back to slide twelve?

310
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,804
Sorry, Council Member Pollard, is it okay if I just track real quick

311
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:45,576
to what you asked? Well, let me get his response

312
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:49,164
to this. I just want to clarify where

313
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:53,004
all of the resources that your

314
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:56,732
department is utilizing for housing needs within the city of Houston,

315
00:20:56,796 --> 00:21:00,912
and on page twelve, you have a breakdown here of different

316
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:04,448
funding sources. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that?

317
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:08,180
So you'll see on the breakdown on the housing sources,

318
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,796
sure. Everyone realizes that the majority of our dollars come

319
00:21:11,818 --> 00:21:15,716
from CDBG funding. That's our largest pot of the pie,

320
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:19,856
$25 million. And then you see Turs 12 million,

321
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,336
hopper is 10 million. And we can go on and

322
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:26,760
on. What you are presenting today

323
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,472
is just the general fund. That's all we're presenting today is a general

324
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:33,672
fund piece of the budget. And your follow up? Well,

325
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,952
Councilman Pollard, I understand those funding revenues,

326
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:40,504
but what concerns me is that ten years ago, their general fund budget

327
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:44,080
was almost $2.5 million. And it paid as our city

328
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,320
grows and as our housing prices skyrocket,

329
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,120
that our city budget is being reduced so drastically.

330
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,856
But the question I would have, and we can get this from the department and

331
00:21:57,878 --> 00:22:01,716
then get it back out to the public, is how much money were

332
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,104
we getting from outside sources as well to supplement?

333
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:09,152
If we were at 2.5 million before, what were we getting in CDBG?

334
00:22:09,216 --> 00:22:13,128
What were we getting in Turs? Dollars. Because that plays a role also

335
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:16,488
in, I think, how we allocate dollars from the general fund.

336
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:20,472
So if you can work on that, Director, to show

337
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:23,944
maybe ten years ago what was coming

338
00:22:23,982 --> 00:22:27,132
in from a funding standpoint from outside the city as

339
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:30,716
compared to now, sure, we can get that information to you. Now,

340
00:22:30,738 --> 00:22:34,224
I can tell you, I've been in the department for 30 years. When I first

341
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:37,616
got to the permanent CDBG, funding at that time for the

342
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:40,050
city was over $60 million.

343
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,340
But as they began to get additional municipalities

344
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,896
join the group, as the need grew

345
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:52,292
around the country, then the dollars, they're just

346
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:56,288
limited dollars. So the dollars start coming down council

347
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:59,700
Member Alcorn thank you, Chair. In other cities,

348
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,456
do they operate in the same way with most of the money coming

349
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:07,992
into their departments being from the federal sources? Our local

350
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:10,970
dollars are of course the Tours dollars are coming into it.

351
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,244
Or do other cities within Texas spend more

352
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:19,096
general fund money? They tend

353
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:22,508
to give their department a little bit more general fund dollars.

354
00:23:22,674 --> 00:23:26,144
We've seen cities outside of Texas who really do

355
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:29,264
give a larger contribution from

356
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:32,636
their general fund to the Housing department.

357
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,820
Philadelphia stands out, los Angeles

358
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,424
and a few others, I believe chicago, they tend to dedicate

359
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:45,270
more general fund dollar to the department. Thank you.

360
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,700
Council Member Thomas staff.

361
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,468
Hi. So Council

362
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:57,092
Member Thomas just wanted to express that we have an annual

363
00:23:57,156 --> 00:24:00,424
action plan that's outlined to support homelessness and

364
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:03,676
all federal allocations. And in response to your question,

365
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:07,096
the reduction of general fund money is because positions and programs

366
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:10,270
were attached to federal money to leave the general fund.

367
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,792
So that's her note. Thank you. Okay,

368
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:19,280
I appreciate you all's time. Sakunda Joseph.

369
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,164
Hello, I'm Sakonda Joseph. Like wakanda.

370
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:29,940
But thank you for your presentation.

371
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,124
I had other questions, but I just think it's an opportunity to make

372
00:24:35,162 --> 00:24:38,884
a statement is that I do want the council members here to know,

373
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:42,664
which I know that you do that right now, the city of Houston is number

374
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:46,164
one in evictions, number two in folks

375
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:49,832
not having access to affordable housing. Many people who came,

376
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:53,500
a few people who had came here earlier today were people who missed work,

377
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,900
left early. Some people couldn't come because of work because

378
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,676
they are in trouble. I get calls on my own phone

379
00:25:01,858 --> 00:25:05,260
about the evictions, and since February,

380
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,920
I've been so stressed just as a human being here,

381
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,296
living in this city that care about the people that are in

382
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:16,896
this city, until I'm trying to figure out what it is that we

383
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:19,796
can do to do better. So I don't want you all to look over what

384
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,524
was said. If there's opportunity to if the budget has

385
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:27,540
decreased over ten years, for what this?

386
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,384
For what we can do, right? We understand. The federal stuff

387
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:35,096
aside, I really hope that folks that are elected by

388
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:38,472
the people take the time out, because I'm taking my time

389
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:41,896
out to think about what we can do to increase

390
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:46,124
the budget to make sure that a lot of our citizens are

391
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:49,870
housed and have a safe place to say thank you. Thank you.

392
00:25:51,280 --> 00:26:08,376
Carrie Colleague I

393
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:11,816
just want to thank you for your presentation and

394
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:15,400
I'm just going to read my question. According to the Kinder Institute,

395
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,996
evictions cost Harris County over 240,000,000 a

396
00:26:20,018 --> 00:26:23,336
year prior to the economic impacts of COVID-19.

397
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:26,988
Harris county and the city of Houston are not direct

398
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:31,212
comparisons, but there is a lot of overlap.

399
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:35,056
And I want to know what does your department propose as solutions to

400
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:39,280
address Houston's eviction crisis

401
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,652
similar to what Sakanda said, we have a lot of people that are being

402
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:50,404
evicted. And I know that you stated that you

403
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,728
need more funds. So my

404
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:59,880
ask is that City council would propose

405
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,172
redistributing some of those funds to specifically

406
00:27:05,236 --> 00:27:08,830
housing so that we can address that situation.

407
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,870
And then my second question would be okay,

408
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,124
finish your second question really quick. It's just about repairs

409
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:23,152
and just funding for single home repairs and

410
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:27,056
rebuild. We have a lot of people that, even after

411
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:31,680
Harvey, are still struggling to fix

412
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,764
their homes. And although there are some programs I

413
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:40,064
recently called as soon as a month ago, and my aunt

414
00:27:40,112 --> 00:27:43,584
specifically, they were told they had no funds in the city

415
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:46,170
to help rebuild her home.

416
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,232
Let me ask you your first question. In terms of the

417
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:58,056
dollars that came into the city to assist individuals

418
00:27:58,088 --> 00:28:01,390
who were going through the eviction process.

419
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,904
We were able to serve between it was a joint venture

420
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:08,884
between us and the county. We were able to provide assistance

421
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:13,472
to over 70,000 families and

422
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:18,368
put out nearly $400 million

423
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:21,410
in one year. We were able to do that,

424
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,428
but the need was so much greater. Correct.

425
00:28:25,514 --> 00:28:28,644
And we just did not

426
00:28:28,682 --> 00:28:32,292
have any more dollars. We put out all the dollars

427
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:36,356
that we had and the dollars that came in remaining

428
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:40,164
that we got from areas

429
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:43,716
that did not spend those dollars. We put that for individuals

430
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:46,410
who were in eviction as we speak.

431
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,764
So we eliminated rental assistance and

432
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:54,076
went directly to individuals who were in the

433
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:57,816
process of going through eviction as we speak. So that's

434
00:28:57,848 --> 00:29:01,232
where those dollars are, but we just don't have any

435
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:04,460
additional now we've asked for additional funding.

436
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,856
That funding just has not arrived. Thank you.

437
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:11,780
And her second question, the second part of your question. When it comes to repair,

438
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,844
again, the dollars are limited. We can only do what

439
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:21,670
we can. It is a very difficult

440
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,556
product in dealing with home repair.

441
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:29,240
As I mentioned earlier, one of the major issues

442
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,584
with dealing with home repair are the individuals who cannot prove that they

443
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:36,152
are the owner. We have our hands

444
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:39,496
tied with being able to provide assistance to individuals

445
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:43,020
who are renting. So it is a very challenging

446
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,132
process in getting those done. The difference between what we did

447
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:51,392
versus what the Glo did was the Glo takes

448
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:54,896
the list and if you're up next, if you're ready to go,

449
00:29:54,998 --> 00:29:58,432
then you get service. But if you're not

450
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:01,776
ready to go, if you don't have title and you

451
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:05,408
don't have all your ducks lined up in a row

452
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:09,076
ready to receive assistance, then they move on. What the

453
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,270
City of Houston approach is,

454
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,244
we try not to leave anyone behind. So we have volunteer

455
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:20,040
lawyers. We try to put everyone

456
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,368
into a process that allows them to get

457
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,804
a complete service. Not just are you ready

458
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:30,316
to be served? If you don't comply today,

459
00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:34,236
then you just miss out. We're really trying to do everything we

460
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:37,544
can to not leave anyone behind that becomes

461
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:41,900
very challenging and it does become very time consuming.

462
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,330
And we're doing that with limited dollars. Thank you.

463
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,680
Julia ardua.

464
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,266
Thank you, sir, for your presentation. I also want to say I stand in

465
00:31:07,288 --> 00:31:10,770
solidarity with all five people that spoke before

466
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,580
me. I'd like to ask which council members

467
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:19,142
are supportive of an amendment during

468
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:23,910
this cycle to allocate more general funds to housing?

469
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,094
I think that's really important then to you,

470
00:31:29,132 --> 00:31:32,774
sir. I'd like to ask, has the department examined eviction rights

471
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:36,646
to council programs as seen in other cities?

472
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:40,294
If so, what would be the cost to provide that legal

473
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:43,690
representation to histonians facing eviction?

474
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,880
Could you repeat that question? Yes, sir.

475
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,514
I'll take my mask up. Has the department

476
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:55,454
examined eviction rights to council programs as

477
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:58,660
seen in other cities? If so,

478
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,482
what would be the cost to provide that

479
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:06,370
legal representation to Houstonians facing eviction?

480
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,614
We have not looked at what other cities are doing, but we are

481
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:13,560
providing legal services to individuals now.

482
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,178
Okay. And is there a cost to those citizens?

483
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:21,626
There is no cost to those citizens. We're footing that cost.

484
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:26,010
Okay. Thank you, sir. Broderick Butler.

485
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:46,346
Director, thank you very much for your presentation. Again,

486
00:32:46,448 --> 00:32:50,170
I apologize that I'm not going to speak to you. I'm going to speak

487
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,486
through you again. We're in a situation of

488
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:57,738
calling a thing a thing. The city of Houston,

489
00:32:57,914 --> 00:33:01,950
and I won't say that it's in bad faith,

490
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,414
but I will call it disingenuous that outwardly

491
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:09,860
the city promotes housing as a

492
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,886
priority, as something to champion.

493
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:17,426
But when you look at the real where the rubber meets the

494
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:20,390
road, math is math.

495
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:26,454
So I don't know what to tell you other than that. So I

496
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:31,106
find it very disheartening that the

497
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:34,762
citizens of this city and those that are moving here

498
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:38,506
and those that live here and those that have come and told you what

499
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:39,980
the reality is.

500
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,366
I'm at a loss for words. And again, I don't use the

501
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:50,394
word bad faith or lack of good faith. I genuinely

502
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:53,310
use the word disingenuous.

503
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,318
You put your money where your mouth is. Your money is what your priorities

504
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:03,186
are. And I think that this

505
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,466
is just a bad deal. So that's all

506
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:07,940
I got to say about that.

507
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,950
Well, just one comment.

508
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,814
We are very understanding and we sympathize about

509
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:23,218
all of the issues. And we do understand it would

510
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:27,082
be great if we could help each and every individual that needs

511
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:31,110
assistance. There's a lot of people in this city that need assistance.

512
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,206
We just don't have the resources to do it.

513
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:38,062
Even if we got an abundance amount of money

514
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:42,078
from general fund, it still would not be enough

515
00:34:42,244 --> 00:34:45,726
to have a significant impact on all the

516
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:49,342
individuals in this city. And we are trying to do the best

517
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:52,674
we can by leveraging the dollars that we have in order

518
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:56,418
to have the greatest impact. Well. Thank you, Director. I think

519
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:59,634
I speak for all of us when we say that we understand that you all

520
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:03,334
are doing the best that you can with the resources that you have. The city

521
00:35:03,372 --> 00:35:06,738
of Houston has priorities all across the board, from solid

522
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:10,114
waste to public safety to housing to parks to libraries

523
00:35:10,162 --> 00:35:14,294
to airports to you name it. This is a city with over 2 million people

524
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:18,074
with a limited budget. If you have $5 billion and

525
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:21,146
you take from one department, you have to give to another. And so we're trying

526
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:24,550
to find ways in which to allocate dollars in a fair and equitable

527
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,710
manner, but also trying to make sure that we reach

528
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,338
the necessary needs of all Houstonians.

529
00:35:31,514 --> 00:35:35,454
There's those that may feel like we should put more money in housing and take

530
00:35:35,492 --> 00:35:37,390
more money away from a different department,

531
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,194
and then you have those who say that we need

532
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:45,902
more money in a different department to take away from another department.

533
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:49,134
So you're always going to have to have a balance. And that's

534
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:52,446
why you elect us to try to listen to your concerns,

535
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:55,382
which we do. And we thank all of you all for coming forward to present

536
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,630
those, but it's still a balance that we have to fit.

537
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,694
And I think your department does an excellent job of trying to

538
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:06,646
do the best you can with the dollars that you have. And I

539
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:09,560
want you all to know that directly from us as well.

540
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,506
There are no additional public speakers. This includes our housing

541
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:18,266
department workshop. We will now adjourn the housing department budget

542
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:18,570
workshop.
