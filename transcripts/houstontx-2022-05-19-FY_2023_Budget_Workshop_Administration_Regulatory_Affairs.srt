1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,100
It.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,300
Welcome, Director. And the floor is yours. Thank you.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,300
I feel really short. Okay.

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,446
I know. Good afternoon. I'm here to present the FY

5
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:27,126
23 budget proposal for the Administration and Regulatory

6
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:30,574
Affairs Department. With me is Val Barry, the CFO

7
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:34,180
for our department. Next slide, please.

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,022
Ara has 18 separate business units.

9
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,494
We're a composite of multiple functional areas

10
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,162
across the city that didn't fit into a single type of department.

11
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:49,990
And so we have this spread across ten divisions spread across

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,286
four different funds. And so we're here to talk about that today.

13
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:56,874
This slide shows our general fund division. We have

14
00:00:56,912 --> 00:01:00,554
several of our ads and our deputy director here.

15
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:04,298
The divisions are listed on this slide. The Director's office.

16
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:08,202
Obviously. Sustainability and Resilience, which is Deputy Director

17
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:11,674
Priya Zechariah, who is here? Franchise administration.

18
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:15,786
Valerie Barry, regulatory permitting. Catherine Bruning.

19
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:19,498
Payroll Services is Karen Davidson, who could not be here today because her husband's

20
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:23,374
in the hospital. Operations in three one one, which is Charles

21
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:27,330
Jackson, and Financial Services, which is also Valerie Berry.

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,762
One of the things that I want to note before we leave this slide is

23
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:34,886
I'd like you to draw your attention to the number that you

24
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:38,354
see before you as our proposed FY 23 budget

25
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:42,870
of 32.174 million, we round that to 32.2.

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,586
However, 10.8 million of that amount is the transfer to

27
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:50,602
the Bark Special Fund from the general fund. So our actual

28
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:54,122
budget for the general fund is $21.4 million.

29
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:57,814
Next slide, please. So the previous

30
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:00,794
slide showed you our general fund operations. This slide,

31
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:04,574
as well as the next three will represent the organization charts for the special

32
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:08,206
funds and the Central Services Revolving Fund that we manage. On this

33
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:11,682
slide, we show the budget and division breakout for the Park Houston Special

34
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:15,694
Fund. Park Houston is led by Maria Urshad

35
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:19,774
and they manage all of the city's on street parking inventory. Next slide,

36
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:23,266
please. Bark is

37
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:26,950
the city's animal shelter. It is funded through the Bark Special Revenue Fund.

38
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,902
And it's led by Greg Damienoff, assistant director, who is also here.

39
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:34,562
The Bark Operational Division includes six sections that administer

40
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:38,246
all of the programs and services that we provide for Houston's pets and pet

41
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,060
owners. Next slide, please.

42
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,762
The property and casualty fund is a revolving fund

43
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:48,586
where Ara's risk management division is funded. Risk Management is led

44
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:52,794
by Tina Paquette, Assistant Director who is also here today. Risk Management

45
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:56,346
handles all of the commercial insurance for the city of Houston. Next slide,

46
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:59,706
please. The Central

47
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:03,614
Services revolving fund is a chargeback fund. You've heard from many of the directors

48
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:07,634
here today that they run services through the revolving fund. We do

49
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:11,722
as well. There's no FTEs assigned to this because those are reflected

50
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:14,230
in other places throughout our budget.

51
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,510
But this is where the costs for the citywide mailroom, the citywide print shop,

52
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,898
citywide payroll services and employee transit are flowed

53
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:25,080
through. Next slide, please.

54
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,990
And these are the categories of service that Arie provides and the statutory

55
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,846
mandates that require us to provide those services. Next slide,

56
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,238
please. And these are the penalties for

57
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:40,794
failure to provide the mandated services. Because Ara

58
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:44,446
is primarily a regulatory department, the majority of our

59
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:48,446
services are mandated by either federal, state or local ordinances. And the

60
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:52,418
penalties for nondelvery of those services can be anything from

61
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:55,874
substantial financial penalties as they are for payroll to even

62
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:58,100
criminal penalties. Next slide, please.

63
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,634
This slide summarizes our general fund revenues as

64
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:06,902
well as our special fund revenues. As you can see,

65
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:10,294
our estimated General Fund revenues for FY 23 will

66
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:13,734
be down by $1.9 million compared to year

67
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:16,946
end FY 22, primarily due to franchise

68
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,890
fee decreases. As you can see from this slide, the biggest single

69
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,346
loss will be telephone franchise fees. And these will continue to

70
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:27,674
drop every year because they're based on the number of landlines in

71
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:30,698
Houston. And most of us don't use landlines anymore.

72
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:34,794
We also had a drop in our permitting revenues. This is mainly from alcohol

73
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,946
licenses and taxicab permits. One bright

74
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,290
spot in our revenue picture, even though it's small, is a source of

75
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,590
revenues called Das facilities or network nodes.

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,514
With the expansion of 5G, this source of revenue is actually

77
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:52,034
going up. It produces currently about $2 million a year. There is

78
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:56,246
a 52% growth in this that's projected for FY 23.

79
00:04:56,428 --> 00:05:00,326
We also administer two special funds the Bark Special Revenue and

80
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:03,666
the Park Houston Special Revenue Fund. As you can see, we don't

81
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:08,106
expect much growth in the Bark Special Revenue Fund. This is primarily not an

82
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:11,514
area that produces revenues. The little bit that we do produce is

83
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:15,642
in adoption fees, license fees and wellness services. And because

84
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:19,114
it is so hard to find veterinarians these days, we had another

85
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,350
resignation today. It is very difficult to provide these services.

86
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,622
So our revenues are not expected to come back up in FY 23 for

87
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,758
parking. However, we do have a better story.

88
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:33,026
Post pandemic. Houstonians are getting back out. They're starting to

89
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:36,734
park in all of our inner city areas and they're using parking meters.

90
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:40,754
So this year they're projected to increase by about 7% or 1.3

91
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:44,626
million. We're also projecting increases in the

92
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:47,846
revolving funds. Now remember, these are not revenues. These are just paying back

93
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:51,942
the general Fund for costs. So what you see there in the $1.7

94
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:55,974
million increase from FY 22 to FY 23 is the

95
00:05:56,012 --> 00:06:00,166
10% increase in the property insurance premiums for the City of Houston. Next slide,

96
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:03,766
please. On the previous slide,

97
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:07,146
I showed you all of the individual categories of general fund revenues and

98
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:10,378
the anticipated decline for FY 23. So I won't go into a

99
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:13,694
lot of detail on this one because this just provides the narrative for everything

100
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:16,942
that I just said. But I do want to highlight three things. First is

101
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:20,526
electricity Revenues CenterPoint remains the highest source of revenues to

102
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:23,906
the City of Houston, paying us $95 million a year for the use of our

103
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:27,506
streets. Telephone franchise fees are the second highest fee that

104
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:30,894
we collect. And as I said, this is a rapidly disappearing

105
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:34,434
source of franchise fees. At one point it was $60 million. It's down

106
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:37,906
to $17 million. We can count on that decreasing every budget

107
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:41,366
year when I'm here. And cable TV franchise fees also

108
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:45,550
are disappearing because many of us are using Netflix and Hulu and prime, and we're

109
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,254
not using cable TV anymore. So that is also a rapidly disappearing

110
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:53,050
source of revenue. So the takeaway from this slide is that

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,294
between decreasing telephone and cable franchise fees,

112
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:59,818
you're losing almost $30 million. And that accounts

113
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:03,198
for $30 million in the general fund budget. Next year. You can expect that to

114
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:04,080
be much lower.

115
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,702
The next slide, please. On this slide we talk about

116
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:14,258
more detail related to revenues. Permanent and license revenues, as I

117
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:17,966
said, had gone down because alcohol establishments were closed during the pandemic.

118
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:21,342
And that's where we get many of our fees as well as taxicab permits.

119
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:24,770
Taxicabs had already been decimated by the TNCs.

120
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,790
This pretty effectively eliminated the industry.

121
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,226
And as always, we do attempt to offset our revenue

122
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:35,414
losses through aggressive auditing and aggressive compliance

123
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:39,034
efforts. This year, we expect to collect $300,000 in

124
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:42,374
delinquent revenues just based on those audits.

125
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:46,422
Next slide, please. And just as I showed

126
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:50,498
all of the funds that we administer on the revenue slide, this slide summarizes

127
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:54,026
the expenditures for all of the funds that are administered by Ara.

128
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:57,546
I highlighted in yellow the row with the general fund expenditures

129
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:01,102
since I know that's what you're most interested in. And in a few minutes,

130
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:04,894
when we get to the net change slide, I'll actually walk you through in detailed

131
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:08,386
that revenue increase of 1.34 million. But for now,

132
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,474
we're going to talk about the special funds. First up is Park Houston.

133
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:15,750
The increase in expenditures that you see here is

134
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,446
based on two sources. The first is the addition of FTEs for

135
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:22,882
a new planned fourth shift for compliance.

136
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:26,546
The second is an increase in the transfer of revenue

137
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:29,878
to the general fund. As I said before, we didn't

138
00:08:29,894 --> 00:08:33,194
have people parking during the pandemic, so the transfer to the general fund was much

139
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:36,698
smaller. For FY 23, we were projecting to transfer

140
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:40,042
$5.5 million from the parking special revenue fund

141
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:43,646
to the general fund, an increase of $2 million over what we were able

142
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:47,518
to do this year. The next special fund is Bark. Bark is the

143
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:51,390
opposite of park. Houston. Rather than transferring money to the general fund,

144
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,074
bark receives money from the general fund. For FY 23,

145
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:58,546
they'll be receiving 10.8 million. For FY 22, it was

146
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:02,578
10.5 million. And finally, in the property casualty fund,

147
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:06,274
you see the increase there. Again, that's an increase in both revenues and expenditures.

148
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:08,920
It's a flow through fund. Next slide, please.

149
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,182
And this is the graphical representation of the proposed FY 23 general

150
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:17,766
fund budget. As you can see, the biggest pieces of this budget are

151
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:21,274
personnel, which is 54% of the budget, or 17.3

152
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:24,886
million. The second biggest piece is the $10.8 million

153
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:29,066
transfer to BARC which is 34% of our total expenditure budget. And then

154
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:33,066
finally, the restricted accounts represent more than half of the 12% that remains

155
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:37,134
of Ara's General Fund expenditure budget. So only 1.6%

156
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:40,714
of our total $32.2 million FY 23 proposed

157
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:44,894
budget is what you might call discretionary meaning that it's not already obligated

158
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:49,378
to personnel or some sort of contractual or mandated obligation but it's available

159
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,020
for supplies and services. Next slide, please.

160
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,374
This is the same breakdown for the Bark Special Revenue Fund.

161
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:59,910
Bark's proposed budget is what? 13.3 million.

162
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,950
And as I said before, the lion's share of that is the $10.8 million

163
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,946
transfer from the General Fund in Bark. 67% is

164
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:10,460
personnel expenses. Next slide piece.

165
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,180
And this is the breakdown for the park houston Special Revenue Fund.

166
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,822
Personnel is 34% of the expenditures of this special revenue fund.

167
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:23,840
The other big piece of this is 26% which is the transfer

168
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,626
from the Park Houston Special Revenue Fund to the General Fund. Next slide,

169
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:31,034
please. And this is the breakdown

170
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:34,338
for Ara's portion of the Property Casualty Service Fund.

171
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:37,746
Again, this is where our risk management group is funded. You'll notice that

172
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:41,266
only 3% of this fund goes to pay

173
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:44,646
for personnel. 97% is insurance premiums for the City

174
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:46,600
of Houston. Next slide, please.

175
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,566
This is the more complicated slide. There's five blocks here

176
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:55,786
and we're going to walk through those as quickly as we can while giving you

177
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:59,206
the detail. Our current budget is broken

178
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:03,034
out. At the top block, you'll see $17.75 million.

179
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:06,746
That's our actual FY 22 operating budget. These are

180
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:10,110
the funds that are available for the General Fund operations of our department.

181
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,622
Added to that amount is the restricted accounts, totally 2.48

182
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:18,334
million. And then the General Fund transfer to Bark, which is 10.5

183
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:22,058
million in FY 22. So if you add the restricted items

184
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:25,158
for FY 22 plus the transfer to Bark,

185
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:28,994
which was 10.5 the total operating budget that was not available to

186
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:32,974
Ara and FY 22 was $12.6 million leaving

187
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:36,150
only the 17.74 million for our operations.

188
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,726
The next block is called Adjustments to FY 22 budget. These are

189
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:44,386
the amounts that were added or taken out of our budget during the current fiscal

190
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:47,894
year. And so you have things like the contractual hope,

191
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:51,514
municipal pay raises and the amount of $283,000 for the General

192
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:55,366
Fund and $161,000 for Bark. A restricted

193
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:58,080
accounts adjustment of $71,000.

194
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,314
$21,000 received from Council member Cisneros's Budget Surplus

195
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:05,786
Fund to fund spay neuter efforts for Bark.

196
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:09,434
A $17,000 adjustment for scanning services related

197
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:13,030
to the records retention project at the City Secretary's office which Ara

198
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,258
is managing. And then the last item in the second block is a

199
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:19,714
$117,000 increase for Bark shelter, cleaning and

200
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:22,722
a rescue initiative. Those are explained in footnote three.

201
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:26,582
Altogether, these items yield a net increase from our FY 22

202
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:30,134
budget of $527,000 bringing the

203
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,814
FY 222 year end adjusted budget to $30.83

204
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:37,830
million. And then in the next section, you see the operating budget

205
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,786
adjustments that get us to FY 23. These are the amounts that

206
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:45,066
are added to or reduced from the FY 22 budget to

207
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:48,678
get us here. So the $21,000.01 time receipt from Council

208
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:52,046
Member Cisneros from her budget surplus would be subtracted out

209
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:56,702
in FY 23. You'll also see $216,000

210
00:12:56,756 --> 00:13:00,218
of onetime funds from an FY 22 budget amendment, and the details

211
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:03,346
of those are spelled out in footnote five. And then in the

212
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:06,814
third block, you also see $328,000 being added

213
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:10,366
to fund various one time programs, including the three one one hiring

214
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:14,066
initiative. And then the details for the $328,000 are

215
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:17,026
laid out for you in footnote four. And I'll also go through those in just

216
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:20,066
a second on the next slide. So when you net out the reductions and the

217
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:23,522
increases in that third block, we end up with a $91,000

218
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:26,838
net increase to Ara's budget for specific programs

219
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:30,074
for FY 23. Continuing down the page, we're now

220
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:33,686
to the fourth block. You see our contractual or mandated adjustments,

221
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,954
and this includes the increases for health benefits, hope,

222
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:40,266
contractual pay raises, municipal pension costs and restricted

223
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:44,270
accounts. The total is an increase of $1.25 million

224
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,898
to the Ara budget. And finally, in the fifth block,

225
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:52,254
we arrive at the proposed FY 23 budget of 32.174

226
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,486
million. And as you can see, the Ara General Fund budget

227
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:58,930
is increasing by 1.34 million. But of that amount,

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,206
only $91,000 is an actual increase to our operating

229
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:05,398
budget. Everything else is a contractual or mandated amount.

230
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:08,854
At the bottom block, you have the page that contains the footnotes that detail every

231
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:11,480
adjustment I just discussed. Next slide, please.

232
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,566
And then this slide summarizes the big picture expenditure changes that we discussed

233
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:20,106
on the previous slide for the General Fund, as well as the highlights of

234
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:23,626
our special fund expenditures. So in

235
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:27,046
addition to the increases for health benefits, pension contribution and municipal

236
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:30,050
employee contractual pay increases across all funds,

237
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,678
let me reiterate into the general fund the adjustments that are being made are

238
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:38,026
the $36,000 in one time funding. For the City Secretary records

239
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:41,646
retention project, the $20,991 in

240
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:44,946
funding for a hiring incentive to recruit and retain new

241
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:49,234
three one one agents and $224,861

242
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:52,722
in resilience funding transferred from the Planning Department to

243
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:55,526
Ara for the Resilience and Sustainability Office.

244
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,446
For the Bark Special Fund, we received $256,000 for

245
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:02,902
a shelter cleaning contract, $30,000 for a

246
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,610
rescue incentive program,

247
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,910
$39,000 for the Pep Microchipping Initiative,

248
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,486
and then a reduction of FY 22 non

249
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:14,586
recurring program adjustments of $563,000.

250
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:17,734
And finally, for Park Houston,

251
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:21,838
we received program adjustments funding for ten additional employees to

252
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:25,326
add a fourth shift of compliance officers. And we realized after we

253
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:28,522
published this slide that there is an error on the Park Houston bullet.

254
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,066
The amount for the fourth shift is $280,000, and the

255
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:35,282
slide shows $256,402.

256
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:39,134
Next slide, please. This concludes our budget

257
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:43,246
presentation please note that our restricted accounts details, organization charts,

258
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:46,726
demographics and other relevant materials are included as appendices to

259
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:50,358
this presentation, including the top three one one service requests for

260
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:53,350
each one of your council districts. Thank you for your attention.

261
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,450
Thank you, Director.

262
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,378
So, just forward thinking some of your

263
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,850
revenue sources, like cable and television.

264
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,234
We're seeing reduced revenues coming in because

265
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:11,790
of less usage. So thinking

266
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,006
about the future, what are some creative ideas or ways in which you

267
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:18,426
think we can generate more revenue? Is there anything in the pipeline

268
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:22,202
maybe discussed at the state level that you can see that would generate

269
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:25,618
more revenue through fees? So at the state level,

270
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:29,074
they have continued to erode our fees. For example, when they took away

271
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:32,146
TNCs, that would have been a $70 million revenue by now.

272
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:35,842
Network nodes by now would have been $40

273
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:39,078
million revenue. But that was also decimated at the state level.

274
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,326
It's still a growing revenue, but by no means the size that it would have

275
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:45,986
been. And so what the mayor charged us with was finding

276
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:48,982
anything in the right of way that we were not charging fees for already,

277
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:52,170
because again, it belongs to the public and the public should be reimbursed for it.

278
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,154
And that's what we've tasked our group to do. We're speaking to public works about

279
00:16:56,272 --> 00:17:00,106
what things that they are charging permitting fees for that should actually be rental

280
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:03,870
because the city charter does call for uses in the right of way to

281
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,094
be reimbursed as rental rather than permit fees. Thank you,

282
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:11,546
Council Member Amy Pick. Thank you, Vice Chair.

283
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:14,994
And thank you, Director, for the presentation. Can you talk a little bit

284
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:18,818
more about three one one and anything that might be in the budget to

285
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,526
fix the three one one app and the three one system this next fiscal

286
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,182
year? I'm very glad you brought that up because we

287
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:29,366
are completely expecting that by the end of the year we'll have

288
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:32,534
a new app. When we rolled out the new three one

289
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:35,814
one system, we were excited about it because it has all kinds of really cool

290
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:39,546
functionality if you're at your desktop. And we thought that what

291
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:43,514
most people wanted, based on the customer feedback that we'd gotten, was to be able

292
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,954
to figure out what the status of their service request was. That was the single

293
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:50,918
biggest complaint we got under the old system. And when you use the old app,

294
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:54,734
it changed the number of your service request. By the time you got

295
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:57,934
to the actual system and went into the web to check it,

296
00:17:57,972 --> 00:18:00,782
everybody was angry about that. So we thought what we're going to do instead is

297
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:04,698
optimize the desktop app for mobile and then everyone will

298
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:08,098
have all the information they want. And what we didn't realize was that what customers

299
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:11,838
also wanted to do was take pictures and be able to drop a GIS pin.

300
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:15,746
So the new app is going to have the best features of

301
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:18,934
all of that. We're going back to Cclick Fix, which was the app we used

302
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,802
before, but we're enhancing it now so that it has a lot of the neat

303
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:25,926
functional features that we added to the desktop app.

304
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:29,526
And it will also include the neat things about picture taking in GIS.

305
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,842
And that will be out before the end of the year. So how much money

306
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:36,346
did we spend on going to this new three one one app?

307
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:39,926
And are we just out that money that we spent transferring over

308
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:43,834
and then going back? So the new app was actually in the original development

309
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:46,880
cost of the whole system. It wasn't a separate cost.

310
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,446
It actually was not something that was very hard for Accenture to do because all

311
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:54,498
that they did was optimize the desktop app. So that wasn't a

312
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:58,066
cost. And it's not a matter of recouping that there is a cost to the

313
00:18:58,088 --> 00:19:01,918
new app that's coming up and there will be a new contract that Hits will

314
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:05,062
actually be bringing to you to approve and vet. Okay,

315
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:09,190
thank you. Council member Abby Cayman.

316
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,462
Hi, Director. First off, to all

317
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:17,510
of your divisions. I don't know how Ara encompasses

318
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,786
so much. It's truly extraordinary. But my

319
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:25,274
staff just did a tour of three one one, and I cannot thank

320
00:19:25,312 --> 00:19:28,874
the operators enough there. The retention, the knowledge

321
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:32,366
that they have is extraordinary. Bark I

322
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:35,710
know that times have been really challenging. I think you just mentioned we

323
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,270
just lost another veterinarian.

324
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,222
What are we trying to do to recruit right now other than financial

325
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:48,450
incentives for veterinarians? I know that has been an issue even

326
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,974
before coming into office, and I know I even talked to veterinarian

327
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:56,018
offices around the city, or at least in my district.

328
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,654
Same thing. It's hard right now. What else are we looking

329
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:03,426
at in terms of that right now? It's a national shortage.

330
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:07,146
So what we used to do was regularly just go around the country and

331
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:10,934
poach. And now most veterinarians who are graduating

332
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:14,586
do not want to do shelter medicine. If they're going to do

333
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:17,546
veterinary medicine at all, they want to work in a private practice where they get

334
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:22,258
to use the cool new technology and do a lot of diagnostics spaying

335
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:25,518
and neutering. Not the most fun thing to do. So it's hard.

336
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,526
One of the things that we'd like to do is start an internship program with

337
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:32,400
one of the universities, and Council member Cisnero's led an effort toward that.

338
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,806
We haven't gotten much traction with A and M, honestly,

339
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:39,218
but now we're looking at going national with any other vet school that's willing to

340
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:42,578
partner with us. And we would find a way to pay for their interns that

341
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:46,326
come here, even if it's through private funding. But we're working with best friends and

342
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:50,034
some of our other partners locally to try to troubleshoot that. And I appreciate

343
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,526
the partnership with outside organizations. I also wanted to give

344
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:55,110
a huge shout out to parking.

345
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,250
Incredible job, especially dealing with a lot of the challenges that we face

346
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,630
inside the District and obviously the Office of Resiliency and Sustainability,

347
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,982
that's going to be monumental and historic work that's taking place

348
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:11,118
there. Two quick questions. Three quick questions.

349
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:14,558
One, scanning for all of

350
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,934
our records and archiving, is that really happening? That's really

351
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:21,422
happening. The mayor asked us last

352
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:24,126
year or the year before to go over to city secretary's office and at least

353
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:27,026
start boxing everything up to get it organized. And we did that, and she has

354
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:30,466
been so welcoming to us and working with us on that. And then he gave

355
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:33,746
us money to start the scanning project. We're actually working with the

356
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:37,170
state of Texas. They have someone who archives all of their records,

357
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,614
and we're sending up 100 boxes at a time to get them scanned and

358
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:44,274
make them searchable. Because remember, there's no point in having them just be PDFs.

359
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:47,750
They need to be searchable PDFs. Okay. And do we have a timeline,

360
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,466
estimated timeline for completion on that? The mayor wants it done

361
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,278
before he leaves. Okay, understood.

362
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,380
Can I be placed back in queue, please?

363
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,440
You're back in the queue now. All right,

364
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,018
director, one thing I wanted to bring up, and I'm

365
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,414
happy to talk offline about it, but last year council did

366
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:14,290
pass an amendment that I drafted related to and first off,

367
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,970
thank you to the department for all of the work on the sound ordinance changes

368
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,110
thus far. Sally is like, yes, huge victory.

369
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,542
There was one other thing we had asked the department to look at, which is

370
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:29,286
weekend hours as it relates to construction. Right now,

371
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:32,178
there's no distinction between weekday and weekends.

372
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:35,938
We're getting construction 07:00 a.m. Saturdays and Sundays,

373
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,930
and residents need a reprieve.

374
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,506
Again, we had set a timeline for the end of this fiscal year,

375
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,914
and I know it's coming up, so I just wanted to check on

376
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:50,234
the status of that. If you all are ready to proceed with stakeholder meetings

377
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:53,342
on that and what we can do. We have

378
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:56,958
not even begun that the changes to the noise ordinance that we made

379
00:22:57,044 --> 00:23:00,650
took so much longer than anyone anticipated they were going to make with stakeholders

380
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,582
that we put this on the back burner because, remember, it was a whole different

381
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:07,106
group of stakeholders than restaurants and everyone else. So that's something I have

382
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:09,874
to circle back with with the mayor and ask him if we can now start

383
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:13,678
having those stakeholder meetings for that. Okay. If we could talk offline about that

384
00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:17,026
and just come up with kind of a plan of attack, our residents

385
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:21,266
would really appreciate it. And then lastly, you've addressed

386
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:24,822
a lot of needs. Is there anything else that you want to mention

387
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:28,138
to us that we need to be aware of in terms of upcoming needs in

388
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:31,642
the foreseeable future, given how tight this budget is?

389
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:34,954
So you've been asking every department that question.

390
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:38,074
So we thought a lot about it. And the mayor has been very good about

391
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:41,498
giving one time money where it was needed. For example, for our hiring initiative for

392
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,926
three one one. By the way, our turnaround time right now, our average speed of

393
00:23:44,948 --> 00:23:48,126
Anderson for three one one is consistently less than a minute. So you should be

394
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:51,326
very happy to hear that. But our biggest need is

395
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:54,862
embark. We can't keep people, we can't hire people. We consistently

396
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:57,986
have between a 20% to 35% vacancy in

397
00:23:58,008 --> 00:24:01,406
that division. And it's not even an animal enforcement officers,

398
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:04,366
believe it or not. We can keep those. It's the people who clean the shelter

399
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:08,130
every day. So the mayor said, well, okay, if we don't have enough people to

400
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,490
keep the shelter clean and then also be able to feed and water

401
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,906
and treat the animals, let's get a cleaning contract in there and get some

402
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:18,058
contractors in to clean it to free up the employees. We did that and you

403
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:21,034
see the money here for it. The first week they showed up,

404
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:23,786
they came with four people and three of them left and said, this is not

405
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,450
my gig. I'm not doing this. So we're still troubleshooting that,

406
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,900
but our single biggest need is people.

407
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,134
Understood? Thank you. And again, thank you to the there's a lot of people back

408
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:38,320
there. Thank you all for everything that you do.

409
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,546
Yeah, you want to have your team stand up in the back so we can

410
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,100
say hello and thank you.

411
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,740
Thank you all for everything that you do.

412
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,106
We know you make the most out of a little and we appreciate all

413
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:58,534
your efforts, all the engagement with our offices and look forward

414
00:24:58,572 --> 00:25:01,058
to working with you in the days ahead. So thank you, Director and Ms.

415
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:04,146
Barry for your presentation. And you are dismissed. Thank you,

416
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:08,250
sir. We'll now move to the public comment period.

417
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,194
We'll start with the virtual public speakers. Please press star six to

418
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:16,986
unmute when you hear your name. First name is Amanda

419
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:17,600
she.

420
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,450
Hello. Thank you.

421
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,064
Does Ara or any other department do analysis on

422
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:31,984
the three one one calls to identify broad or persistent

423
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,940
gaps in service delivery?

424
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,036
That's a great question. I would like to know the answer to

425
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:44,276
that myself. We will respond to that question

426
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,736
within 48 hours. So if you want to, please send that over to

427
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:51,016
District E at houstontx Gov, we'll get a

428
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,536
response for you. Do you

429
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,350
have any other questions, Ms. She?

430
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,260
No, I do not. Thank you. Thank you. Saba Blanding.

431
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,524
Hi. I know staff has already been discussed.

432
00:26:08,572 --> 00:26:13,004
I was just curious if there were any additional financial resources Bark

433
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:16,240
needed to address Houston's stray population.

434
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,076
I'm sure additional resources are greatly needed and appreciated.

435
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:25,492
Many of our offices use our council district service funds to also

436
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:28,976
put through projects to work with Bark and Houston Humane Society for spay

437
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:32,436
and neuter programs. So if you want to reach out to

438
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:36,180
your district council member on ways in which to understand

439
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,116
the money that they may be allocating or any of the eleven district council

440
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:44,072
members. We'll be able to provide that information to you. But pretty regularly around

441
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:47,672
the city of Houston, the District council members are putting forth

442
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:52,124
spay and neuter programs for the public to take

443
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:56,430
notice of and be a part of. Thank you.

444
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
You're welcome. Jason Oliver.

445
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,740
My first question follows up on Amanda.

446
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,960
I definitely am interested in the three one one analysis.

447
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,264
I'd also like to know about what other performance measures Ara

448
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:16,676
has for three one one call. Answering time is

449
00:27:16,698 --> 00:27:20,292
important and as it shows, there's major

450
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:23,896
room for improvement. But I'd also like to know just see more

451
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:27,432
metrics around the service, around service delivery. And then

452
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:31,156
second harkening

453
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:35,124
back to fleet management metrics. The city consistently uses

454
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:39,272
around 10 million gallons of fuel every year. Where does fuel reduction

455
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:42,876
show up in the city's sustainability plans? And how are we doing

456
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:44,030
with that?

457
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,224
Council Member David Robinson. Mr. Oliver, another great question from

458
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:52,844
you about our fuel goals.

459
00:27:52,892 --> 00:27:56,128
That the reduction of our

460
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:59,968
reliance on both petroleum gas products

461
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:03,396
is in both our Climate Action Plan as

462
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:06,596
well as the Resilient Houston plan. The exact section and

463
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,856
reference and goals are outlined

464
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:13,590
in that. So I again commend you for the good question.

465
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,780
We can help you locate that if you're unaware of that or otherwise

466
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,196
get an update for you about the current status of attaining

467
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:25,210
those goals. Thanks for the question.

468
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,950
Thank you. I'll check the reports and see what we've got.

469
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,096
There are no additional public speakers. And this concludes our Administrative and Regulatory

470
00:28:35,128 --> 00:28:38,912
Affairs budget workshop. We will now move to begin

471
00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:42,320
our budget workshop for municipal courts.

472
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,224
I believe that we had other speakers in the audience who

473
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:51,910
signed up. They were on the list emailed to us.

474
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,020
Good catch.

475
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,544
Our first in person public speaker is Meredith

476
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:03,060
Powell. Meredith Powell.

477
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,480
Luckily, Amy recognizes me.

478
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,930
Thank you. Ms. Powell, the floor is yours. Thank you. Good afternoon,

479
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,034
council members. My name is Meredith Powell. I live in district a

480
00:29:22,232 --> 00:29:25,918
by profession. I'm a communications and community relations consultant.

481
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:29,486
I'm also the president of my neighborhood association, so Council member Peck

482
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,506
and her staff hear from me regularly. I'm very

483
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:37,298
passionate about animal welfare issues and I recognize the

484
00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:40,566
role for Bark. I'm not one of those people who's like Bark is bad and

485
00:29:40,588 --> 00:29:43,670
all of that kind of stuff. I'm here to encourage you all,

486
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,100
whether it is within your own districts or

487
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,930
as a council, to increase resources as much as possible for Bark.

488
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,518
Because thousands

489
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:59,734
of animals live on the street and need rescuing. And while there are many rescue

490
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:03,694
groups and street rescuers like myself, we can only do so much.

491
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:07,246
I work with Rpm and straight out of Texas to transport animals as

492
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:10,846
much as possible. But I encourage you to give as many resources to

493
00:30:10,868 --> 00:30:14,242
Bark. Because if we don't give resources to Bark and animal. Control.

494
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:17,634
It just exacerbates the problem that we're having because we have

495
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:20,494
stray animals on the street that are not fixed.

496
00:30:20,622 --> 00:30:24,420
And it's just creating even more of a population that we're dealing with.

497
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,722
So one of the things I wanted to raise

498
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:32,150
is when we do the transport rescues, many of the people in other states

499
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,606
ask, what is the problem with Houston? What is the city doing about it?

500
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,242
And it makes us look really bad. I mean, Houston's leader in energy,

501
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:42,410
space exploration, health care, all of these different things.

502
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,426
Yet we get questions about what is the leadership position that

503
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:49,340
Houston is taking to deal with the animal welfare issues.

504
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,854
So I know we're working on microchip laws and I applaud city

505
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:56,970
council and the city of doing those kind of things and stray and neuter efforts.

506
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,154
I just encourage you to continue to provide resources to Bark

507
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:03,620
to address our city's ongoing animal issue.

508
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,646
Thank you. Are there some specific areas within Bark

509
00:31:07,678 --> 00:31:11,010
that you think the dollars would be most best utilized for?

510
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,170
I mean, sometimes I see programs that I don't think make sense. I understand

511
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,966
when we want to offer adoptions at low rates, but we

512
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:23,074
also have to ensure that people who adopt at lower cost have the resources

513
00:31:23,122 --> 00:31:27,130
to pay for the animals, because then what happens is animal turnins or

514
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,130
they release them as strays. So that's an issue. I think there's

515
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,438
an opportunity for better public private partnership.

516
00:31:34,534 --> 00:31:38,406
We do so much with our theater district and sports and all of these areas

517
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:42,558
where we have these huge companies who are supporting our efforts within the city.

518
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:46,026
We don't really see that within Bark and animal control. I think that that's

519
00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:49,130
an opportunity. Great suggestion.

520
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,510
Council member Amy Peck. Thank you, Meredith, for speaking

521
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,186
today. And I just wanted to thank you for all the work that you do,

522
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,510
especially in District A, when it comes to the animal population.

523
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,886
She is constantly out there rescuing

524
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:04,914
stray pets and doing so much work. So I just wanted to thank you for

525
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:09,030
that and for coming today. Thank you. Council Member Abby Cayman

526
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,074
I also just wanted to thank you for your efforts with Rescued Pets movement.

527
00:32:13,122 --> 00:32:16,726
I know we've partnered in our office with them in the efforts.

528
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:20,938
My mom's even volunteering now. Really just amazing

529
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:25,158
and beautiful work. I think your point about public private partnerships

530
00:32:25,254 --> 00:32:29,626
is dead on. And even including I

531
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,986
was thinking, especially with the veterinarian shortage, how do we tap

532
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:36,766
into the vet services that we already have in the city and that infrastructure and

533
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,058
getting volunteers and things like that. So all that's

534
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:43,546
to say, thank you. I really appreciate it. And I know Council

535
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:47,070
Member Peck really respects and appreciates all the work that you do in the district.

536
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,958
Thank you. And I encourage you to continue to reach out to Council

537
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:54,138
Member Peck and any of us if you have any specific ideas.

538
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:58,246
I know as the presentation was stated, that the mayor has

539
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,670
a commitment to sometimes put one time funding sources towards

540
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,746
specific needs with bark. And they still sometimes have challenges

541
00:33:05,938 --> 00:33:09,930
with recruitment, with retaining and with getting some of the services done.

542
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,306
But any ideas? A person like yourself who has vast experience

543
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,030
and understanding of the infrastructure of that entity

544
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,060
would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much. You're welcome.

545
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,786
Are there any in person public speakers who

546
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,020
would like to come forward?

547
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,196
Well, now, this concludes our Administrative and Regulatory Affairs

548
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:36,820
budget workshop.
