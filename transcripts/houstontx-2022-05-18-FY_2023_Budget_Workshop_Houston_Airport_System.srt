All departments have been directed to provide written responses within

11
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,230
48 hours of the conclusion

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,594
of their presentation. To any questions posted by council members on

13
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:49,334
SharePoint, the Budget Workshop schedule is posted on the BFA

14
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,674
website. Questions from council members can be uploaded at any time during the budget workshop

15
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,526
process. Of course, the earlier the better,

16
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,682
which allows the departments plenty of time to provide responses.

17
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:04,426
All public speakers should be signed in to speak. If you haven't, please signed in

18
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:07,986
on my left, on your right. And my staff member Carolina will

19
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:12,014
be monitoring the public speaker's list. Public speaker's

20
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:15,666
questions should be directed to City Council. If a public speaker would

21
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:19,574
like responses to any questions, they should submit their question to their

22
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,566
district council member or at large members.

23
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:26,274
Council members, the 2023 budget amendment template

24
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:29,846
has been uploaded to SharePoint. And as Mayor

25
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:33,750
Turner mentioned, all council offices

26
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,934
discussions on the 2023 proposed

27
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:40,326
budget will be handled there. Only operational budget

28
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:43,934
related amendments will be considered. Policy amendments should not

29
00:01:43,972 --> 00:01:46,542
be submitted and will be ruled out of order.

30
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:50,062
Amendments are due Wednesday the 25th,

31
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:53,694
a week from today. Today we will hear from the Houston

32
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:57,502
Airport System, houston Health Department and solid waste.

33
00:01:57,646 --> 00:02:00,942
As a reminder, only people attending virtually

34
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:05,002
are public speakers. And we'll get to their questions after the presentations

35
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:08,722
and after the questions from council member. It's my honor and pleasure

36
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:12,040
to welcome Director Mario Diaz and

37
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,598
Curtisia Hampton. Did I do right?

38
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:20,918
Okay. Of the Houston Airport system to provide an update.

39
00:02:21,094 --> 00:02:24,250
Good to see you, Director. How's everything?

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,540
This is going to be all about spaceport, right?

41
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,200
Shoot. Okay, welcome. Good to have you all.

42
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,680
Also, before we start yes, your mic is on. Like to welcome

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,680
staff from Council Member Amy Peck's office,

44
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,246
marianne Huffman office,

45
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:49,354
colossus Nero's office, and Council Member Sally Alcorn,

46
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,670
and staff from Vice Mayor Pro TEM Martha Castek Tatum,

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,094
and the lady who just came in because I parked next

48
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:02,786
to her, council Member Carolyn Nevin Shabbat and Vice Chair

49
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:04,630
Edward J. Pollard.

50
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,846
Mr. Chair, council members, welcome and thank you for the opportunity to share

51
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:14,122
with you our insights into the preparation for the 2023

52
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:17,866
fiscal year budget for the Houston Airport System. What I'd like to

53
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,274
do first is introduce the team. My team. As I've said

54
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:24,798
before, it is the team that gets things done.

55
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:28,282
In particular, I'd like to first introduce Jim Sesniak,

56
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:31,838
our new chief operating officer. I'm really, really delighted to have him on board

57
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:35,742
to help. We have Liliana Rambo, chief of Terminal

58
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:40,078
and also helpful with administrative matters.

59
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:44,510
Of course, you know Todd and you know Mayuri, the council liaisons.

60
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,490
We have James Stormsky,

61
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,650
who is the acting assistant director for Financial Planning.

62
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,054
We have Fruit Khan who is the budget manager. We have

63
00:03:56,172 --> 00:04:00,230
Anna Guerrero and Uber Khan and Tanya Harris,

64
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,350
all three of whom are financial analyst force.

65
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,860
And they've all assisted in putting this presentation together.

66
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,810
And then next to me, of course, is Katisha Hampton

67
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,986
who will help me with the presentation. Now,

68
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:20,586
Katisha is actually the chief auditor for the department,

69
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:24,094
but since we lost our chief financial officer not too long ago,

70
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:28,174
I've asked Katisha to help out pitch in and she's gladly

71
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:29,700
done that. Of course,

72
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,386
Katisha really handles more of the accounting matters for

73
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,922
the department and I handle the financial analyses

74
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:42,054
and financial aspects of the

75
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:45,654
finance department. What we'd like to do today

76
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:49,206
is I would first like to take this in two parts. In the

77
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:53,126
first part I'm going to go through and talk about some of the accomplishments

78
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:56,742
and some of the forecasts and projections that formulate the basis

79
00:04:56,806 --> 00:05:00,518
for the budget itself. And then Kirtisha will

80
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:03,822
go through the numbers. So, next slide please.

81
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:07,454
And of course we'll take questions. So the

82
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:11,466
first slide shows the budget cost centers for the department.

83
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:16,626
As you can see, we are proposing a total budget of $516.7

84
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:20,594
million that's total revenue and total expenses and

85
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:25,558
flow of to the

86
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:29,526
airport infrastructure fund. We have a

87
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:33,186
total of 1152 employees

88
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:37,490
or full time equivalents, and we have eleven cost centers.

89
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,178
Next slide please. When it

90
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:44,970
comes to accomplishments, I think there are just three that I want to highlight

91
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,542
and there is one Mr. Chair on the spaceport. Be patient

92
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:52,958
and we'll get to it in a second. First of

93
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:55,902
all, and this is the most important,

94
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:59,680
and it is that we've established Hobby as a five star

95
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,546
airport, the first five star airport in

96
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:07,234
all of North America by Skytracks. It is the first of the

97
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:11,742
60 odd airports that are tracked by Skytracks.

98
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:15,458
And it is really important because it gets us to half of

99
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:18,626
the way to our vision. Remember that the vision of the Houston

100
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:22,166
airport system is to create a global air service gateway where the magic of

101
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:25,654
flight is celebrated. The airport system has

102
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:29,158
two commercial airports. We have the spaceport, but it's

103
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:32,634
not a commercial airport. We have two commercial international airports, both of them

104
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:36,566
international. And we have accomplished the mission of becoming

105
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,158
a five star airport at Hobby. We are

106
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:44,190
now focusing with all our energy and focus

107
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,934
on intercontinental, to make that a five

108
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:51,726
star as well. Now this brings us, of course, to a

109
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:55,950
very, very special place in world airports. Only 16

110
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,586
airports, 15 and ourselves at Hobby are

111
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:02,100
rated five stars around the world.

112
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,006
And it's an accomplishment, as I say. That brings us to the point where we

113
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:10,018
can now say the vision we are halfway there on the vision

114
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:13,800
of becoming a global air Service gateway. Next.

115
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,186
The next that I would like to focus on

116
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,846
is the accomplishment of itrip. That is the International Terminal

117
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:25,206
Redevelopment Program. Construction has accelerated.

118
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:29,100
We are very well into the

119
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,862
ground. We will be coming out of the ground with steel probably

120
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,390
in the June, July time frame,

121
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,774
the Deep West Pier. And you'll see if you come

122
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:43,098
to next Thursday's Economic Development Committee, we will be putting on

123
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:46,466
a presentation devoted totally to the

124
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:49,954
International Terminal Redevelopment Program. And we will be

125
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:53,842
featuring a section of that of concern that I know is probably

126
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:58,210
on your minds today, which has been on our minds, which is the roadway congestion.

127
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,200
So we'll address those things.

128
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,698
The D West Pier, which is going to be the first installment

129
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:11,366
to be completed, will be delivered on schedule in June,

130
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:14,790
July of next year, that is, we will have a brand new pier.

131
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,582
The rest of the renovation of the North Terminal

132
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:22,526
will be completed by December of next year. And then in the June July time

133
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:26,254
frame for 2024, the entire project will have been

134
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,230
completed.

135
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,014
We are due to,

136
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:36,370
as I say, make a presentation to the Economic Development Committee on

137
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,794
the status, the complete status. And really, it's to talk

138
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:43,762
about the scale of this project. And you're going to see some slides when we

139
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:47,654
come in next Thursday of the huge structures that we've got

140
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:51,958
to bring in and lift into place to make this project

141
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:55,714
happen. The third accomplishment

142
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:59,530
that we're very, very proud of has to do with the spaceport.

143
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,866
Next slide, please. So in the

144
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:09,100
spaceport, we have been really,

145
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,206
it can't be said in any other way, more successful than

146
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:18,250
we ever imagined we would be with this spaceport

147
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,566
having completed and brought into the spaceport

148
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:26,162
system three top companies that

149
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:29,938
together will, in a matter of 15 to 18 months,

150
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:35,640
have about 650,000

151
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,282
manufacturing space in the aerospace sector. These are collins

152
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:45,142
Aerospace, of course, is the division of Raytheon Fortune 500

153
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:48,978
company. We have intuitive machines that will be building the Nova

154
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:52,218
Sea lander rocket propulsion systems. They're going to

155
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:56,726
the Moon later this month, the first commercial trip

156
00:09:56,758 --> 00:10:00,538
back to the Moon. And it will be from a company that actually produced the

157
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:04,046
landers and the propulsion system and navigation systems right here

158
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:07,834
in Houston. And, of course, we have Axiom Aerospace. Axiom,

159
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:12,094
as you may know, on May 21 excuse me,

160
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:16,990
April 21 completed its first flight

161
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,866
to the space station, delivering astronauts and

162
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:24,178
coming back. And, of course, last week, May 11, we had the

163
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:28,034
groundbreaking ceremony for Axiom at the Houston

164
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:32,040
spaceport. So we think that

165
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,026
the addition of these companies, the addition of this 650,000

166
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:42,106
manufacturing space will result in about 1000 to

167
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:45,658
1500 jobs, new jobs, well paying jobs within the

168
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:48,060
next 15 to 18 months.

169
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,798
Next slide, please. So what does the department do?

170
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:57,466
Well, I think our mission statement sums that up very, very nicely.

171
00:10:57,578 --> 00:11:01,278
It is that we exist to connect the

172
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:04,690
people, the business cultures and economies of the world

173
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,882
to Houston. Today, we provide about 184

174
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:12,354
destinations. From Intercontinental, 121 are

175
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:15,338
domestic, 63 are international.

176
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:18,242
From Hobby, we provide 84 destinations.

177
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:22,070
76 are domestic and eight are international.

178
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,426
At Intercontinental, domestic travel is exceeding international

179
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:31,066
recovery, 90% versus 77%.

180
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:35,558
The reverse is true at Hobby. At Hobby, we're recovering faster

181
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:39,466
in the international 91%. And by the way, these are percentages of

182
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:43,486
2019 traffic, 91% versus 82%

183
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:47,946
for domestic. We have four airlines that are exceeding

184
00:11:48,138 --> 00:11:52,590
their traffic levels at IH against

185
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,906
2019. So they're doing better, actually better than they

186
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:59,314
were in 2019. We have four airlines that are

187
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:03,038
still in the recovery phase. We have one airline that's

188
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:06,210
gone bankrupt, was Interjet. They simply couldn't make it.

189
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,442
And we have two airlines, Ethiopian and Air China,

190
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:12,658
that have not returned yet. But we expect Ethiopian Airlines

191
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:16,194
to return probably in the summer of this year. And hopefully Air China

192
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:19,802
will be not too far behind. And then,

193
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:23,290
despite the Pandemic, we're very, very happy to announce that

194
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,010
airlines like Allegiant, Frontier,

195
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,014
Southwest, American, Caribbean Airlines, delta, Spirit,

196
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:34,114
Suncountry, United, Viva, Airbus, and Veladis,

197
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:37,646
all added flights, all added service during the

198
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:41,054
Pandemic that we have just transitioned through.

199
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:42,750
Next slide.

200
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,534
So our strategic plan is fairly

201
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:50,782
simple. It's laid out, as I said, there's the mission,

202
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:54,446
and I've talked to the vision. What we are focusing

203
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:58,310
on is acting responsibly with

204
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,800
respect to social, environmental and

205
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,974
economic concerns. As I've mentioned, we are

206
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:09,446
generating jobs focusing on how to train the youth

207
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:13,062
of Houston for careers in aerospace manufacturing,

208
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,218
and improving the financial resilience of the airport system.

209
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:19,846
That goes to the second bullet, the International Terminal

210
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:23,498
Redevelopment Program, the Domestic Terminal Redevelopment Program that we're

211
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:27,102
going to launch as part of the capital program in the coming

212
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:30,874
year. And Southwest Airlines seven gate expansion

213
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:34,330
at Hobby are all platforms for future success.

214
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,606
And then, of course, we have collaboration with airlines, the federal agencies,

215
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:42,386
and concessionaires and contractors. All in addition to the

216
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:47,094
work that we're doing in shifting the culture within the organization that

217
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:50,946
addresses the final priority, which is to build relationships

218
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:54,866
and conditions

219
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:55,990
for betterment.

220
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,946
As you can see, what we really want to do

221
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:04,140
is in the next slide, please.

222
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,274
This slide shows traffic in

223
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:12,478
graph form. I'll have

224
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,094
a slide that comes right after this that'll simplify it. But you can

225
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:18,846
see the vagaries month by month,

226
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:22,158
year by year. We start with the

227
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:24,966
blue, which is the 2019,

228
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:28,466
and then from there, you descend down. I would

229
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:32,482
just point to two graphs on this. That is the one

230
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:36,962
for 2022, which terminates at 25.5

231
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:40,710
million. That's what we expect at the end of this year, June 30, when we

232
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,600
finalize the numbers, we'll come out at about $25.5 million,

233
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,440
25.5 million passengers. And then

234
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,066
for 2023, we're forecasting 29 million.

235
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,822
And that's just about 800,000 short of the 2019

236
00:14:56,966 --> 00:15:01,302
all time high. Next slide, please. This slide

237
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:05,342
better shows the point that I was making about the

238
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:08,606
trajectory and the path that we're following. As you can

239
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:12,602
see, we started out in 29.8 million employments

240
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:16,334
in 2019, and then of course, we dropped off and

241
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:19,698
we bottomed out in 2021, fiscal year 2021.

242
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:22,866
And then we've been increasing to where at the end

243
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:27,074
of this year, we expect to be about 25.5 and next year 29.8.

244
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:29,400
And then we'll continue on from there.

245
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,922
And so that concludes my part of the presentation.

246
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:37,346
If there are no questions at this point, I'll turn it over to Katisha

247
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:41,450
and she will carry on with the numbers. Next slide.

248
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,020
Good afternoon. So I'm going to talk about revenues by fund.

249
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,046
Oh, lord. Sorry. Thank you. I'm going to

250
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:57,486
talk about revenues by fund. And I'm really going

251
00:15:57,508 --> 00:16:00,954
to home in on our FY

252
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,942
19 actuals versus our proposed FY

253
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,986
23 because our FY 29,

254
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:11,998
this is more because we dipped down during the pandemic.

255
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:16,150
But we are expected to either

256
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,926
match or exceed 19 with our

257
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:23,942
revenues and expenditures and our employments. So in FY 23,

258
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:31,306
we propose our budget is about 516,719,000.

259
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:35,126
In FY 19, it was about 518.

260
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:38,982
So we're about 2 million under budget

261
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:42,890
for I mean, under revenues to match 2019,

262
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,760
which we're back on track. For FY 22, we had 478.

263
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,886
So our budget has increased about 8.1%.

264
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:56,194
And if you go to the next slide so

265
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:59,874
our budget has increased by 8.1% over

266
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:03,582
our FY 22 estimate. And our airline

267
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:07,090
revenues for landing and terminal rents are projected

268
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,120
to increase by 11.6 million.

269
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,722
Non revenues, parking will increase

270
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:18,554
by 12.1, ground transportation and

271
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:22,060
terminal concessions by 9.3 million.

272
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,380
And car rentals, about 4 million.

273
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,794
Revenues from facilities and other miscellaneous

274
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:34,350
revenues are projected to increase about 3 million.

275
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,506
And our other miscellaneous includes ground

276
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:40,830
rents, hangers rentals,

277
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,410
facility rentals, and interest income.

278
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,626
Next slide, please. We want

279
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:56,114
to show you our COVID related grants that the airport has

280
00:17:56,152 --> 00:18:00,134
received. So and we've received about

281
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:04,582
460,000,000, which is 458,000,000

282
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,470
that we have received,

283
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,786
that we are eligible for sorry, that's available to us.

284
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:15,482
We've received as of April 30 of

285
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:19,740
2022, we received 295,000,000.

286
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,382
Of that, we've used the entire 295.

287
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:28,222
So we have about 169,000,000 still

288
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:31,962
available for us to use for our COVID

289
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:33,410
related grants.

290
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,260
Next slide, please.

291
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,402
And now I'm going to go to expenditures. So our

292
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,980
expenditures for FY 23,

293
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,554
we are proposed to spend the

294
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:53,254
516, 719. And we can

295
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:57,222
look at FY 19 we had our actual was

296
00:18:57,276 --> 00:19:01,130
519 million. 519,000,000. So we're about

297
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,690
3 million below our FY 19 expenditures.

298
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,040
Next slide, please.

299
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,750
So our expenditure highlights,

300
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,422
we're about 4.4% increase

301
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:25,966
our expenditures and that is due to personnel

302
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:28,900
increase by 6.3 million.

303
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:34,574
Supplies and capital and supplies and non capital

304
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:37,846
equipment, we're going to increase that by about

305
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:42,214
0.2 million, about 200,000. Our contracted services

306
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:45,480
are increasing by 4.1%.

307
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,660
And we just want to point out here at the bottom,

308
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,866
we pay about 1.3 million and

309
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:02,006
3 million of our general fund is

310
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:05,498
services to the city for HPD,

311
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:09,434
fire rescue, HR, it legal

312
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:11,870
water and sewer, et cetera.

313
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,354
Next slide, please. So this is

314
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:19,602
the expenditures, the change

315
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:23,170
in every line item by category,

316
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,630
and I'm going to talk more about that on the next slide.

317
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,582
So next slide please. Oh, perfect, thank you.

318
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:33,910
So this is our FY 23,

319
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,106
which is our expenditures for

320
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:43,510
8012 I'm sorry, which is our capital improvement.

321
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,906
So it's about 26,000,001. Three six.

322
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:50,762
For our FY 23 and FY 19,

323
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:54,782
we're looking at about 3 million. And that is due to our

324
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,382
increase in all our 4%

325
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:02,074
increase in all our facility maintenance, our police,

326
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:04,926
fire, rescue act, aircraft rescue,

327
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,126
utilities, et cetera. Next slide,

328
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:08,740
please.

329
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,226
Our expenditure highlights. In our capital outlay

330
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:22,680
fund, which is our fund 8012,

331
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,902
our expenditures are projected to increase by

332
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:31,002
828.7% over our

333
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,742
FY 22 estimate. And that is mainly

334
00:21:34,886 --> 00:21:38,374
driven by our replacement of our has,

335
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,154
our fleet vehicles and HPD

336
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:46,862
vehicles. We actually had purchased vehicles in FY 22

337
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:50,798
and we did not receive them. So therefore, they had to

338
00:21:50,804 --> 00:21:54,090
be rolled over into our FY 23 budget.

339
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,094
So that is mainly the reason for such a high increase

340
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:01,602
in our capital outlay. And we had about 0.7

341
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:04,786
in our computer and hardware, computer hardware and

342
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:10,262
software, and about 0.5 million into our

343
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:14,214
furniture and equipment. And just

344
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:18,502
so I wanted to reiterate here, we're buying 25

345
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:22,722
electric FY F 150s that

346
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:26,614
those are in that fleet that will be rolled over for the FY

347
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:30,410
23 proposed budget. Next slide.

348
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,322
We wanted to break out our FY 23 budget,

349
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:39,006
personnel versus non personnel. And if you look

350
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:42,080
at non personnel, it was about 61%.

351
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,274
Fire rescue is the biggest portion of

352
00:22:46,312 --> 00:22:50,382
our non revenue. But I also wanted to highlight

353
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:54,014
on our contracted services, so our contracted

354
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:58,354
services are a big portion of our non personnel

355
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:02,278
as well. And so some of our top contracted services

356
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:05,782
are our security contract, which is about 4.8

357
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:09,722
million, landscaping is about 1.6

358
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:13,834
million, smart cart is about 1.4 million,

359
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:17,722
and our asset management is about 6.2.6

360
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:21,200
million. Next slide, please.

361
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,318
Here is a slide on our budget history. If you

362
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:30,378
look at our FY 23 proposed budget

363
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:34,210
versus our FY 19, we are

364
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,522
pretty much on target with our budget versus our

365
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:41,266
actuals with our FY 19 year,

366
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:45,438
because that is going to be our year that we are comparing

367
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:49,222
FY 23 to because our passenger levels are

368
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:51,400
back around that level.

369
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,040
Next slide, please.

370
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,758
And again, we want to thank you for our

371
00:23:58,844 --> 00:24:01,894
prep budget presentation hearing and to reiterate

372
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:05,846
that Hobby is the first five star airport

373
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,020
in North America. Any questions?

374
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,498
Yes, we have a number of council members in queue. We'll first go to council

375
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:16,350
member Abby Cayman. Thank you, Mayor Protem,

376
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,894
Director. Congratulations to you and the

377
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:24,930
entire airport system team, our partners at the airlines.

378
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,582
It's hard to know where to begin, right. With all of the success and progress

379
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:33,330
that's been made, whether it's at the spaceport or our traditional airports.

380
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,166
I wanted to just spotlight we have a lot of residents that

381
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:41,254
are continuing to enjoy the new child play area

382
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:44,438
at Hobby. When I was in there, I'm seeing it packed all the

383
00:24:44,444 --> 00:24:46,870
time. That's great. The new pet areas.

384
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,934
Can you remind me? I believe you touched on it at the beginning,

385
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:54,506
but there's been a lot of headaches. Understandably so

386
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:58,010
around Intercontinental with all of the construction,

387
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,880
and you've been very responsive to those needs. But can you go back to

388
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,862
when residents can expect some relief there?

389
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:11,422
Sure. Thank you for the question, council member. And so again,

390
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:15,682
next Thursday, we'll have a much more in depth presentation. But let me quickly

391
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:18,978
tick off a couple of points. The first point that I

392
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:22,900
would make is that I think we're over the hump on this one.

393
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,586
If we could do it over, actually, we'd have to do

394
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:31,190
it the same way. Here's the problem. It's real estate.

395
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,234
The way that we might have done it had we had the real estate,

396
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:39,234
was we would have built temporary roadways and put all the traffic on the temporary

397
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:43,094
roadways while we did the construction. But real estate

398
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:46,742
doesn't exist. We're in a canyon. Once you get into those roadways,

399
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:50,006
you've got parking garages on one side of the street, and you've

400
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:53,158
got terminal building, and we've got to work in

401
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,698
those streets. I think people don't appreciate the scale.

402
00:25:56,794 --> 00:26:00,206
And so please come next Thursday so that you can understand the scale and you

403
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:04,014
can see the huge structures that we're moving on

404
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:07,246
these caterpillars and actually lifting at night and

405
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:10,674
putting into place. We're just not

406
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:13,794
replacing the roof or replacing windows in a building. We are

407
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:17,122
completely redoing the entire international

408
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:19,750
building. But to the point precisely.

409
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,150
But to the point precisely.

410
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,406
As of June 6, we will have finished the elevators

411
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:33,338
in the international terminal. Why is this important?

412
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:36,902
Because we could not bring handicap

413
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:41,130
passengers down to the lower level to take them through the tunnels

414
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,430
to the other terminal buildings. And so what we're doing is,

415
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,886
once those elevators are in place, we will take the

416
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:51,162
buses that were outside that were transporting passengers,

417
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:54,310
and we will use those buses will be removed, and we'll

418
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,726
have another lane open that will increase the capacity on the roadways.

419
00:26:57,838 --> 00:27:01,266
Number two, in July, United Airlines, as you know,

420
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:04,674
they're building that at the same time. And we

421
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:07,670
probably could have done a little bit better of coordinating with them on that.

422
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,782
But they're building this massive early bag short system because they really

423
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:15,714
want to grow in Houston. It's a 400 million dollar investment.

424
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,918
It's wonderful once they have it in place.

425
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:22,374
But they needed to take down the roadways, and they limited

426
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:25,734
to one lane. Now, they tell us that as of July,

427
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:28,742
middle of July, that lane will be improved,

428
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:32,926
and the departures lane will all merge so that traffic should

429
00:27:32,948 --> 00:27:36,446
flow much more smoothly through that area. And then in October of

430
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:39,962
this year, that will be done. That project will be done, and roadways

431
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:43,758
will be cleared. June 6

432
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:47,922
of next year, we will have the first installment for the,

433
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:51,086
as I said, the Dwest Pier. And once that Dwest Pier

434
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:55,378
is opened, we will have a much better time and

435
00:27:55,544 --> 00:27:58,854
movement of traffic off of the roadways on the north the

436
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:02,562
terminal into that area. And then come June,

437
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:05,986
July of 2024, the project is finished.

438
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:09,894
Now, that's not to say it's over, because immediately

439
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,626
we are now focusing on the infrastructure inside the

440
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:17,462
roadways. We're replacing all of the water lines, the water mains.

441
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:21,242
We've got to put in high pressure water, because once

442
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:24,654
we start councilman Robinson, you know that once we touch

443
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:27,802
a building, you now must meet the new codes.

444
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:31,166
And one of those codes means you got to be sprinklers. We don't have the

445
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:35,650
water pressure. And so the new early the enabling

446
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,666
project that we have for the water will provide tanks, provide new

447
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:43,346
wells and pumps that will and new lines that will be

448
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:47,186
able to keep the water pressure at high enough level to actually

449
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:51,046
sprinkle all of the buildings without having to have pumps and tanks in each

450
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:54,774
one of those buildings. So that will continue. And then next year,

451
00:28:54,812 --> 00:28:58,600
we're going to be starting on the same project

452
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,860
just at the other end of the terminal. The terminal a redevelopment program.

453
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,890
It's another billion plus investment we need to make

454
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,794
because we need to continue investing for the airlines. They've asked

455
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,334
us for 17 gates. We have a plan. We will be

456
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:18,430
bringing that forward to Economic Development Committee as well. So I do think that

457
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,854
we are now really starting to see the light

458
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:24,526
at the end of the tunnel on this. And we hope that as the summer

459
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,970
progresses, things will improve continually.

460
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,726
If I could be placed back in queue. Council Member

461
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:33,090
Sally Alcorn.

462
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,038
Thank you, Chair. On page 14,

463
00:29:39,214 --> 00:29:43,174
the $103,000,000 breakdown that you give to the that

464
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:46,578
goes to to the city, to the general fund. If I could just you don't

465
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:48,566
have to give it to me now, but if I could get a breakdown on

466
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:52,040
that. Sure. And and to Council Member Cayman's Point,

467
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,410
what what can we do in this budget cycle to help you

468
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,370
with the traffic situation? Is it HPD?

469
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,006
It's really hard to explain what you just explained to constituents

470
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:07,166
who call that's a lot of

471
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:10,906
moving parts. Is there anything else besides

472
00:30:10,938 --> 00:30:14,526
just the things that have to happen to open up lanes that can

473
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:17,706
be done to steer traffic?

474
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:20,626
We tell people, take the train to A, we'll pick you up at A,

475
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:24,254
or get the Uber from A or whatever. I mean, what kind of practical advice

476
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:27,634
or what can we do during the budget cycle to help you.

477
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:31,014
I think that the one point that we try to make

478
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:34,502
over and over. And I know we do it lightly because

479
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:38,182
we don't want people to think that they've got to spend their life

480
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:42,090
at the airport, but come early so that

481
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,546
you have enough time to get to the traffic so

482
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:49,126
that you are comfortable that you will make your flight. And then here's

483
00:30:49,158 --> 00:30:52,906
the second thing we're doing. One of the things that we've noticed is that what

484
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,942
we call irregular operations. So for example, let's say that we have once

485
00:30:56,996 --> 00:31:00,554
the flights launch from Asia, they launch from Europe. They can't

486
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:03,950
stop. They've got to continue. Once they're over the North Atlantic or the Pacific,

487
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,818
you just can't tell those airplanes to return.

488
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:10,226
But let's say the weather changes and

489
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:13,614
we're now in a thunderstorm condition. Those aircraft

490
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:17,106
have to be held. They start circulating at altitudes of

491
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:20,614
about 1000ft. They're stacked one on top of another.

492
00:31:20,732 --> 00:31:24,754
And of course, I was going to go pick up grandma or my wife

493
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:27,446
or my kids and they were supposed to arrive at five. Well, guess what?

494
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,978
The aircraft is still in hold position and now I am circulating.

495
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:34,874
So what we're going to do as one of the measures that we were taking

496
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:38,662
is when we see this condition, we're going to open up the parking garages.

497
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:41,434
We're going to just let people go in. We're not going to charge them.

498
00:31:41,472 --> 00:31:44,954
We need to get them off the roadways. We need to find containment

499
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:48,094
areas where we can get them off the roadways. And that way the traffic will

500
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:51,806
circulate much better. Okay, great.

501
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:55,354
And just congrats on the spaceport stuff too. And on hobby.

502
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:58,546
I mean, that's the most and to me the most exciting thing going on in

503
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:00,980
Houston, Texas right now. It's really great.

504
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,330
Council member. Cayman.

505
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,706
Thank you. Chair Director just as we

506
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:12,070
talked about construction, I just want to highlight and we can discuss

507
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,130
offline the importance of as we're looking at new plans and new facilities.

508
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,386
We are now the hub of innovation as we've always been. But that's really our

509
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:22,806
thing. So I want to make sure that as we're building, our buildings

510
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:26,454
themselves are pushing the envelope in terms of sustainability,

511
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:30,238
resiliency best practices in

512
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:33,786
terms of environmental sustainability.

513
00:32:33,978 --> 00:32:38,846
Really quickly, I wanted to recognize you all at

514
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:42,286
the airports we got an increase in the minimum wage to 15, which I

515
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:45,570
think is a really remarkable and important thing to recognize.

516
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,418
My hope is that you all will continue to look again. We've just passed at

517
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:52,020
the city paid parental leave,

518
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,566
going to the next step in terms of our Janitorial contracts,

519
00:32:57,598 --> 00:33:01,394
our subcontractors, things like that, to push to make sure that everyone is included

520
00:33:01,442 --> 00:33:04,514
in those things. And if you all could provide just offline

521
00:33:04,562 --> 00:33:08,026
and we can submit the question and update on the progress in

522
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:11,194
terms of Janitorial pay and things like that, I would

523
00:33:11,232 --> 00:33:12,860
appreciate that. Sure.

524
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,794
Finally, Council Member Alcorn asked it, and I'll ask

525
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:22,886
it a different way, given the constraints that the city continues

526
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:26,394
to face. I know the airports are succeeding.

527
00:33:26,442 --> 00:33:29,726
They are doing very well. Are there any other needs that we should be

528
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:32,746
aware of that are coming up on the horizon that you want to flag for

529
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:35,666
us? I can't think of any.

530
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:39,538
You've been very supportive. We're very grateful, and thank you

531
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:42,754
for everything you're doing to support us on this.

532
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:45,460
Thanks so much. Thank you.

533
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,686
So, Director, nobody else in queue, I'll ask a couple

534
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,590
of questions. So I'm looking at your revenue page.

535
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,254
$517,000,000. Do we have any

536
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:59,010
additional funds that come in from FAA and all that kind of

537
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,522
stuff? Your budget is always

538
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:06,182
the most difficult one to understand because you have sources

539
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:09,722
of revenue and expenses all over the place that are not in the general

540
00:34:09,776 --> 00:34:12,906
fund. So we don't have purview to it.

541
00:34:13,088 --> 00:34:16,474
If you look at the CAFR, it has four line items every monthly,

542
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:19,934
and you can't get much with four line items. So I'm trying to dig

543
00:34:19,972 --> 00:34:23,746
down into everything you have coming in, everything you

544
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:27,314
have going out, including the what's our

545
00:34:27,352 --> 00:34:31,090
international stuff called hasdc

546
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,606
does not well, I know, but it still has

547
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:39,666
a revenue stream. I get it. It's a separate organization.

548
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:43,286
I get it. But when it has Houston Airport system on

549
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:47,254
it, then I feel somewhat I should

550
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:50,582
be knowledgeable, but no one knows anything about

551
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:53,498
them. Maybe that's way it's supposed to be, I don't know. But getting back to

552
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:56,650
my original question, on the revenue side,

553
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,850
517,

554
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,160
is there FAA money? What does that amount to?

555
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,046
You make a good point. So let's look what what this

556
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:11,594
budget addresses. General fund is what we call operating revenue,

557
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,906
right? Operating revenue. Let's talk about non operating revenue

558
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:18,242
from an accounting point of view. So there are a couple of more line

559
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:21,986
items on revenue that we would address or we would bring forward

560
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:26,114
for your attention. For example, the biggest of those, aside from

561
00:35:26,232 --> 00:35:29,334
grants, we'll get to grants in a second. We'll focus on a second.

562
00:35:29,372 --> 00:35:32,646
But the biggest non operating revenue that we have, of course,

563
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:35,626
is PFCs. So we collect 450,

564
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:39,162
and we just multiply 450

565
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:43,114
times 30 million employments. You're at 120,

566
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,794
some odd million dollars, 120 plus maybe

567
00:35:46,832 --> 00:35:50,598
$140,000,000 of PFC revenue.

568
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:53,658
Now, it's restricted with respect to what we can do for it,

569
00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:57,070
but we can use it for four purposes. Number one

570
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,286
is to expand the national Airspace system. That is, if we can use it for

571
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:04,234
runways, taxways and things like that. We can use it for terminal buildings.

572
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:08,402
We could use it to security, to enhance the security of

573
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:12,254
the airports. We could use for noise mitigation around the communities.

574
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:15,298
And we have spent some of that money, and we use it for competition to

575
00:36:15,304 --> 00:36:19,154
bring in new airlines. So that's what the roughly

576
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:22,850
100 and 3140 million PFCs can be used for. And it's

577
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:27,046
very helpful. Principally, we. Use PFCs to

578
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:30,906
write down the debt service that we have to pay every year. That's how

579
00:36:30,928 --> 00:36:34,970
we use the money. The second source of course, is in this case

580
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,670
for the past is the grants, the Cares Krisa

581
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,680
and ARPA grants. $450,000,000, that's a one off thing.

582
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,694
And as Katisha said, we've received about 300 million

583
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:51,214
of it. There's still about 160,000,000 or so to be

584
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:54,494
received and we're using those monies. We did use

585
00:36:54,532 --> 00:36:58,882
about 92 million of that debt, as you saw on the line, of 120,

586
00:36:58,936 --> 00:37:02,350
some odd million to assist the airlines

587
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,166
because to the extent that we use grants, they didn't have to pay the debt

588
00:37:05,198 --> 00:37:08,078
service on that grant. But again,

589
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:11,542
the line share as you see on that page, is really

590
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:14,854
again to offset debt service. And for next year

591
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:19,050
we'll be using another 50 million and then another 50 million. And that'll

592
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,362
essentially use up the remainder of the grants that we have.

593
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:28,198
2nd, 3rd item is grants, FA grants.

594
00:37:28,294 --> 00:37:31,758
So we receive. And we need to

595
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:35,566
do a better job because we think that there's more FAA grants out there to

596
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:39,022
be to be obtained, but roughly about

597
00:37:39,076 --> 00:37:43,054
$50 to $60 million a year that we want to

598
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:46,654
bring in on an annual basis, either in terms of entitlements,

599
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:50,334
because we are entitled to grants on the basis of passenger

600
00:37:50,382 --> 00:37:54,110
traffic and cargo that we move through our two airports. Our three airports.

601
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,850
And then of course, the last one is interest on reserves.

602
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,760
We have about a billion dollars in the bank and so

603
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,222
inflation is when interest rates rise. Of course

604
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:11,154
that becomes a fairly good source of additional incremental income.

605
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:14,620
So those four sources are not in these numbers, right?

606
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,506
And before we go, I know council Member David Robinson's in Q. Yes,

607
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:22,590
here's my problem, okay? And this is just a me issue.

608
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,066
I pride myself on trying to know everything about the financial

609
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:30,766
position the city is in, whether it's public works,

610
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:34,720
whether it's enterprise, whether it's general, whether it's airport, and nothing.

611
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,722
We have a guy who shows up here every other week. He has a name

612
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:42,066
very similar to yours and he sticks a microphone in front of all

613
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:46,018
of our eyes, ears and mouths with questions

614
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:49,320
that quite frankly we can't answer

615
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,870
and when we can't answer. And they show it, they love

616
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,550
showing it on the news to make us look like a bunch of idiots,

617
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,880
quite frankly. That's it.

618
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,882
That's part of the world we live in today. It's a lot different than,

619
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:09,430
you know, Walter Cronkite days, but there's a mission

620
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,434
and I feel so inept many times when I see

621
00:39:13,472 --> 00:39:16,618
him out there and I run away from him because I know what questions he's

622
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:20,046
going to ask and it's going to be related to your enterprise and

623
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:23,694
I feel inadequate about answering it. I don't know how everybody else

624
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:27,314
around here feels, but that's just a me issue because there are

625
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:31,054
so many moving parts and you and I have had various conversations.

626
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,418
I've been here longer than anyone, and I trust you implicitly, and you do a

627
00:39:34,424 --> 00:39:37,814
great job. And the Houston Airport System is

628
00:39:37,852 --> 00:39:40,966
a well run, organized machine. Some of the

629
00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:44,450
things we do there, especially what's going to happen down south,

630
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:49,782
is monumental. But FCC

631
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:53,434
money, general funds, revenue, all these different things.

632
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:59,020
And then a guy shows up with a microphone, and I just feel

633
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,974
unprepared many times. So that's why some of my questions dig

634
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:06,414
a little bit deeper. Ha SDC. I'd love to know

635
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:09,866
what more is there about the Houston Airport System Development

636
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:13,374
Corporation? We should be proud that we have airports that we

637
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:16,994
run, operate in Costa Rica, in other

638
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:20,498
parts of the world, nobody else is doing innovative things like this.

639
00:40:20,664 --> 00:40:24,318
So I'd like to know more about it so I can educate

640
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:27,794
the public who votes for me or doesn't vote for me that they go,

641
00:40:27,832 --> 00:40:30,886
look at that guy, he knows more about it. We trust him. But there are

642
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:35,350
many times I don't feel that way. But that's a me issue. David Robinson

643
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,566
I thought there was going to be a question at the end of all that

644
00:40:38,588 --> 00:40:41,894
for the there is. Sounded like he might want to refer to my favorite architect.

645
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:45,498
Did you have anything you wanted to respond to? The chair the only response that

646
00:40:45,504 --> 00:40:48,842
I would give is that we follow

647
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,586
the protocol. We follow the rules in preparing the budget and providing

648
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:56,640
information. If you would like a different format, if you would like

649
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,846
to expand the scope of the information, we'd be happy to

650
00:41:00,868 --> 00:41:04,314
provide it. We're not looking to in any way shelter

651
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:08,178
or restrict information. We're just following the program here.

652
00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:11,314
Right. And I think, Chair, that's part of the reason I wanted to hear that

653
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:15,238
preliminary answer, because frankly, my line of questioning was along some of

654
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:18,966
the lines you've pursued. And I've been fortunate enough to

655
00:41:18,988 --> 00:41:22,390
travel with Director Diaz to some points

656
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,618
with mayoral delegations in South America.

657
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:29,794
We've passed through I've passed through not with you, but Ecuador,

658
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:33,494
Costa Rica. You've mentioned some of the investments that we have in the portfolio

659
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:37,194
of airports that we've assisted with globally. And it is

660
00:41:37,312 --> 00:41:41,786
really something for us to be very proud about. And Director

661
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:45,390
Diaz, I think that is something that I share the Chair's interest

662
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,466
in knowing more and understanding about, but understanding

663
00:41:49,498 --> 00:41:52,914
that that's outside of the budget, that you have

664
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:55,970
to operate your department.

665
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,906
That's kind of where I wanted to see if I could

666
00:41:59,928 --> 00:42:03,700
take a moment and get your feedback on the extra

667
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:08,118
budgetary issues that I've heard you talk about already

668
00:42:08,204 --> 00:42:11,366
today. There are capital improvements that

669
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:14,946
are going on at all three airport spaces in the city of Houston

670
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:18,658
right now. That's not what you use to run your department on

671
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:22,198
an annual basis, and it's really not what's in our budget.

672
00:42:22,294 --> 00:42:25,706
And I'm thinking about how we,

673
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:29,706
with your help, could get to a better understanding how some of

674
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:33,294
those capital improvements go on concurrently while you're running

675
00:42:33,332 --> 00:42:37,086
an airport system. And if you follow me, this is where

676
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:40,510
the things that the Chair and I have been on the news

677
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,078
along with you recently are problems,

678
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:47,502
whether it's congestion at the airport that you've addressed with

679
00:42:47,556 --> 00:42:50,842
questions from Council today. I think I was recently

680
00:42:50,906 --> 00:42:54,426
interrogated for why there weren't enough bathrooms

681
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:58,054
open. Did they interrogated? I think I did. And so the fact

682
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:01,586
that you didn't have enough bathrooms open became something that apparently

683
00:43:01,618 --> 00:43:05,318
I should have known about. And I do care about the architecture that

684
00:43:05,324 --> 00:43:09,082
you're investing in. And you know as well as I do that I've had some

685
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:12,698
serious questions for your design team, but that is,

686
00:43:12,784 --> 00:43:16,554
again, extra curricular for you.

687
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:20,182
And as the director who I feel is the most scrutinized,

688
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:23,694
the most audited, and perhaps the most or

689
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:26,942
the least understood, I wonder if you could shed some light

690
00:43:26,996 --> 00:43:30,286
on the separation of those basic components of

691
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,680
what you do every day.

692
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,500
I'm the chief executive for this organization called the Houston Airport System.

693
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,546
And right now, as I said, I'm very happy to

694
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:47,990
have Jim Sesniak, who is now the chief operating officer.

695
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,534
Jim made a very good point. We had our

696
00:43:52,572 --> 00:43:56,514
enterprise meeting, quarterly enterprise

697
00:43:56,562 --> 00:44:00,330
meeting with the entire organization. He made a really interesting point

698
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,070
that the CEO focuses on the organization

699
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:08,250
and the CEO operates within the organization.

700
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:12,960
So Jim's responsibly enrolled will be on the operational side

701
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:17,150
because the capital side of

702
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,598
this organization is

703
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:25,780
as large or not larger than the operational side.

704
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,740
When you really start to think about and again,

705
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,362
you'll see some videos. Last night we lifted in place

706
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:37,494
a section of truss that was 120ft in

707
00:44:37,532 --> 00:44:40,966
length that was brought in on one

708
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:44,306
of those bogeys that was erected,

709
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:47,686
actually put in place right outside the airport because it

710
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:51,446
couldn't be transported. And we brought it in on 11:00

711
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:54,810
at night. They started and they finished at 03:00 in the morning.

712
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,378
Lifting this thing by huge cranes and putting it in place.

713
00:44:58,464 --> 00:45:01,662
This is not a small operation. It takes

714
00:45:01,716 --> 00:45:05,246
a lot of attention to details. Councilman, as you

715
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:08,670
know, when it comes to design, you talk about

716
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,090
design management. I've been the design manager

717
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,034
with your assistance, and we've taken a look, and I have

718
00:45:16,072 --> 00:45:19,234
rejected many, many designs, many, many proposals. I've said,

719
00:45:19,272 --> 00:45:22,626
no, that's not what we want. We want something better. I have

720
00:45:22,648 --> 00:45:26,478
pushed the designers. I've put them in competition with one another, and they've

721
00:45:26,494 --> 00:45:29,702
come up with a phenomenal design for that terminal build.

722
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:32,280
I think when this thing next year,

723
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,674
hopefully you will all come out for the ribbon cutting for the Dwest

724
00:45:36,722 --> 00:45:39,946
Pier. You're going to see a pier that is the

725
00:45:39,968 --> 00:45:43,946
first installment of a terminal that you've never seen

726
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:47,258
the likes of in this city. It's just going to be beautiful.

727
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:51,034
Absolutely and absolutely functional, because we

728
00:45:51,072 --> 00:45:54,142
really want to pump a lot of traffic through there. Now,

729
00:45:54,276 --> 00:45:58,186
having said that, I also have to focus on the finance

730
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:02,126
and I've got to focus on the business and chiefly the

731
00:46:02,148 --> 00:46:05,402
negotiations with the airlines, because that's the difficult

732
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:08,994
part. Over the course of my

733
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,146
career, I've learned that you don't go into the office of a

734
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:15,782
CEO and say, hey, we want you to come to Houston or to

735
00:46:15,836 --> 00:46:19,080
Atlanta or to New York. Well, New York is different.

736
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:25,446
Houston or Atlanta, and we want you to provide service and

737
00:46:25,468 --> 00:46:28,598
you want to show them photos, because what they say to

738
00:46:28,604 --> 00:46:32,380
me is, mario, those photos are really nice. What's the cost?

739
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:37,626
What's the increase going to be? How much assurance can

740
00:46:37,648 --> 00:46:40,710
you give me about the control of costs in your airport?

741
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,240
What's the market? How's your economy going?

742
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:48,042
And you've got to be able to answer all those questions. So as the CEO,

743
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:51,466
I need to take on that role. And it's

744
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:55,554
difficult. It's something that it's not

745
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:59,394
a five day a week, nine to five job. It's a

746
00:46:59,432 --> 00:47:00,580
day a week job.

747
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,994
It is. And thank you for that. And that's why we try and our

748
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,998
responsibility is to direct everything to you,

749
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:13,558
not to them. As a board of directors, sort of for the city,

750
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:16,646
we have to go right to you and we hold you accountable. We don't want

751
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:20,506
to go to your people. So this

752
00:47:20,528 --> 00:47:24,118
is our big chance to get an opportunity to do that. Council member tarsha

753
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:28,026
Jackson thank you, chair. Thank you.

754
00:47:28,128 --> 00:47:31,866
And my colleague, what he just mentioned, that trying to understand

755
00:47:31,968 --> 00:47:35,742
the airport and their budget. I mean, airport is in district b. And so

756
00:47:35,876 --> 00:47:39,406
it's been a challenge for me trying to understand your operation. And so I would

757
00:47:39,428 --> 00:47:43,086
love to just spend more time with you guys so that I can just

758
00:47:43,268 --> 00:47:46,174
be able to represent my constituents better.

759
00:47:46,372 --> 00:47:49,826
And so hopefully we can do that soon in the future. But I do have

760
00:47:49,848 --> 00:47:53,346
a question about the ARPA dollars. You mentioned that you give

761
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:57,206
the ARPA dollars to airlines. And I'm just trying to understand that. Do the

762
00:47:57,388 --> 00:48:00,200
airlines apply for ARPA dollars themselves? No,

763
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,034
we did all the applications as the city of Houston,

764
00:48:04,162 --> 00:48:06,854
department of aviation, houston airport system,

765
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:10,746
and all of

766
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:14,458
the cares act, the Chris act,

767
00:48:14,544 --> 00:48:18,442
and the ARP act dollars were provided to us

768
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:22,414
by formula generally. The formula is

769
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:26,410
that there's a pot that the federal government has available for airports,

770
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,574
and you will get the proportionate share of that pot

771
00:48:30,772 --> 00:48:34,878
relative or related to the proportionate share that your airport

772
00:48:35,054 --> 00:48:38,626
in terms of passengers, represents to

773
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:42,660
the total passengers across the country. And that percentage we get,

774
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:46,466
we've done pretty well. And then the question is, well, how do you

775
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:49,670
use it? And you remember during the depths of the pandemic,

776
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,746
one of the questions that came up was how do we help the airlines,

777
00:48:53,778 --> 00:48:57,446
how do we help the concessionnaires? And you can

778
00:48:57,468 --> 00:49:01,670
see in the Krisa act, there's actually a line item out

779
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,034
for crystal concessions. And this is money that we were to pass

780
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:08,266
on. We couldn't keep it. This money that we had to pass on for the

781
00:49:08,288 --> 00:49:11,450
concession years, which we did, which is about 24 actually,

782
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,702
total of $30 million. And then the rest of the money,

783
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:18,218
it's a question, we could use it for any lawful purpose

784
00:49:18,314 --> 00:49:21,438
of the airport system. And we decided that one of

785
00:49:21,444 --> 00:49:24,566
the best use of that money was to help our airline partners

786
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:27,602
to the tune of about $92 million. But that's it.

787
00:49:27,656 --> 00:49:31,362
Now we move forward and we're spending the rest to carry our

788
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:35,390
contracts, our sky train parking contracts,

789
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,222
manage those, use that money for those, and then of course to write

790
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,574
down the debt service so that we get to a net debt service payment

791
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:47,106
that we can very well afford. Okay. Council member

792
00:49:47,138 --> 00:49:50,426
Cayman. Thank you Chair. And to

793
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:55,238
Council Member Robinson's point, I appreciate that perspective, right minutiae

794
00:49:55,254 --> 00:49:58,442
of the day to day versus overseeing all

795
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:02,014
that you are overseeing, which is again, not just

796
00:50:02,052 --> 00:50:07,354
our airports and not just global expansion, but galactic

797
00:50:07,402 --> 00:50:11,054
expansion, for lack of a better word. So I appreciate you,

798
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:15,118
I've never known you to be anything but responsive

799
00:50:15,294 --> 00:50:18,814
directly to me, to staff, your staff included.

800
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:22,434
So again, I just want to recognize how

801
00:50:22,472 --> 00:50:25,822
far we've come and the instrumental nature in which our airports

802
00:50:25,886 --> 00:50:29,158
play. Again, it's under economic development because of all the

803
00:50:29,164 --> 00:50:32,230
things we're doing, without the airports, we can't bring people in.

804
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,382
So just wanted to recognize that. If I might,

805
00:50:35,436 --> 00:50:38,140
just one last point that I would make.

806
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:42,250
It's not about me. As I mentioned

807
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,754
at the groundbreaking ceremony, I might be the

808
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:49,398
idea guy, I might be the strategist, I might be the visionary,

809
00:50:49,494 --> 00:50:53,310
but it's these individuals and the entire 1100

810
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,880
members of the Houston airport system that make happen

811
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,990
what has happened to this point. And I'm really, really proud of them.

812
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,762
They're the ones that get the job done. Thank you. Council Member

813
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:08,514
Sally Alcorn. Thank you Chair. And I think you addressed most

814
00:51:08,552 --> 00:51:12,162
of this in your response to Council Member Jackson. I appreciate you having slide twelve

815
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:16,014
in here to talk about the Krisa and the ARPA and the Cares funding.

816
00:51:16,142 --> 00:51:19,438
And I think I heard you say I was going to ask and

817
00:51:19,464 --> 00:51:23,346
I'm always blown away by when he just blows a billion dollars in reserves.

818
00:51:23,378 --> 00:51:26,886
I mean it was a billion dollars in reserves before the Pandemic. It's a

819
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:31,030
billion dollars in reserves now because

820
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,586
of this money. Correct? That's pretty much it.

821
00:51:34,768 --> 00:51:38,250
And then this 162,000,000 left,

822
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,530
I think you said you're paying down debt with it and

823
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,402
honoring some contracts and we'll be covering the parking

824
00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:49,166
contract. It's about $30 million. And then there's the sky train

825
00:51:49,268 --> 00:51:52,986
contract as well that we will be covered. Okay. And then that's

826
00:51:53,018 --> 00:51:55,780
the end of and then that's the end. Got it. Thank you.

827
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:59,842
So of the $207,000,000 of

828
00:51:59,896 --> 00:52:02,690
debt, how much is that is related to itrip?

829
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,962
Very little. Very little. What is that mostly related now? We only,

830
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:11,190
I think, in 2021, we fixed out about 265,000,000.

831
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,722
That is, we transferred it from commercial paper to bonds.

832
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:18,406
And I think the interest rate on those was three and a half to 4%.

833
00:52:18,508 --> 00:52:21,898
So there's not a lot. As a matter of fact, one of the things that

834
00:52:21,904 --> 00:52:25,338
we will need to do again, from wearing the financial hat is

835
00:52:25,424 --> 00:52:29,146
this summer and into fall, we will be undertaking a

836
00:52:29,168 --> 00:52:32,890
financial feasibility study. Because sometime between now

837
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,938
and February of next year, we will need to be back into the capital markets

838
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:40,266
to draw down and fix out the commercial

839
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:44,046
paper that we spent today. We've got $350,000,000 of commercial paper.

840
00:52:44,148 --> 00:52:47,906
We need to unload that, fix it, and then

841
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:51,314
secure another $350,000,000 to finish out the

842
00:52:51,352 --> 00:52:54,962
financing for itrip. So I would say that by the end of,

843
00:52:55,016 --> 00:52:59,046
let's say June, July of 2024, we will have fixed out and

844
00:52:59,068 --> 00:53:02,454
again, the total amount in terms of bonds is

845
00:53:02,492 --> 00:53:05,894
likely to be about $750,000,000. Total bonds, total cost

846
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,030
of I trip will be 1.3 billion.

847
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:13,174
1.3. Right. Okay. And expected

848
00:53:13,222 --> 00:53:15,898
completion date June July of 2024.

849
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:18,698
2024. Yes.

850
00:53:18,864 --> 00:53:22,990
And no other council members give me my last question. I know that always

851
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,638
tell people, if Houston Airport was a

852
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:29,950
company into itself, it'd be a Fortune 500 company. It's that big.

853
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:33,634
It's a money making machine. Billion dollars in

854
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:37,086
liquidity. Right. It's a very successful

855
00:53:37,278 --> 00:53:40,434
business, but yet we're still

856
00:53:40,472 --> 00:53:44,194
the city of Houston. And I understand recently good to have Jim here,

857
00:53:44,232 --> 00:53:47,526
but I understand we lost a COO. I understand we lost our

858
00:53:47,548 --> 00:53:51,814
CFO. That's why Ms. Hampton is probably sitting in your

859
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:55,494
ability to recruit and maintain employees, given the

860
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,220
dynamics of what we have to operate under.

861
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,410
So two things are happening. First is that,

862
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,926
as you all know, the great resignation is affecting

863
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:08,620
us all. And it's an employee market.

864
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:12,766
Employees are basically calling their shots. They're establishing what

865
00:54:12,788 --> 00:54:17,120
they want in terms not just of pay, but also the benefits

866
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,146
that they're available. And then some opportunities are opening

867
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:24,946
up. So our chief commercial officer left to become

868
00:54:25,048 --> 00:54:29,010
the CEO of John Wayne in California.

869
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:33,742
Let's talk about this for a second, because, again, building leadership

870
00:54:33,806 --> 00:54:37,490
is also part of my job. We start out with

871
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,654
biodari. Baron Biodari, former COO. He's now

872
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:45,778
managing the world's busiest airport as the director of Hartsville

873
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:50,014
Jackson Land International. Lance. Little former CLO.

874
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:52,410
He is now the managing director,

875
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,682
seattle Tacoma. Right. Okay. I'm sorry. No,

876
00:54:56,816 --> 00:55:00,026
I was answering Seattle Tacoma. Right. Yes. Seattle Tacoma. He was

877
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:03,274
awesome. He is now the managing director of Seattle Tacoma.

878
00:55:03,402 --> 00:55:07,146
We had Ted Kitchens, who was formerly running Intercontinental.

879
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:10,330
He's running now an airport as executive

880
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:14,322
just outside of Boston. You have Perry Miller, who was

881
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:17,374
running manager of Hobby. He's now running richmond,

882
00:55:17,422 --> 00:55:21,710
Virginia. And we now have Charlene Reynolds,

883
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:26,066
who came in very, very short sprint and is now managing

884
00:55:26,258 --> 00:55:29,574
John Wayne Airport. And so when

885
00:55:29,612 --> 00:55:33,474
it comes to the CFO, the gentleman

886
00:55:33,522 --> 00:55:37,026
walks into my office and says, thank you for everything you've

887
00:55:37,058 --> 00:55:40,746
done. I've learned how to sell and

888
00:55:40,848 --> 00:55:44,234
finance debt in the capital markets. You got to pay me

889
00:55:44,272 --> 00:55:47,754
for that now. I said, wait a minute. We did. We gave

890
00:55:47,792 --> 00:55:52,130
you the education. Yeah, but I've

891
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:56,026
got a baby coming. I've got a new house. I need more money, and they've

892
00:55:56,058 --> 00:55:59,742
offered me more. I can't match it. And so we just

893
00:55:59,796 --> 00:56:03,306
need to move on, and Leticia

894
00:56:03,338 --> 00:56:05,780
is doing a great job. Thank you. Yes.

895
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,594
I look at you and I would say you're closer to

896
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:14,018
your end of your career than the beginning of your career. So we're going

897
00:56:14,024 --> 00:56:18,118
to be faced with where does the replacement for Mario Diaz come from?

898
00:56:18,284 --> 00:56:22,166
Is that person internal or external? That's something to discuss on

899
00:56:22,188 --> 00:56:25,718
another day. We have a number of public speakers that want to ask questions,

900
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:29,894
so thanks for the opportunity to get

901
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:33,514
into it. We could probably sit here for a couple of hours and talk

902
00:56:33,552 --> 00:56:37,562
about airport because I'm sort of a geek. I find

903
00:56:37,616 --> 00:56:40,850
what you guys and ladies do every day sort of fascinating

904
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,314
and always tell everybody, we'll be down in spaceport tonight.

905
00:56:44,362 --> 00:56:47,950
We have our redistricting meeting at Space Center. And always

906
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,342
tell people, when we moved here in

907
00:56:51,396 --> 00:56:54,706
1990, hobby was this little bitty sleepy airport to

908
00:56:54,728 --> 00:56:57,902
the south of us. And now it's a huge international

909
00:56:57,966 --> 00:57:01,554
airport that wins a five star international airport that wins great

910
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:05,186
awards 20 years, 30 years from now. Love to

911
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:09,026
envision what spaceport is going to look like because it's going to change the landscape

912
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,514
of that area with phenomenal engineering

913
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:16,454
jobs and opportunities and things of that nature. So keep

914
00:57:16,492 --> 00:57:20,282
up the good work, team, and look for bigger and better

915
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:24,534
things for you in the future. And I would also recognize

916
00:57:24,582 --> 00:57:27,802
Mr. Icken, who's very involved in your operations as well.

917
00:57:27,936 --> 00:57:31,920
Maybe you'd say too much. Right, Mario? Thank you.

918
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,846
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

919
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:40,302
Dismissed. We'll have a couple of oh,

920
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:44,194
by the way, council member Robert Gay goes joined us and

921
00:57:44,232 --> 00:57:45,570
now has another meeting.

922
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:53,250
Mr. Jason Oliver, I think, will be joining us virtually.

923
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:58,470
Star six. Yes. Good afternoon.

924
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:02,850
I'm really appreciative of the art I'm seeing throughout the airports,

925
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:06,946
especially local artists. I was in IH last week, and there's

926
00:58:06,978 --> 00:58:10,386
one artist, Kane Smith, whose tapestry doesn't have a nameplate.

927
00:58:10,418 --> 00:58:13,658
It's a small thing, but I just want to know who to contact

928
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:17,002
to make sure that's addressed, because I think it's important people know

929
00:58:17,136 --> 00:58:20,894
the artists whose work they're seeing. And then I guess

930
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:24,830
this question is toward Council Member Martin.

931
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:28,718
Many of us are really concerned about the procedural change,

932
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:32,154
removing the public's opportunity to speak publicly to city staff

933
00:58:32,202 --> 00:58:36,142
during these budget workshops. This is not consistent with previous

934
00:58:36,206 --> 00:58:39,906
years and is now our only opportunity to do so after the

935
00:58:39,928 --> 00:58:43,874
committee meeting. Policy change during the pandemic, which I hope will also be

936
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:47,506
reversed this change midway is a significant inconvenience for

937
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:51,254
those of us taking time out of our work day to participate. It seems

938
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:54,454
like this was your decision. Are you willing to resume the

939
00:58:54,492 --> 00:58:58,042
normal policy that we started this budget cycle with? And if not,

940
00:58:58,096 --> 00:59:01,814
please explain why public participation is being directly undermined

941
00:59:01,862 --> 00:59:04,650
this year. Thank you for your comments.

942
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:09,180
If public speaker has any questions,

943
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:13,178
the appropriate process is for those questions to be submitted

944
00:59:13,274 --> 00:59:16,506
to Share Point under your name through your council

945
00:59:16,538 --> 00:59:19,678
member. Thank you. Now, that was a

946
00:59:19,684 --> 00:59:22,858
question to you, Council Member Martin. Well, Jason,

947
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:24,640
I just answered it,

948
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:30,910
so that's enough. Next speaker,

949
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,170
we have Miss Sava Blanding.

950
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,488
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

951
00:59:41,584 --> 00:59:45,312
City council members. Last night, I had a conversation

952
00:59:45,376 --> 00:59:48,852
with my husband about the day's budget hearing, as one does,

953
00:59:48,906 --> 00:59:52,616
and I asked him how he would have responded, and he said, I would have

954
00:59:52,638 --> 00:59:56,436
asked, what are you afraid of? He commented on how there were only seven constituents

955
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:59,732
asking questions about HPD. Yesterday, the first department

956
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:03,144
finished 14 minutes ahead of time. If time was really

957
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,428
an issue, it is upon the council to keep everyone to time. However, there were

958
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:10,076
at least three to four repeat questions about Mowing schedules. In the middle of

959
01:00:10,098 --> 01:00:14,232
Rush public testimony, there was an unrushed conversation with another Houston Police Department

960
01:00:14,296 --> 01:00:18,124
employee. This is not about time. To have given public speakers

961
01:00:18,172 --> 01:00:21,344
a full three minutes would have only added 14 minutes,

962
01:00:21,462 --> 01:00:24,860
which the General Services Department's punctuality provided.

963
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,512
Why is the public not allowed more time? What would those 14 minutes

964
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:32,016
have cost the city, other than at least a humble nod to democracy?

965
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:36,256
Regarding the airports, what are plans to improve public transit

966
01:00:36,288 --> 01:00:40,084
to access the airports? And what are efforts to include and promote

967
01:00:40,132 --> 01:00:44,680
more local businesses in the airport system, such as local restaurants and local retailers?

968
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,872
Thank you. Ms. Blandy. Mr.

969
01:00:48,926 --> 01:00:52,300
Oliver had a question. 1.75% of

970
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,612
all of our vertical construction dollars go

971
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:59,512
to the arts within that facility. So percentage

972
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:03,310
1.75% of the total vertical spend

973
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,100
goes to the arts within an airport.

974
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,956
Your pictures, paintings, different types

975
01:01:10,988 --> 01:01:14,048
of things. Council Member Ed Pollard. Thank you,

976
01:01:14,054 --> 01:01:16,450
Chair. Thank you, Ms. Blanning, for coming. Again,

977
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,536
trying to get clarification on your statement

978
01:01:21,728 --> 01:01:25,524
question, as it pertains to

979
01:01:25,562 --> 01:01:29,472
the what are you scared? Part, is that directed towards council,

980
01:01:29,536 --> 01:01:31,990
as in why we aren't allowing more time?

981
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:37,332
Yeah, I mean, I understand time is an issue, and nobody

982
01:01:37,396 --> 01:01:40,936
loves punctuality more than me. If I'm running a minute, a meeting is

983
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:44,520
going to be like, 15 minutes. But we got 14 extra minutes because General Services

984
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:47,944
Department was punctual. And then it felt

985
01:01:47,992 --> 01:01:51,756
like I was watching people run out the clock because there were literally three

986
01:01:51,778 --> 01:01:54,840
to four questions that were exactly the same about Mowing schedules.

987
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,200
And then when it came to public comment and we're taking time out

988
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:01,600
of our day, it's 1 minute. We're rushed, we're not given

989
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:04,610
answers, and we're told just to submit it. What's the point of this?

990
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:08,470
We're supposed to be a democracy. Well,

991
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,444
I appreciate your comments. I think the main reason for everything is

992
01:02:13,482 --> 01:02:16,580
to get the public clarification on any questions

993
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,340
that you may have. And sometimes the questions

994
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:24,644
and the answers go above the time that we reasonably

995
01:02:24,692 --> 01:02:29,012
have. So we have the process in place that if the questions and answers

996
01:02:29,076 --> 01:02:32,888
aren't provided in a timely manner, then you can submit those questions.

997
01:02:32,974 --> 01:02:36,092
Because at the end of the day, as constituents, you all have

998
01:02:36,146 --> 01:02:39,724
rights to know any answer to any question that you may

999
01:02:39,762 --> 01:02:43,016
have. And so if the point is to ensure

1000
01:02:43,048 --> 01:02:47,330
that you get the questions answered, then we have that

1001
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,232
ability to do that. And so I don't want to get

1002
01:02:51,286 --> 01:02:55,136
caught up too much in the different systems and process, because we all

1003
01:02:55,158 --> 01:02:58,624
may have different opinions and perspectives on that. But if

1004
01:02:58,662 --> 01:03:02,230
your end goal is to ensure that you have more information

1005
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,564
and more clarity based on the questions that you may have,

1006
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:09,752
then we do everything we can as a council to provide those

1007
01:03:09,806 --> 01:03:10,970
answers to you.

1008
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,860
Council Member Jackson. Okay.

1009
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:22,026
Yes. Thank you. Saba I mean, that was one of my questions,

1010
01:03:22,128 --> 01:03:26,010
was we have the airport here in the police department.

1011
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,806
They should be able to answer the constituents questions. I would want to get my

1012
01:03:29,828 --> 01:03:33,150
questions answered. If I'm sitting here in this chamber,

1013
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:38,450
I would like to get the questions answered. So I would like to understand why

1014
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,082
isn't that possible? Can we next year schedule these

1015
01:03:42,136 --> 01:03:45,090
hearings for the workshops? An hour.

1016
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:48,466
Each department spend an hour to give people time to get

1017
01:03:48,488 --> 01:03:52,398
their answers. I'll let you get their questions answered. You and come

1018
01:03:52,584 --> 01:03:56,582
while I go through the next and you all can discuss it back there

1019
01:03:56,636 --> 01:04:00,994
away from the public. That's not appropriate for the public. We'll have Mr. Broder butler

1020
01:04:01,042 --> 01:04:04,140
next. Or I'll join you back there.

1021
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:14,408
Good afternoon. I have no direct

1022
01:04:14,494 --> 01:04:18,180
questions at this point in time in regards to the airport. I think that

1023
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:21,672
the Houston Airport does an above

1024
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:25,096
average job. In other words, it's not exemplary. But I am very proud

1025
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:28,940
of my airport. I've gone through many in this country. But I

1026
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,384
do have just one concern, and now I am getting

1027
01:04:32,422 --> 01:04:35,824
to a question. I'm from Northeast Houston, and I

1028
01:04:35,862 --> 01:04:39,984
would like since Houston first is an initiative, everything about this city

1029
01:04:40,022 --> 01:04:43,776
is an initiative. I would like to have asked the director, who is on the

1030
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:47,156
other side of the door and probably on the fourth floor now, what would he

1031
01:04:47,178 --> 01:04:50,372
do? Or could he put a program together to make sure

1032
01:04:50,426 --> 01:04:54,324
that since his airport is in District B, where I

1033
01:04:54,362 --> 01:04:58,612
come from, that he puts a program together to try to get employees

1034
01:04:58,676 --> 01:05:02,328
that live within a ten to 15 miles radius of

1035
01:05:02,334 --> 01:05:06,868
his airport to increase on time, to increase his workforce?

1036
01:05:07,044 --> 01:05:10,524
But I don't get a chance to answer that question because he

1037
01:05:10,562 --> 01:05:14,172
talked about being a visionary. He talked about doing things that would build

1038
01:05:14,226 --> 01:05:17,612
up this city. And unfortunately, unless somebody

1039
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:21,356
else can ask me about the vision of the director of the airports about

1040
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:24,992
hiring practices, I can't get that answer.

1041
01:05:25,126 --> 01:05:28,880
So he puts on a program twice a year. I believe it is

1042
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,932
out in that area because I live a little bit north of you and

1043
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:36,660
I forgot what he calls it. But it's an opportunity

1044
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:40,484
for prospective employer groups that

1045
01:05:40,522 --> 01:05:43,824
want to work for the airport to understand a little bit more

1046
01:05:43,882 --> 01:05:47,124
about that process and also the MWBE

1047
01:05:47,252 --> 01:05:50,836
process that should help those types of businesses,

1048
01:05:51,028 --> 01:05:54,136
also individuals who are looking for opportunities as

1049
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:58,010
well. So he does do that in conjunction with

1050
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:02,076
a number of folks within his airport. And I don't know where they

1051
01:06:02,098 --> 01:06:05,928
are today with it, but I'll try and find out because it just reminded

1052
01:06:05,944 --> 01:06:10,092
me because of COVID we haven't had many of those opportunities.

1053
01:06:10,156 --> 01:06:13,936
But it would happen literally twice a year that

1054
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:19,072
he would put on a convocave that had

1055
01:06:19,126 --> 01:06:23,184
those opportunities for individuals as well as businesses in

1056
01:06:23,222 --> 01:06:27,312
particular in that area. Well, thank you for the answer. With all due respect,

1057
01:06:27,456 --> 01:06:30,836
the marketing of that doesn't get out to the basic level of people.

1058
01:06:30,938 --> 01:06:34,368
But I would also like to extend an additional request,

1059
01:06:34,464 --> 01:06:37,620
if you could ask him if funds allow, if time allows,

1060
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,064
that he can increase it from two to four. In other words,

1061
01:06:41,262 --> 01:06:44,424
create a bigger net to cast more people. Because at this

1062
01:06:44,462 --> 01:06:47,816
point in time, using this great resignation,

1063
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:51,580
you still got to bake the donuts, right? Do me a favor.

1064
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:55,132
Send my district email, district e at

1065
01:06:55,186 --> 01:06:58,444
houstontx. Gov an address so I have

1066
01:06:58,482 --> 01:07:01,980
your email address and I will copy you

1067
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:05,500
on the email I send to Mario Diaz asking that particular question.

1068
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,776
One last note. You have a very exemplary staff every time I've interacted

1069
01:07:08,808 --> 01:07:13,316
with them. It's been a pleasure. Well, thank you for saying that. And there's one

1070
01:07:13,338 --> 01:07:15,910
of them sitting right here and I agree with you.

1071
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:22,580
That concludes public speakers for Houston Airport system.
