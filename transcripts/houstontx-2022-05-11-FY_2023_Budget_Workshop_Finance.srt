1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,030
Okay, so now we move into your budget presentation.

2
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,720
You thank you.

3
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,714
I'll be quick. So this is the budget presentations for Finance

4
00:00:33,762 --> 00:00:34,550
Department.

5
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,320
You should have a handout in front of you.

6
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:48,246
Before I begin the first slide, please let

7
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:51,706
me quickly introduce the key players in the Finance Department. I know you've

8
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:55,386
met William Jones. You may already interacted

9
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:58,986
with some of these excellent team players in this Finance

10
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,390
Department supporting me in leading this department.

11
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,570
I just want to make sure we have the slides.

12
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,866
Okay, well, while we're waiting on

13
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:14,402
that, I know you have your handout. That will be slide two.

14
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:17,746
In your handout, we have six divisions in

15
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:21,042
the Finance departments. Again. From the director's office,

16
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:23,480
we have Bernita Jones. I don't know if she's here.

17
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,734
If not, so if I call your name, please do stand up

18
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:31,470
so that I don't have to look back. So we have Fernita

19
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,130
Jones, who of course you all met and very familiar who support

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,662
the Council's Office. We have Rochelle McHenry.

21
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:42,298
Anushi is here. Thanks Rochelle. She supported

22
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:45,786
the Houston fire departments. We also have William Bryan,

23
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:48,814
who support the Houston Information Technology. Thank you,

24
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:52,766
William. We have Sheila Murphy, who also supported the

25
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:55,360
business office in the finance department. Thank you.

26
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,926
The next division is Treasury Capital Management. Of course, you all know Melissa Dubovsky,

27
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:04,366
who's not here today. We also have financial planning

28
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:07,640
analysis. William Jones, who you've met.

29
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,374
The next one is the financial reporting and operations by

30
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:15,942
Are sheet. Just want to make sure you know the face

31
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:19,922
and the name together. And, of course, we have the strategic procurement

32
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:23,722
divisions. Jerry Adams. There you go.

33
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:27,226
Our chief procurement officer. And last but not least is the

34
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:30,880
Performance improvement, Jesse Bounds. If he's here,

35
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,846
the computer froze in the back. So just keep working. Okay,

36
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:38,270
so again, Finance Departments has two funds.

37
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,470
So we have the general fund for Citywide Surfaces

38
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,500
as well as the revolving fund,

39
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,086
which is a surface chargeback for financial services provided to certain departments.

40
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:55,122
So with that, we are moving to the next slide. Slide number

41
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:59,214
three, if you can, flip your page again on the Functional

42
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:03,126
Organization charts chart. In the general fund, the finance budget is

43
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:06,802
at 20.8 million with 116

44
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:10,442
FTEs in this. So again, you saw the

45
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:14,150
functional indirector's office from the Council Administration's,

46
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,570
legislative Analysis, TPIA Coordinations,

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,720
the Treasury Capital Management at 2.9 million.

48
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,554
This is the area that handles the capital budget,

49
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:30,394
planning, management, reporting and Analysis, the debt issuance

50
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,270
and Derivative monitoring,

51
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,330
economic Modeling and Projection, the City's financial alternative,

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,398
liquidity alternatives, tax and Revenues Management.

53
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:46,802
I know Melissa often would come before councils to give a presentation

54
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:50,950
on upcoming financial transactions. That division also

55
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,150
handles the OPEP and pension system analysis,

56
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,250
financial planning analysis. Budget at 2.5

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,994
million. Again, this is FTEs at 16. But as you

58
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:06,134
saw, we have very limited active

59
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:10,294
employees at this point. Again, that division handling

60
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:13,242
the citywide annual operating budget, the five year forecast,

61
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:16,746
providing revenues and expenditures projections. We have the monthly

62
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:20,686
financial reporting, mid year review, funds management and any ad

63
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,494
hoc financial reporting the next on the financial reporting operations.

64
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:28,046
So again, this is a broad mix of Citywat Accounting

65
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:31,246
and reporting operations from the Accounting Disaster

66
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:35,538
Recovery to Fixed assets Management, grants Management including

67
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:39,142
the trust Funds management and Accounts Receivable is

68
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,886
at $6 million. Budget at 29.2

69
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,774
FTEs. Strategic Procurement of course, as the name

70
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:50,194
implies, handling the Citywide procurement,

71
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:55,210
administrations Material Vendor Contract Management, peacock Administrations

72
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,202
budget at 5.9 million at 44.7

73
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:04,346
FTEs. And again we have the Performance Improvement

74
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,758
divisions in here at 440,000. This is the

75
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:11,086
Office of Innovations that deals with the citywide operational process

76
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:15,054
improvement from citywide data analytics to smart

77
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:18,930
city program management. Continuing on to the next

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,834
slide, which is the revolving fund. This is budgeted at

79
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:26,550
7.5 million at 60.2 FTEs.

80
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,462
Again this slide. It provides financial services

81
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:35,634
to fleet hits fire departments,

82
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:38,250
grants management for Housing department.

83
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,678
This fund also handles the Citywide Energy Financial

84
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:47,050
Management as well as accounts payable function for certain departments.

85
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,800
Director's Office budget at 1.4 million.

86
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,794
This is the Fiscal Administrators to oversee the financial management

87
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:58,522
for Hits and Fire departments. That includes the annual budget,

88
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:02,510
monthly financial report and any ad hoc financial analysis.

89
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,414
And in the treasury and Capital Management budget

90
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:10,530
at 267,000. This is only two FTEs in here

91
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,974
supporting client departments for Capital Planning and cost

92
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:18,850
benefit analysis. This is for Fleet

93
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,086
Hits and Fire as our

94
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:26,274
client departments for the Capital Management financial

95
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:30,060
planning analysis at 885.5 thousand.

96
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,554
This is at 5.3 FTEs. This is handling the

97
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:39,018
Energy Financial Management supporting the fleet Departments sorry,

98
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:42,634
Energy Financial Management for GSD and also supporting the Fleet

99
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:46,314
Managements in their operating annual budget and monthly financial

100
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:50,382
report. Strategic procurement at 1.3

101
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:53,934
million. We have 9.9 FTEs in here.

102
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:56,750
This is again supporting the procurement for Fleets,

103
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,850
Hits and Fire departments.

104
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,090
One thing I want to note on the financial reporting operations,

105
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,946
I don't know if I think I probably missed it. Financial reporting

106
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:10,802
operations at 3.6 million. This is handling the Invoice reconciliations

107
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:14,002
and payments for several departments including Hits,

108
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:18,150
Public Works, Fire Departments and Planning as well as the

109
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,086
payment on the Energy Management, that is the electricity and natural gas

110
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:25,306
bills that we have to pay as well as

111
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:29,094
the service chargeback processing including the EMS Billing.

112
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:31,260
That is all in this revolving fund.

113
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,440
Moving on to the next slide. Slide five

114
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,646
again. I'm just going to go briefly again. You all know what we do

115
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,166
in the Finance Department. This is the major services in the Finance departments

116
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:46,766
is managing the Citywide Debt and Capital Management budgeting

117
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:49,502
forecasting, citywide Energy Contracts,

118
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:53,534
financial Reporting and Auditing, grants Management Oversight,

119
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:56,978
Disaster Recovery as you're all aware, as well as

120
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,790
the Cdwat procurement.

121
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,962
Next slide on the statutory requirements

122
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,566
for service delivery. I want to

123
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,734
stress out, we do have to comply with the statute

124
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:16,102
requirements for what we do in the Finance Department, that is from ensuring compliance

125
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,562
with the Texas Tax Code and Propositions One

126
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:23,406
and H to make sure that the city present a balanced budget in

127
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:26,574
accordance with state law and financial policies. We also

128
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:30,394
have to follow the federal and state compliance, including the procurement

129
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:33,786
law that we have to out comply and also completion

130
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:37,106
of the annual financial and single audit, again to be in

131
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:40,898
compliance with the state and federal laws. So again,

132
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:45,562
any mismanagement of these functions will be impacting the cities tremendously

133
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:49,714
from uninformed decisions from you all and the mayor's procurement

134
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,350
failure that will impact the surface delivery and city operations,

135
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,602
to claw back the federal funds and even to defaulting of the city

136
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:02,298
debt. So it is important for us in our function in the

137
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:05,930
finance departments to comply with all of these laws for

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,210
the sustainability of the city's operations.

139
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,520
So let's start looking into the numbers at this point.

140
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,280
I know we don't have the slides. So again, slide seven.

141
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,462
So on the General fund, again, we have 2.1

142
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:25,746
billion. The bulk of the property tax and sales tax is in the

143
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:27,700
Finance Department's business area,

144
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,466
$2.1 billion general fund in fiscal year 23,

145
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:36,306
which is 51.5 million higher compared to

146
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:40,738
the fiscal year 22 estimates. That is about 2.5% increase.

147
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:44,486
I know we've went a great deal in the budget overview on the

148
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:48,426
property tax and sales tax as we

149
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:51,610
saw it initially. Again, to keep in mind,

150
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,082
property tax and sales tax alone is comprised about

151
00:09:55,136 --> 00:10:00,314
98.7% of the financial revenues in

152
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:03,934
the revolving fund. We have about 7.5 million in here, but again,

153
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:08,042
this is a surface chargeback so it is essential revenues as we recover

154
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:11,390
the cost of providing financial services to this department.

155
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,966
So the next slide, slide eight is going through the details

156
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:19,970
again. Again, as we mentioned, our property

157
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,642
tax is at $1.28 billion, reflect an increase of 48.9

158
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:28,214
million compared to fiscal year 22 estimates. Again,

159
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,462
this is based on the Propositions One and H and again,

160
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:34,726
this is based on the CPI inflation rate of

161
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:38,418
4.28% and 0% growth of

162
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:41,578
populations on the sales tax. Again,

163
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:45,014
we've covered this before, our sales tax revenues

164
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:48,826
is at $807,000,000, which is assuming no growth at

165
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,886
this point. Again, we continue to monitor. We've seen some upticks in fiscal

166
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:56,526
year 2022, but again, with so many uncertainties and

167
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:59,760
even going through the consultant review,

168
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,294
we felt that it's probably best to just keep it flat at this point because

169
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:07,154
of those uncertainties in the inflations for fiscal year 23

170
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:11,118
budget for mixed beverage taxes at 20.7 million reflects

171
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:15,010
about $570,000 increase from fiscal year 22 estimates.

172
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,082
Next slide, which is slide nine, this is the expenditure

173
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,960
site on the again,

174
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,666
a combined budget that we have in fiscal year 23 is

175
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,234
about 28.3 million. 20.8 million

176
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:35,962
is for General Fund and 7.5 of that is for

177
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,980
thank you revolving Fund.

178
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,510
So we'll go through the details in the next slide.

179
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,686
Slide ten thank you. So,

180
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,526
slide ten, this is just again the compositions on the

181
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:54,826
general fund for the personnel versus non personnel.

182
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:59,266
Again, personnel compress about 76% in

183
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:04,162
the general fund of 15.8 million and 24%

184
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:08,342
or 5 million is the non personnel of which if you look at the

185
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:11,782
pie charts on the right that comprise of

186
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:16,150
billing collections about 1.3 million. So that is the billing collections

187
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,682
where we pay for the Harris County tax office for the property

188
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:24,774
tax collected. We also have an audit, auditing contracts

189
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:28,342
1.6 million. This is with the auditing

190
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:32,186
contracts for the year end audit that we work closely with the

191
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,790
controller's office restricted account at 949,000

192
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,614
compressed about 19% and services which is 1.1

193
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:43,662
million. So this is where we have the printing costs, advertising costs,

194
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:48,062
parking rentals and so some of those consultants

195
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:51,346
happy with the outcome based budgeting for instance, is all in that services

196
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:54,946
category. So now we

197
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:58,658
look@the.net change from the fiscal year 22 current budget

198
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:02,642
on the next slide. So let's start with the operating budget

199
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:06,054
in fiscal year 22 started at 17.9 million.

200
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:10,086
Again with the adjustment as you saw in the general appropriation,

201
00:13:10,118 --> 00:13:13,574
we have restricted account, hope and health benefits adjustment

202
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:17,414
including the city council surplus for a one time adjustment that I graciously

203
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:21,158
thank you for Fernita Jones office. So our fiscal

204
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:25,002
year 22 current budget at this point with those adjustments at 19

205
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:28,750
million. So now moving on to the incremental increases

206
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,166
to come up with our fiscal year 23. So again,

207
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:37,634
that city council surplus is a one time adjustment. So we took it out this

208
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:41,074
budget, it does include funding for ten new positions. So I

209
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,810
did ask for funding for ten new positions in my departments.

210
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,190
This is to help assisting the Strategic Procurement

211
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,074
Grants offer site and also capital Management.

212
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:56,520
Again, with this federal money that we have, we need more

213
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,750
streamlined process and help in those procurement divisions

214
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,386
as well as the Grants offer site. And so with

215
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:08,950
that our changing from operating budget

216
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,362
from fiscal year 22 reflect about 5.8%.

217
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,854
Now I'm going to move on to restricted account and health benefits and hope pay

218
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:19,514
increases. So those contractual mandate increases

219
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:23,454
about 621,000. So in total our

220
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:27,326
budget increased by 1.6 million. So that comprised

221
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:31,182
about 8.6% from the fiscal year 22 current budget.

222
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,766
So those are the details that increase decrease from fiscal

223
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:39,270
year 22 to fiscal year 23 expenditures budget.

224
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,810
Next slide. Again, I mentioned this briefly

225
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,794
when we go through the net change again, our budget includes

226
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:52,106
for both General fund and revolving fund, includes funding for health benefits,

227
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,530
pension contributions and the 3% hope pay increases.

228
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,278
Again in general fund it does include funding for ten new employees,

229
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:03,390
new positions to keep up with the increasing workload.

230
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,646
This is dealing with the Strategic procurement and the grants management as well as the

231
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:10,622
capital and debt functions revolving fund.

232
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,890
Again, this is just to provide funding for

233
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,810
financial procurement and accounts payable receivable support to

234
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,746
hit Fleet and Fire, as well

235
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:25,886
as the energy management. Again, it's very straightforward.

236
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:29,222
I think that's the end of my presentations and I'm open for any questions.

237
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:32,710
Thank you, council Member Abby Cayman. Thank you,

238
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,326
Director Emo. Again, I just wanted to thank you for all

239
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:40,602
the work you and your team do, and even in other

240
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:44,550
efforts that we as council are undertaking,

241
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,674
we come to you and you're always willing to help us and support us.

242
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:51,466
So thank you for making our jobs a lot easier.

243
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:55,070
I'm going to be asking this question of every department.

244
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,618
Given the significant budget constraints

245
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:04,450
that the city continues to face, are there priority

246
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,450
items that your department is not going to

247
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,010
be getting in this budget?

248
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,140
If not be getting yeah,

249
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,520
thank you for asking that question. So, one thing's first.

250
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,960
With the Pandemic and a lot of the grants funding we have,

251
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,442
the first party I ask for the mayor, is to make sure that we have

252
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:34,506
enough resources to carry those reporting and making sure

253
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:37,450
that federal monies are spent in compliance.

254
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,578
So I am gracious enough to get those decisions funded,

255
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:45,034
as you see in this budget, and that includes the procurement

256
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:48,826
groups. Again, we handle city wide functions

257
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:53,474
in here from the grants offer side and the procurement. So I

258
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,866
think I don't have anything else at

259
00:16:56,888 --> 00:17:00,194
this point. Again, it may change because,

260
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:04,974
again, we've talked about great resignations and competitiveness

261
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:08,566
with the market. And I think, again, this is happening in all across the

262
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:11,974
board, that everybody's seeing that. And so I

263
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:15,234
may come then. But at this point, since this is the start of the fiscal

264
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:18,938
year, I have been graciously granted those

265
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:22,810
funding. Thank you, Council Member Ed Pollard.

266
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,962
Thank you, Mayor Pro Tim. And sorry if these questions

267
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:32,922
were asked earlier, but I just wanted to kind of get a general overview

268
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:37,242
for the public on just how financially sound stable

269
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:41,054
we are currently. I know we throw out a lot of numbers and

270
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:44,706
this is kind of a high level overview, but for the

271
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:46,900
general person that's just tuning in,

272
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,042
would you say that the city right now is financially sound?

273
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:55,140
Yes. So I just want to point out, so for

274
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,286
credit rating agencies to change

275
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:03,046
their outlook from negative to stable is a

276
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:06,146
great deal for the items

277
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:09,706
that the mayor had accomplished with the pension reform and

278
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:14,090
the OPEC reform. Those credit rating agencies really

279
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,860
recognize the leadership, including you all,

280
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,826
to managing the financials of the city of Houston. So, yes, we are

281
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:24,478
currently financially sound. Are there any specific shortfalls that

282
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:26,320
you see that we need to be aware of?

283
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,374
It depends on where we go, where the path we are moving

284
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:34,466
forward at this point. And I think that's why I stress enough about preserving this

285
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,940
fund balance, because we can be in the path that we should.

286
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,722
Has the administration identified specific

287
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:46,146
allocations regarding the ARPA dollars that will be

288
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,622
coming in that we need to be aware of. So I know I

289
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:53,826
mentioned to you about we have $160,000,000 of ARPA funding

290
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:57,474
in here. And I know Mayor mentioned

291
00:18:57,532 --> 00:19:00,714
about the use of the ARPA dollars for

292
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:04,554
the revenue losses in the next year. I know

293
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:08,122
there's other projects that have been

294
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:11,574
presented and I think you all have seen it as well. The ones if Houston,

295
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:15,358
for example, is part of the ARPA fundings and I

296
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:18,270
can give you the list, I think we have the ARPA website already open,

297
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,678
so we can give you those details. Well, I want

298
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:25,166
to thank you again as well for your leadership and your entire team.

299
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:28,926
Thank you for all the hard work and the long nights. We all appreciate

300
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:32,286
it. So thank you very much. Thank you. It means a lot. Council Member David

301
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:35,966
Robinson. Thank you, Mayor Protem. And following on the line of my two colleagues

302
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:39,566
with their last questions, I just want to say thank you for everything you're

303
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:42,630
doing. I think this is a good wrap up to the last two days where

304
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,374
we've heard from you, from the mayor in particular. And I know a

305
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:50,070
moment ago when you were acknowledging your staff, who we all feel very strongly about,

306
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,818
great job, everyone. You mentioned Vernita Jones, who was not in the

307
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:57,802
chamber at the time, and Vernita is here. So I just wanted to call

308
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:01,274
particular attention to her because she does a great job across the street

309
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:05,360
taking care of us and

310
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,122
our budgets for all our people. And to the point about impact

311
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:13,694
of the great resignation, I know she's had a lot of work

312
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:17,086
to do for a number of our offices. So I just wanted to ask

313
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:20,050
you one follow up question to that. I don't know if she heard it.

314
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,822
When she was absent, did you mean that you were zeroing out her budget?

315
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:27,542
Is that right? I find that hard to believe.

316
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:31,266
No. Okay. All right, thanks. Council Member Sally

317
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:34,646
Alcorn. Thank you. And good for you for

318
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:37,080
getting the ten new positions. I know you need them.

319
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,974
In the big book, you mentioned as one of your performance measures getting

320
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:45,786
in compliance with our financial policies 100%. I just see

321
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:48,666
that we're out of compliance on just two of them. One has to do with

322
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:52,010
internal controls and one on our credit rating.

323
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,626
Can you explain a little bit further about how we're going to come in compliance

324
00:20:55,658 --> 00:20:59,310
with that? I think on the structurally balanced budget stuff, it's in progress,

325
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,486
but those two were out of compliance. So can you talk about

326
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:06,814
that? Yeah. So keep in mind when we

327
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:10,882
have that and we keep our bar high, which is good.

328
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:14,354
When we did the financial policy, I think it was based on fiscal year

329
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:17,762
2014, if I'm not mistaken. And a lot happened

330
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:21,526
from fiscal year 2014 to now. So there was

331
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,438
a time when we did get downgraded and I can't remember which one. And I

332
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:28,086
think, like I said, we were having a negative outlook and so

333
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:31,274
now we're moving back up. So we are in the right path just by that

334
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:32,970
change from negative to stable.

335
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,862
Let's start the change of the credit rating does not come overnight.

336
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:43,146
So it takes some steps because they want to make sure how you run in

337
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:46,126
that year and then the next year then they will change it. And so now

338
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:49,278
the fact that we change from the negative to stable is good. So the

339
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:52,394
next hope is with all this preserve fund balance,

340
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:55,778
hopefully we would get those additional increase in the credit rating so that we

341
00:21:55,784 --> 00:21:59,102
can go back to the compliance compared to fiscal year 14.

342
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:01,250
On the risk assessment,

343
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,486
there was part of our budget reductions, to be honest with you, with the internal

344
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:08,774
audit, again, during fiscal year 14 to now, a lot of things happen.

345
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:12,194
The economy landscape has changed. So there was budget reductions

346
00:22:12,242 --> 00:22:15,734
on the internal audit, so there was out of compliance. So we

347
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:19,366
are going back to see what we can do to put it back

348
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:23,178
in the compliance state. Okay, great. And I have some questions on specific

349
00:22:23,264 --> 00:22:26,506
line items within general government and you're the appropriate person to

350
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:30,106
send those to correct? I mean, you can do that. I can tell

351
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:33,878
you the dollars on what so some of the operating

352
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:37,274
questions are probably will have to defer, but okay, we'll do those in writing.

353
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,730
Thank you. Thank you. And there are no other council members in queue.

354
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,870
And I made these comments yesterday.

355
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,014
The City of Houston budget is made up by the administration,

356
00:22:48,142 --> 00:22:52,014
you and your staff and the mayor and presented to us and we make amendments

357
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:55,714
to it. But our final vote is either yes or no. We either accept it

358
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:59,358
or we reject it. I think this budget is

359
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:02,742
in the best shape of any budget I dealt with in my nine years

360
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:06,294
here. And it's because of you and your team and the diligence that

361
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:09,642
we put forward a year ago when we saw sales

362
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:13,146
tax revenue and a lot of our revenue gone down and we

363
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:17,514
made some specific budgetary cuts and we

364
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:20,390
see the good of those. So thanks for your leadership,

365
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,474
always enjoy working with you and your deputy

366
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:28,126
directors, mr. Jones and Ms. Dabowski, and your entire team. You all

367
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:31,482
do a great job day in and day out in a tough environment

368
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:35,114
and thanks for everything you do. And I do believe this budget

369
00:23:35,162 --> 00:23:39,106
process is hopefully going to be one of the smoothest ones we see because of

370
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:42,306
some of the pain that you saw coming and you

371
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:46,054
made adjustments, you and your team. So thanks for that. We do have three

372
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:50,470
virtual public speakers. The first is Saba Blanding

373
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,830
star Six. Again, Ms. Blanding.

374
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,980
Star six. There you go.

375
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,790
Yes. Okay. There I'm unmuted. Can you hear me okay?

376
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,430
Yes. Wonderful.

377
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,666
I have a question kind of two sides of

378
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:15,654
probably the same coin. You mentioned the high number of Vacancies

379
00:24:15,702 --> 00:24:17,290
going into the budget cycle.

380
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,270
Why is retention an issue for your department beyond

381
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,510
the great resignation and how can we improve it?

382
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,666
And then kind of alongside that and maybe kindred

383
00:24:30,698 --> 00:24:33,902
to what council member came in, asked earlier. I'm just really

384
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:37,838
curious, in a perfect world, how many employees

385
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:41,426
does your department need ideally? Like what would be the

386
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:44,770
perfect number and what type of kind of similar

387
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,066
to this, what type of pay increases would there

388
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:52,418
be ideally? So I have a more pragmatic question about Vacancies

389
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:56,598
and retention and improving it and then just kind of I

390
00:24:56,604 --> 00:24:59,766
would like to know the ideal number of employees so we can

391
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:03,740
kind of know the difference between what's happening and what is needed.

392
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,998
Okay, so it's

393
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:12,186
an interesting question. Let's start with the Vacancies at this

394
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:15,726
point. So we

395
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:19,134
are in the general fund departments, and you've gone through

396
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:22,750
the budget presentations with our limited revenue sources.

397
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,870
And so we have to continuously looking for efficiencies

398
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,362
and process improvements in the finance and city

399
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:34,722
department. Citywide, what happened

400
00:25:34,776 --> 00:25:38,050
with the Pandemic? I think it changed and I think you probably know this too,

401
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,290
it changed the landscape of the global mindset

402
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,654
of employees and employer too, right?

403
00:25:45,772 --> 00:25:49,094
So some private sectors can

404
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,662
provide those flexibilities that we don't at the city of Houston,

405
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:56,554
right? Because the work is different. We have people who

406
00:25:56,592 --> 00:25:58,890
have to be here meeting citizens.

407
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,700
And the pay the market study,

408
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,818
again, it's hard to compete

409
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:11,694
with the private sectors. Of course, when you do a market study, you compare with

410
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:14,270
the same government, municipal employees.

411
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,720
And so we continuously looking at that. And of course it's a

412
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,786
vicious cycle, if I can say. The more work you do, the more burned out

413
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:26,654
you are, and then the more you are looking for other position elsewhere.

414
00:26:26,782 --> 00:26:30,406
And so that's what happened. Retentions at the same time, because you don't have

415
00:26:30,428 --> 00:26:34,662
enough people and you are overworked pay

416
00:26:34,716 --> 00:26:38,280
increases, an ideal number of people.

417
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,422
And I can go back on the previous years

418
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,746
when we don't have any all of these cuts and to see what those

419
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:49,562
numbers are, you're probably looking at back in 2010 or

420
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:53,602
I mean 2008, if anything. Right. And I have to look at this FTEs

421
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:57,550
number. But those are difficult

422
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,274
situations to handle at this point, especially when you deal with the competitiveness

423
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:05,230
with the market. Thank you, jason Oliver,

424
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,298
before, there has been conversation about

425
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:21,522
unmet needs I'm really kind of interested in

426
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:24,726
because some departments come up and they say we're not able to do X,

427
00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:28,626
Y and Z because of the limitations or because of the cuts that we've

428
00:27:28,658 --> 00:27:32,154
made. And I'm less clear on how that

429
00:27:32,272 --> 00:27:35,606
is working with the finance department. So I'm

430
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:39,674
interested and I'm curious about these kind of unmet needs for

431
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:43,542
finance. And then you had talked about a market study

432
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:47,006
comparing to municipal employees. You said that

433
00:27:47,028 --> 00:27:50,414
we had kind of leveled out legal. And I'm wondering if

434
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:53,914
we are competitive if we're looking at municipal

435
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:58,050
finance employees. And I wanted to circle back to the

436
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,046
outcomes based budgeting because I'm

437
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:06,130
interested in if it's possible, like will you modify

438
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,638
your you had talked about changing your budget calendar during the

439
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:13,542
last presentation, so I'm wondering if you'll be

440
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:16,722
modifying it to better incorporate public input.

441
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:20,598
For example, many cities hold public workshops both before

442
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:24,934
and after a proposed budget is released to really get the community knowledgeable

443
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:29,114
about what's in there and make sure that their priorities are included. So three

444
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:32,586
things. First is unmet needs. Second, competitive based

445
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:36,426
on municipal employees. And then third, about modifying

446
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,822
the budget calendar as we shift to outcomes based

447
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:42,894
budgeting. Can you say the first one again?

448
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:46,560
Unmet needs. Unmet needs. Okay,

449
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,058
thank you. So again, I mentioned in some of my slide on the

450
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:55,460
finance departments, what we do in the finance department is

451
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,334
a lot of that is actually compliance with the state

452
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:05,254
and federal regulations. Right? You're talking about the

453
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:09,346
procurement, talking about, again, the debt

454
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:13,714
management making sure that we are not mismanaging

455
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:17,494
those and you don't want to have any stations when we are at the default.

456
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:20,714
At this point, the budget, which is again is

457
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:25,214
governed in the state and local policies and

458
00:29:25,252 --> 00:29:27,950
again the grants disaster recovery.

459
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,382
What we do is essentially essential to the city.

460
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:36,294
And so I cannot say that I would not be meeting

461
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:40,478
those functions because it's

462
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:44,050
a must in that sense. So,

463
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,180
yeah, I cannot say that I cannot meet any demands because

464
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,270
the function that we do are directly affecting

465
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,134
out of compliance of the city to the state and

466
00:29:58,332 --> 00:30:01,506
local charter. So the impact

467
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:04,554
is maybe, I don't know, maybe a late payment if that is the case.

468
00:30:04,592 --> 00:30:07,962
But of course it bites you back because then you have to pay

469
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,242
late fees. For example, going back to your

470
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:14,598
comment, it's not unmet needs, but I probably will have a delay if I don't

471
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:17,822
have enough people in the procurements. But you don't want to have a

472
00:30:17,876 --> 00:30:21,242
wrong product being delivered or you don't want to have a wrong scope

473
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:25,834
being written. So again, those expertise

474
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:29,778
in my area is very crucial because what we do is going

475
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:33,586
to be affecting the entire city's operations. So I

476
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:37,570
cannot stress enough the city wide functions that our departments handles.

477
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,342
So the last comment you have is the outcome based budgeting we will

478
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:45,926
have. And I think Mr. Jones had mentioned to you we

479
00:30:45,948 --> 00:30:49,430
do have the Plan Houston process, and I think

480
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,962
the input that we want from the public is the priorities. Exactly what

481
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:56,700
do you want to see the city spend the dollars?

482
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,082
The outcome based budgeting is just a vision on how

483
00:31:01,216 --> 00:31:04,874
it's going to look like. But I think the key that you are trying to

484
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:08,666
get is the input of the public for those priorities.

485
00:31:08,858 --> 00:31:12,494
And I believe that is already in place. But I can double check, but those

486
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:15,600
are the priorities that need some input from the public.

487
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,570
Thank you. Next speaker is Mr. Doug Smith.

488
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:29,202
Thank you. I just want to go back to a question I asked earlier that

489
00:31:29,256 --> 00:31:32,846
didn't get answered. We received

490
00:31:32,878 --> 00:31:36,342
$300 million of ARPA funds and we're going to get another

491
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:40,022
300 million. And the first 300 million was used

492
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:43,986
last year. And then this coming budget, if I understand correctly,

493
00:31:44,098 --> 00:31:48,118
but you're addressing the budget gap does not take into consideration

494
00:31:48,294 --> 00:31:52,086
the next 300 million that we're going to receive. So that's

495
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,690
one question. And then is there somewhere

496
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,806
how you calculated the property tax? Because when I

497
00:31:59,828 --> 00:32:03,790
look at the projected increase, it's 3.9%

498
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,454
over 2022. And I thought the state

499
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:11,310
law and I don't know the state law, but I thought the state law mandated

500
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,026
a three and a half percent increase. So I would like to see how

501
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:18,420
that calculation was done. And finally,

502
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,770
in the raw data under other interfund

503
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,594
services, which I understand you explained well, there's revenues

504
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:29,238
of $7,400,000.

505
00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:33,250
And where does that revenue appear? If it does appear

506
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,874
in page 625 where

507
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:38,810
you list all of your revenues,

508
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,114
those are my questions. Okay.

509
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:46,666
So I think correct me if I'm wrong if I get it right,

510
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,366
your questions. The ARPA dollar that we are

511
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:54,960
receiving or to be received is $607,000,000.

512
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,054
About $303,000,000 has been received last May.

513
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:03,280
Another 303,000,000 will be received sometimes this month.

514
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,398
This includes the allocations of ARPA

515
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:12,238
of 160,000,000 at this point. That came from the first tranche,

516
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:14,360
which is $303,000,000.

517
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,254
Great. Yes. Thank you. That's what I thought. And the

518
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:22,626
next 300 million, you did not take that into consideration

519
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:25,922
when you talked about addressing the budget gap.

520
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:29,366
You said that you didn't include that in what the proposed gap

521
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,018
might be. Is that a correct statement? So the next

522
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:36,554
tranche, again, we have the one safe Houston. We have other stuff that has already

523
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:40,358
been included in the ARPA. And I

524
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:44,222
know I included projected gap for fiscal year 24,

525
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:47,854
with the hope is to also use the ARPA money then. But again,

526
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:51,058
that will be from the second tranche. Correct me if I'm

527
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:53,762
wrong. ARPA funds can be used until December 31,

528
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:57,074
2023. 424. Got it.

529
00:33:57,112 --> 00:34:00,818
So 24. Okay. For us,

530
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:04,294
yes. The second questions you have is on,

531
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:07,270
I believe is it on the property tax calculations?

532
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,870
Yes. Because you're showing a projected 3.9%

533
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,122
increase. And I thought that new state law

534
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:19,740
mandated a three and a half percent increase. And I just like to understand

535
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,410
how that plays against our own property

536
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,500
tax cap.

537
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:38,046
So I know our proposed budget is including the 4.28%

538
00:34:38,148 --> 00:34:42,350
increase of the CPI,

539
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:46,014
but remember, we also have the 90 million on the Prop

540
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:49,762
H. And I can go back to you again to

541
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:53,750
reconcile the 3.97%

542
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,766
versus the 4.23 of the CPI number, but some

543
00:34:57,788 --> 00:35:01,634
of that could be from the Prop

544
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,946
H. Okay, well,

545
00:35:04,988 --> 00:35:08,458
okay. What about the state cap is three. And a half percent.

546
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:10,700
How does that play into this?

547
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,586
I will have to get back to you on

548
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,254
those details on the calculations. I think there's also some

549
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:24,414
other annexations maybe included in the fiscal year 22

550
00:35:24,612 --> 00:35:27,738
budget. Again, annexation is only when it's

551
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:31,374
available and only for twelve months. You don't use annexations every single year.

552
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:35,214
So maybe some other stuff in the fiscal year 22 estimates.

553
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,686
Just a reminder of any additional questions. If you want to send to District

554
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:41,938
E at houstontx Gov, we will answer them and get back to

555
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:45,814
you. A reminder to the council members council members should

556
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,206
submit any department budget workshop questions in a Word document and

557
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:53,334
we'll upload that to SharePoint and departments have been

558
00:35:53,372 --> 00:35:57,414
directed to provide responses within 48 hours of the conclusion

559
00:35:57,462 --> 00:36:01,354
of their presentation. Department responses will also be

560
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,842
uploaded on SharePoint and give us two minutes

561
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,102
and we'll transition. And my apologies to Chief Pena,

562
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,526
Chief West and Ms. McHenry for the delay.

563
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:14,730
I'm sure your presentation will be worth it.

564
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,266
So thank you. We will transition and Vice Chair Ed

565
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:21,380
Pollard will be sitting here two minutes.
