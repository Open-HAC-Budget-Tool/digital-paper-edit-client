WEBVTT

00:04.250 --> 00:08.026
At this time, I'd like to welcome Director Marsha Murray

00:08.058 --> 00:11.562
and Pat C. Jackson to give us the presentation

00:11.626 --> 00:14.602
on Office of Business Opportunity budget.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.818
Presentation. Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

00:17.914 --> 00:20.622
Is my mic on? Yes, ma'am. Okay.

00:20.756 --> 00:23.998
Good afternoon, mayor Pro TEM, Vice Chair and Council members,

00:24.084 --> 00:27.862
I'm pleased to present OBO's proposed fiscal year 23

00:27.916 --> 00:31.266
budget today. I'm joined today by OBO's Chief

00:31.298 --> 00:35.074
Financial Officer Patsy Jackson. I'd also like to recognize

00:35.122 --> 00:38.614
some of the OBO team members that are here today. Lala Morris

00:38.662 --> 00:42.390
Obio's assistant director, as well as Pearl Cahalas,

00:42.470 --> 00:46.170
our council liaison and Pio.

00:46.670 --> 00:50.518
In his absence, I'd also like to acknowledge Tim Warren, who's our Certification

00:50.694 --> 00:54.606
and Designation Division Manager, and two supervisors who

00:54.628 --> 00:57.438
are overseeing our Contract Compliance Division at this point,

00:57.524 --> 01:00.766
Shanita Petway, as well as Jamante Huey. I thank you

01:00.788 --> 01:04.606
all for your fabulous work, your tremendous work in moving the core

01:04.638 --> 01:07.966
services of the Office of Business Opportunity forward. Next slide,

01:07.998 --> 01:11.858
please. At the Office of Business Opportunity,

01:11.944 --> 01:15.586
we execute our mission of cultivating a competitive and diverse economic

01:15.618 --> 01:19.682
environment and the City of Houston by promoting the success of small businesses

01:19.746 --> 01:23.714
and developing Houston's workforce, with a special emphasis on historically

01:23.762 --> 01:27.138
underutilized businesses and disenfranchised individuals

01:27.234 --> 01:30.700
through the provision of several core services. Next slide, please.

01:32.590 --> 01:36.410
This slide represents our organizational chart. Fund 1000

01:36.480 --> 01:40.306
covers OBO's core services, including executive Oversight,

01:40.438 --> 01:44.046
Certification, contract compliance, and External affairs and

01:44.068 --> 01:47.786
workforce development. Accounting for our $5.4 million

01:47.818 --> 01:51.386
budget and approximately 43 FTEs.

01:51.578 --> 01:55.214
The Executive Leadership team includes myself, the Assistant

01:55.262 --> 01:58.894
Director, our Chief Financial Officer, the Citywide Title VI

01:58.942 --> 02:02.274
Compliance Coordinator and our one person analytics and

02:02.312 --> 02:05.874
reporting team. Our Certification and Designation Division

02:05.922 --> 02:09.186
administers six local certifications and two federal

02:09.218 --> 02:12.914
certifications on behalf of the US. Department of Transportation.

02:13.042 --> 02:16.002
Those certifications are listed here. In addition,

02:16.066 --> 02:19.786
we facilitate historically underutilized business certification on

02:19.808 --> 02:23.286
behalf of the State of Texas, and our newest certification

02:23.478 --> 02:27.206
added to our directory is the Lgbtbe certification.

02:27.398 --> 02:31.218
The Division also processes applications for the city's local preference

02:31.254 --> 02:35.146
program. The Higher Houston First program, the Contract Compliance

02:35.178 --> 02:39.114
Division, monitors all city contracts with the exception of housing and airport

02:39.162 --> 02:42.506
contracts, to ensure compliance with the minority Women's Small

02:42.548 --> 02:46.926
Business Enterprise program requirements and to enforce local and federal

02:46.958 --> 02:50.974
labor standards, including prevailing wage compliance and prompt payment requirements

02:51.022 --> 02:54.370
on city contracts. Our External Affairs team

02:54.440 --> 02:58.226
raises awareness of OBO services and the city's contracting

02:58.258 --> 03:02.274
opportunities and also provides local businesses with access to business development

03:02.322 --> 03:05.826
resources. This team also administers business development

03:05.858 --> 03:09.526
and capacity building programs. And finally, our Workforce Development

03:09.558 --> 03:13.302
team facilitates initiatives such as the Turnaround Houston job in a Readiness

03:13.366 --> 03:14.860
Fair. Next slide, please.

03:16.510 --> 03:19.994
So this slide represents our Special Fund, Fund 24

03:20.032 --> 03:23.694
24, which covers the Contractor Responsibility Fund,

03:23.812 --> 03:27.466
which supports the administrative and programmatic operations of the city's.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.718
Payer Play Program The Payer Play Program aims to

03:30.724 --> 03:34.398
level the playing field for contracts between bidders that choose

03:34.484 --> 03:38.274
to offer health benefits to their workforce and those who

03:38.312 --> 03:42.082
do not. The program also offsets the cost of providing health care

03:42.136 --> 03:45.262
to uninsured people in the Houston Harris County area.

03:45.416 --> 03:48.978
The Contractor Responsibility Fund supports three city programs

03:48.994 --> 03:51.714
and those programs are listed on this slide. Next slide,

03:51.762 --> 03:55.350
please. So, in the interest

03:55.420 --> 03:59.174
of time, I will ask you to review at your election slides

03:59.222 --> 04:02.442
five and six, which provides more details about our core services.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.500
I'll skip over to slide seven.

04:13.330 --> 04:16.766
So, while we do have some flexibility in terms of

04:16.788 --> 04:20.410
delivering OBS core services, there are statutory requirements

04:20.490 --> 04:24.930
for components of our services at the local, state and federal levels.

04:25.270 --> 04:29.074
Federal funding is tied to our Title Six certification and

04:29.112 --> 04:32.334
contract compliance work. As it relates to certification,

04:32.462 --> 04:36.142
federal regulations require that all recipients of Department of Transportation

04:36.206 --> 04:39.654
funding in excess of $250,000 in

04:39.692 --> 04:43.634
a federal fiscal year are required to have a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise

04:43.682 --> 04:47.646
program to ensure nondiscrimination in the award and administration

04:47.778 --> 04:50.742
of Department of Transportation assisted contracts.

04:50.886 --> 04:54.314
Failure to properly administer the aforementioned programs can

04:54.352 --> 04:57.654
result in a loss of Federal funding. Next slide,

04:57.702 --> 04:58.300
please.

05:02.050 --> 05:06.042
So, this slide we are describing the financial and societal impact

05:06.106 --> 05:09.854
of our service deliveries. The services that OBO administers have

05:09.892 --> 05:14.522
broad societal impact for not only small business owners, but also their employees.

05:14.666 --> 05:18.094
Obio's contract compliance team advocates for and enforces

05:18.142 --> 05:21.822
the rights of certified firms on contracts with goals, and ensures

05:21.886 --> 05:25.702
that employees of City of Houston construction contractors are

05:25.756 --> 05:29.410
paid appropriate wages, ultimately supporting the local economy

05:29.490 --> 05:33.058
and improving the lives of Houstonians. Revenues collected

05:33.074 --> 05:37.646
from the Paraplay program offset the cost of providing health care to uninsured

05:37.698 --> 05:40.950
Houstonians. The City's Title Six program ensures

05:41.030 --> 05:44.474
equal access to city facilities and program in by all

05:44.512 --> 05:47.894
Houstonians. And our certification program serves to expand

05:47.942 --> 05:51.438
opportunities for firms as they can be utilized on City of

05:51.444 --> 05:54.874
Houston projects and on projects with other area agencies

05:54.922 --> 05:58.814
and private companies. Some of those companies or

05:58.852 --> 06:01.946
entities are listed at the bottom of this slide. Next slide,

06:01.978 --> 06:06.046
please. And this slide

06:06.158 --> 06:09.874
discusses the anticipated growth in number of customers that we

06:09.912 --> 06:13.422
expect in fiscal year 23. We expect an increased

06:13.486 --> 06:16.966
demand for MWSBE certification due to new

06:17.068 --> 06:20.978
MWBE programs in the region, such as the Harris County

06:21.074 --> 06:24.178
and Poor Houston race and gender conscious programs.

06:24.274 --> 06:28.078
We also expect demands from businesses seeking to participate

06:28.194 --> 06:32.006
in the Houston based NCWA Final Four Supplier

06:32.038 --> 06:35.350
Diversity Initiative next year. And we also anticipate

06:35.430 --> 06:39.130
that there will be additional opportunities for firms

06:39.890 --> 06:42.350
brought on by infrastructure projects.

06:45.490 --> 06:48.798
HPW has also predicted that there will

06:48.804 --> 06:52.814
be an increase in the number of contracts that are

06:52.852 --> 06:57.294
let. As a result, we anticipate an increase in our overall contract compliance

06:57.422 --> 07:01.394
monitoring workload. And finally, the Northeast Water

07:01.432 --> 07:06.294
Purification Plant Project has approximately 931

07:06.332 --> 07:09.874
project 930 subcontractors participating

07:10.002 --> 07:14.306
and growing. This project will increase our MWSBE

07:14.418 --> 07:19.206
contract compliance monitoring and prevailing wage and labor standards monitoring.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.874
Next slide, please. So at this time, I will ask

07:22.912 --> 07:26.394
Ms. Jackson to discuss the projected revenues and expenditures in our

07:26.432 --> 07:30.246
proposed FY 23 budget on our revenue

07:30.278 --> 07:33.626
by funds. The General Fund revenue indicated on the first row

07:33.658 --> 07:37.594
of this slide increased by 74% and FY

07:37.642 --> 07:41.294
23 over FY 22. The special revenue on the second

07:41.332 --> 07:45.454
row increased by 7.94%, and FY 23 over FY

07:45.502 --> 07:49.602
22. Let's go to the next slide and give a little bit more information about

07:49.656 --> 07:53.694
that. These are our revenue highlights. The FY

07:53.742 --> 07:57.430
23 General Fund proposed budget increased by 74%

07:57.500 --> 08:00.946
is due to the three additional FTEs transferring from the Houston

08:00.978 --> 08:04.994
Public Works Department. This revenue consists of HPW's

08:05.042 --> 08:08.102
contributions to support our contract compliance staff,

08:08.166 --> 08:11.322
which currently funds nine positions. The General

08:11.376 --> 08:15.194
Fund revenue supports the City's Payer Play program,

08:15.312 --> 08:19.674
the FY 23 budget increased by 7.94%

08:19.792 --> 08:23.294
and it is attributed to anticipated increases to the revenue that

08:23.332 --> 08:27.466
supports Fund 24 24. Of note, though, Houston Public Works estimate

08:27.498 --> 08:31.054
a 6% increase in revenue due to an increase of

08:31.092 --> 08:34.418
vendors participating in the pay portion of the pay or

08:34.424 --> 08:38.654
play program working on the new project. Houston Airport

08:38.702 --> 08:42.830
System anticipate projects moving from design to construction phase,

08:42.910 --> 08:46.034
and more contracts awarded using the pay option

08:46.152 --> 08:49.462
will result in increased revenue, and the Housing and Community

08:49.516 --> 08:53.526
Development Department anticipates more contracts in FY 23 which

08:53.548 --> 08:56.326
will increase revenue by 15% to 20%.

08:56.508 --> 08:57.800
Next slide, please.

08:59.610 --> 09:02.666
Expenditure by Fund Obio's FY 22

09:02.688 --> 09:06.650
General Fund estimate budget for Fund 1000 is 4.1 million.

09:06.800 --> 09:10.506
The 5.4 million proposed budget for FY 23 reflected on

09:10.528 --> 09:14.298
this slide shows a 32.58% increase due

09:14.314 --> 09:17.790
to two additional position in OBO Solutions Center, which will manage

09:17.860 --> 09:21.130
new business programs and increase the visibility of the Department

09:21.210 --> 09:24.942
services. Three employees transfer from HPW

09:25.006 --> 09:29.406
to the Contract Compliance Division to assist in managing the HPW contracts,

09:29.518 --> 09:32.706
two additional positions for the certification division and a

09:32.728 --> 09:36.374
onetime funding for vendor augmented contract monitoring to

09:36.412 --> 09:40.310
ensure compliance with statutory requirements. The special

09:40.380 --> 09:43.766
revenue expenditure line item reflects expenditures for

09:43.788 --> 09:47.266
administrative and pragmatic operations of the City's payer

09:47.298 --> 09:50.730
play program. This fund shows a 31.30%

09:50.800 --> 09:54.806
decrease because the one time funding in FY 22 for ethan Houston

09:54.838 --> 09:58.870
Fire Department personnel is not included in FY 23 budget.

09:59.030 --> 10:02.814
In FY 23, this fund supports funding for health benefits,

10:02.932 --> 10:06.394
pension contribution and municipal employees contractual

10:06.442 --> 10:10.350
pay increases funded to maintain an electronic management system

10:10.420 --> 10:14.094
to effectively track all pay or play activities. The FY

10:14.142 --> 10:17.678
23 budget continues to support the contractor responsibility

10:17.774 --> 10:21.220
funds initiatives such as the Client Access Program,

10:21.910 --> 10:25.258
crisis called Diversion Program, and the Emergency Telehealth

10:25.294 --> 10:28.520
and Navigation Ethan program. Next slide, please.

10:29.450 --> 10:33.478
Why FY 23 personnel versus nonpersonal for Fund 1000

10:33.644 --> 10:36.774
OBO's proposed budget of 5.4 million,

10:36.972 --> 10:39.814
82% of that covers personnel expenses,

10:39.862 --> 10:43.334
salaries and French benefits. Of the remaining

10:43.382 --> 10:47.222
18% of our budget, 4% covers restricted

10:47.286 --> 10:50.962
charge accounts that are charged backs by the City of Houston,

10:51.046 --> 10:55.086
1% covers the cost of the B City Certification and

10:55.108 --> 10:58.634
Contract Compliance Management system, and 13% covers

10:58.682 --> 11:02.240
other services including the contract monitoring program,

11:02.770 --> 11:06.322
the printing and reproduction, professional development and training

11:06.376 --> 11:08.740
for our employees. Next slide please.

11:09.430 --> 11:13.086
Slide 14, which is the FY 23 personnel versus nonpersonal

11:13.118 --> 11:16.910
for fund 24. 24 covers the Contractor Responsibility Fund,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.150
which supports the operations of the City of Houston payroll play program.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.474
15% of that budget will fund personnel expenses

11:23.522 --> 11:27.550
such as salaries, fringe benefits for the administrative responsible

11:27.650 --> 11:31.674
for the financial and program oversight. The other 85%

11:31.712 --> 11:35.606
of the budget will fund the three listed program and technology costs.

11:35.718 --> 11:36.940
Next slide, please.

11:38.910 --> 11:42.638
Slide 15 is our FY 23 budget expenditure net Change.

11:42.804 --> 11:46.560
This slide is a visual representation of the net change

11:46.930 --> 11:50.846
and general fund budget that we discussed earlier. Go to

11:50.868 --> 11:54.774
the next slide, please. Slide 16

11:54.842 --> 11:58.322
and 17. They both details what we discussed early in our

11:58.376 --> 12:01.806
presentation. And that concludes our financial portion

12:01.838 --> 12:06.018
of OBO's budget, and I will refer that back to our director. Thank you.

12:06.184 --> 12:09.686
And thank you. And that concludes our presentation. Before I take questions,

12:09.788 --> 12:13.446
I'd like to briefly highlight the appendix that follows, which you can

12:13.468 --> 12:16.998
review at your election. The appendix provides additional information,

12:17.084 --> 12:20.614
including Oba's organizational chart, a breakdown of staff

12:20.662 --> 12:24.106
demographics, Obia's FY two accomplishments which

12:24.128 --> 12:27.274
we're very proud of, and some of our unmet needs.

12:27.392 --> 12:30.486
Thank you, Council Member

12:30.518 --> 12:33.646
Ed Pollan. Thank you, Chair, and thank you,

12:33.668 --> 12:37.434
Director, for your presentation and to your entire staff

12:37.562 --> 12:40.990
for all the great work that you all do. I know you make the most

12:41.060 --> 12:44.190
with a little, and it's appreciated and valued.

12:44.270 --> 12:47.982
A couple of questions. We had a Disparity

12:48.046 --> 12:51.586
study done, correct? We did. How much was that

12:51.608 --> 12:55.300
Disparity study? Why are we not using that Disparity study?

12:56.170 --> 12:59.720
And in the Disparity study, is it breaking down

13:00.730 --> 13:03.990
opportunities based on specific race?

13:04.650 --> 13:09.050
Okay, so we did commission a Disparity study that

13:09.120 --> 13:13.466
will not be published. I'm sorry. Is it are

13:13.488 --> 13:17.340
we good? Okay, so the city did commission a Disparity study,

13:17.790 --> 13:21.706
and because there are concerns about the

13:21.728 --> 13:25.374
methodology that was used to perform the Disparity study, the city

13:25.412 --> 13:29.198
will not be publishing that study. So I cannot speak

13:29.364 --> 13:33.006
about any of the substantive how long was that Disparity study covering?

13:33.038 --> 13:37.170
What years did it cover? So it's covered twelve through 16

13:37.670 --> 13:41.966
fiscal years, 1230 fiscal

13:41.998 --> 13:45.490
years. Twelve through 16. And how much money did we spend on that?

13:45.560 --> 13:49.014
It cost a little bit under a million dollars. And we're not

13:49.052 --> 13:52.440
publishing it at all? No. And so now,

13:53.290 --> 13:56.806
to my understanding, we are looking to do another Disparity study.

13:56.908 --> 14:00.794
So there's currently an RFP that is

14:00.832 --> 14:04.314
on the street soliciting proposals for

14:04.352 --> 14:09.882
a new Disparity study covering fiscal years through

14:10.016 --> 14:13.642
fiscal year 17, through fiscal year 21, a five year period,

14:13.706 --> 14:17.950
and who makes a determination on whether the methodology was something

14:18.020 --> 14:21.200
that we believe is useful or not.

14:21.970 --> 14:25.602
So the determination is really based

14:25.656 --> 14:29.934
on the experience with administering programs

14:29.982 --> 14:33.666
like this, particularly the kind

14:33.688 --> 14:37.000
of program that we have. Without going into

14:37.850 --> 14:41.574
substantive details about what's contained within that

14:41.612 --> 14:44.774
draft study. It really did not.

14:44.812 --> 14:48.038
I believe in the memo that I wrote to the mayor that was shared with

14:48.124 --> 14:51.706
council members. I believe I included in that memo that

14:51.728 --> 14:55.674
it really did not reflect the way in which the

14:55.712 --> 14:59.306
City of Houston administers its program. You put me back

14:59.328 --> 15:03.178
in the queue. Thank you. Vice Mayor Pro TEM martha

15:03.194 --> 15:06.254
Castex Tatum. Thank you, Director Murray. Thank you for your

15:06.292 --> 15:10.202
presentation. I'm curious to know, last budget cycle,

15:10.266 --> 15:14.338
we put forth a budget amendment for some additional dollars

15:14.424 --> 15:17.250
to get caught up on our contract compliance.

15:17.670 --> 15:21.406
Where are we in that process, and have we made any progress

15:21.518 --> 15:24.750
with getting caught up on our contract compliance?

15:24.910 --> 15:28.166
So I am happy to report that the mayor has, as part

15:28.188 --> 15:32.306
of the fiscal year 22s budget, he's actually provided additional funding

15:32.418 --> 15:36.722
for us to actually augment and our our existing contract

15:36.786 --> 15:40.906
compliance monitoring services through the engagement of vendors. So additional information

15:41.008 --> 15:44.294
will be provided shortly about that engagement,

15:44.342 --> 15:47.914
because as is the case with other

15:47.952 --> 15:52.814
departments, we're certainly not immune to the

15:52.852 --> 15:56.094
great resignation. And so we have lost a

15:56.132 --> 15:59.470
substantial number of our compliance officers,

15:59.890 --> 16:03.154
which is why there has been this urgency to

16:03.192 --> 16:07.314
actually augment our existing services. Unfortunately, we've only been

16:07.352 --> 16:11.854
able to, and we're just having issues attracting compliance

16:11.902 --> 16:14.770
officers. So we had seven compliance offers.

16:15.590 --> 16:19.014
We're now up to two compliance officers. So really,

16:19.052 --> 16:23.046
the rest of the remaining of the staff is really all hands on deck in

16:23.068 --> 16:26.514
terms of trying to address the workload that currently exists.

16:26.642 --> 16:29.340
What's the pay for a compliance officer? So,

16:30.110 --> 16:34.250
for a compliance officer, it's approximately 48,000.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.980
For a senior compliance officer, it's approximately 56,000,

16:39.630 --> 16:43.594
and the qualifications for it. And so the compliance

16:43.642 --> 16:48.094
officer requires a bachelor's degree and

16:48.132 --> 16:51.486
one year experience, or years of experience can

16:51.508 --> 16:55.214
be substituted year for year for the bachelor's degree. For a senior compliance

16:55.262 --> 16:57.780
officer, the difference is two years experience.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.650
Okay. Thank you, Council Member Ed Pollard.

17:02.550 --> 17:05.894
Thank you, Chair. Sometimes when we

17:05.932 --> 17:09.494
have contracts that come out, we're looking

17:09.532 --> 17:13.814
for MWBEs to participate, but we

17:13.852 --> 17:17.862
get word that there aren't any in the directory or there's a void for

17:17.916 --> 17:21.098
minority vendors in that particular industry space.

17:21.264 --> 17:24.822
Do we keep a log of where we may have voids

17:24.886 --> 17:28.490
and try to find ways to identify minority companies within

17:28.560 --> 17:32.014
the city that if we were to

17:32.052 --> 17:36.650
reach out to them, could participate in certain contracts?

17:36.810 --> 17:40.586
So we're not necessarily keeping a log, but we are aware

17:40.618 --> 17:44.740
of some of the areas where there are

17:45.670 --> 17:49.346
gaps. So when our external affairs team actually goes on

17:49.368 --> 17:52.626
to the community, they may actually emphasize the

17:52.648 --> 17:56.102
fact that there are opportunities in a particular area and

17:56.156 --> 17:59.650
encourage for firms to get certified.

17:59.730 --> 18:03.670
And we are generally just looking to increase the number

18:03.740 --> 18:07.570
of firms and the variety, the diversity in terms of industry,

18:07.650 --> 18:10.250
the diversity of firms that are actually certified.

18:11.390 --> 18:14.460
And when it comes to the openings that you have,

18:15.790 --> 18:19.258
so those are current openings that people can go online right now

18:19.344 --> 18:22.986
and apply for those positions. Yeah. Any opening

18:23.018 --> 18:27.034
that we have that has not been closed because we've

18:27.082 --> 18:30.366
exhausted the period for which the posting is out absolutely are

18:30.388 --> 18:34.094
available on the City's website. We do, actually, because we recognize

18:34.142 --> 18:38.078
the challenges in reaching

18:38.094 --> 18:41.854
out to people. So we have social media. My external affairs team has created

18:41.902 --> 18:46.066
social media campaigns. We have leveraged our advisory

18:46.098 --> 18:49.462
board members to actually reach out to their

18:49.516 --> 18:53.094
network of folks to talk

18:53.132 --> 18:56.598
about our various positions. We are perpetually talking

18:56.684 --> 18:59.926
ad nauseam about these positions. And we've

18:59.958 --> 19:03.626
also been just internally talking about reevaluating some of

19:03.648 --> 19:07.770
the postings that we put out there. We certainly want to be clear about

19:07.840 --> 19:12.140
what the responsibilities of the position, but we also want to talk about the benefits,

19:13.150 --> 19:16.526
lead with the benefits of working for the city, lead with the benefits of the

19:16.548 --> 19:20.094
impact. That the kind of work that you can do as a compliance officer can

19:20.132 --> 19:23.346
have on the lives of people. But I think you all do a tremendous job

19:23.368 --> 19:27.186
of putting out information. I'm always getting updates. I think we as

19:27.208 --> 19:30.594
a council should collaborate more on making

19:30.632 --> 19:32.660
sure our constituents have that information.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.838
So whatever information you do have on current

19:36.924 --> 19:40.680
openings, please send to my office. Sure. Thank you.

19:41.930 --> 19:45.414
So just a quick follow up on Council Member Pollard's initial line

19:45.452 --> 19:48.794
of questions on the Disparity study. So we

19:48.832 --> 19:52.934
issued an RFP. We got it. We received the answers,

19:53.062 --> 19:56.406
we paid them a million dollars. We received

19:56.438 --> 19:59.980
the information, but we're doing nothing with it

20:00.750 --> 20:04.334
at this point. It's not going to be published. We haven't paid the full amount

20:04.372 --> 20:07.998
of the contract. What have we paid of the million dollars? I'm sorry?

20:08.084 --> 20:11.710
What have we paid of the million whatever it was? Probably 900

20:11.780 --> 20:15.474
and change. So we had $900,000 we paid for

20:15.512 --> 20:18.798
Disparity study, and correct me if I'm

20:18.814 --> 20:22.114
wrong. We define the scope because

20:22.152 --> 20:26.002
we issued the RFP. So in an RFP, you define the scope of your

20:26.056 --> 20:29.446
project. And if you define the scope of your project

20:29.548 --> 20:33.046
as to, here are the particular questions. Here's the

20:33.068 --> 20:36.566
information we want to look at. And they give us that.

20:36.668 --> 20:40.570
And it has nothing to do with how we define the process,

20:40.720 --> 20:44.042
then we shouldn't pay them a penny. If they did

20:44.096 --> 20:47.722
follow it and gave us information that the data probably

20:47.856 --> 20:51.226
came back and we didn't like it, then we should pay them

20:51.248 --> 20:54.830
and we should release the data. And let us judge as to

20:54.980 --> 20:58.814
was it effective or not, because I point back and I

20:58.852 --> 21:03.050
say we had a process that we followed. We didn't identify

21:03.130 --> 21:06.050
the scope. If they gave us the incorrect answers,

21:06.950 --> 21:10.594
if we did identify the scope of the RFP and they

21:10.632 --> 21:14.094
answered it based upon our scope check, if they didn't,

21:14.142 --> 21:17.726
they shouldn't get a penny. So while I can't

21:17.758 --> 21:21.574
delve into the substantive details of this, this is really a legal matter at this

21:21.612 --> 21:25.286
point. I do want to say that it's not a matter of not liking the

21:25.308 --> 21:28.946
final results. And certainly we do define

21:28.978 --> 21:32.442
the scope. What we don't dictate is methodology. That actually

21:32.496 --> 21:36.730
has to be something that's independently decided

21:40.050 --> 21:43.246
by the consultant. It's a little bit more

21:43.268 --> 21:46.634
nuanced and then taken into account the existing

21:46.682 --> 21:51.802
programs that actually exist for us. But I'm

21:51.866 --> 21:55.746
most comfortable deferring questions about the disparity study to our

21:55.768 --> 21:57.700
legal department. Fine.

21:59.190 --> 22:02.690
I understand. Pay for play. There's another

22:02.760 --> 22:06.662
component that we include into the bid process that

22:06.716 --> 22:09.958
awards points, and I forgot what it's called to companies

22:10.044 --> 22:13.350
that are headquartered here in the city. Hire Houston first.

22:13.420 --> 22:16.834
Hire Houston first. So Ed Pollard answers

22:16.882 --> 22:20.326
the RFP and Dave Martin answers the RFP.

22:20.518 --> 22:23.926
Ed Pollard. Pollard. I'm assuming the objective

22:23.958 --> 22:27.834
of that is to get taxpaying dollars. More of an

22:27.872 --> 22:32.246
opportunity to participate in our business. Ed Pollard

22:32.358 --> 22:35.626
lives in the city. He works for his company here that's

22:35.658 --> 22:38.974
based here. He has five employees. Dave Martin lives

22:39.012 --> 22:42.606
in the City and Dave Martin has 600 employees that live

22:42.628 --> 22:45.922
in the city of Houston. But yet he gets ten points

22:45.976 --> 22:49.662
on a bid and I get zero. So if the objective

22:49.726 --> 22:53.006
is to give opportunities to people, taxpayers,

22:53.118 --> 22:56.786
then why do you look at that information and give him the

22:56.808 --> 23:00.454
points? I've always had a big problem in our RFP process

23:00.572 --> 23:03.830
with this because we have a number of companies

23:03.980 --> 23:07.706
that are great companies in the city that employ a lot of

23:07.728 --> 23:11.242
people that they lose bids on those ten

23:11.296 --> 23:15.238
points, but yet they have an enormous employee

23:15.334 --> 23:19.210
force that lives in the city, that are taxpayers and

23:19.280 --> 23:22.750
derive a lot of benefit. But we give it to the small company

23:22.820 --> 23:26.110
who has a third of those employees.

23:26.690 --> 23:30.446
I know it was passed by council years ago, but why can't we

23:30.468 --> 23:34.046
look at that? Because that fundamentally seems very unfair to me.

23:34.148 --> 23:37.874
So I do want to say that hire Houston first. The designation which

23:37.912 --> 23:40.740
my office administers is not based on size.

23:41.110 --> 23:44.850
Really? The criteria is that headquarters? I'm sorry?

23:44.920 --> 23:48.466
Headquarters. That's what it's based on, correct? It's what isn't it based on? Headquarters.

23:48.498 --> 23:51.926
Sorry to interrupt. It's actually based on principal place of business.

23:52.108 --> 23:55.206
We have headquarters as an option, or 20% of

23:55.228 --> 23:59.526
their workforce is actually locally based, but it's not a size driven

23:59.718 --> 24:02.822
designation. So the City has made a determination

24:02.886 --> 24:06.522
that for those companies that have actually gone

24:06.576 --> 24:10.426
through the designation process and are declared as a local business or

24:10.448 --> 24:14.426
a city business, that if they're competitive,

24:14.618 --> 24:16.800
there's a leg up in the bidding process.

24:18.050 --> 24:22.078
So do you think that was it? Higher Houston First

24:22.164 --> 24:26.146
is a fair and equitable program within the

24:26.168 --> 24:30.386
confines of what we do, it is. But what we have found,

24:30.568 --> 24:34.494
I will say that our local companies are actually very competitive.

24:34.622 --> 24:37.974
So our analysis on an annual basis, we do publish a Higher

24:38.012 --> 24:41.314
Houston First report, which we've been publishing for several

24:41.362 --> 24:45.222
years, actually shows that our local companies are

24:45.276 --> 24:48.954
securing contracts without the application of the Higher

24:48.992 --> 24:53.514
Houston First designation. But it's there as

24:53.552 --> 24:57.050
a safety net in the event. They're not competitive

24:57.470 --> 25:00.926
on their own. For the investments, for the promoting the kind of

25:00.948 --> 25:04.410
investments that you described earlier, isn't it a 10% variable?

25:04.490 --> 25:08.318
I'm sorry? Isn't it a 10% on an RFP process? Isn't it a

25:08.324 --> 25:09.550
10% equation?

25:12.850 --> 25:16.494
Depending on the type of bid it is, I think it's like two to 3%

25:16.692 --> 25:20.530
as long as you're within two to 3% of the lowest bid. Good.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.606
So all my career, I've worked for a big firms that weren't

25:24.638 --> 25:28.114
headquartered here. And we competed against really small firms,

25:28.162 --> 25:31.958
and we had 600 people and they had five. And I always

25:32.044 --> 25:35.702
felt that that was a very unfair deal to give

25:35.756 --> 25:39.046
them the points, because sometimes we

25:39.068 --> 25:42.906
may have lost business. I don't know. But I always thought if your

25:42.928 --> 25:47.130
really objective is to give the opportunity to taxpayer citizens,

25:47.630 --> 25:51.034
wow. Figure out how many you have that live here, pay taxes

25:51.082 --> 25:54.720
here, and then compete against them and let the

25:55.170 --> 25:58.430
numbers tell that story. But I'll get off my soapbox.

25:59.410 --> 26:01.760
I'll be quiet over to Tiffany D.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.100
Council Member Abby Cayman's office.

26:07.670 --> 26:11.090
Good afternoon, Director. Mary. I have just one question

26:11.160 --> 26:15.086
on behalf of Council Member Cayman. Due to the financial and budgetary constraints

26:15.118 --> 26:18.162
the city continues to face from revenue limitations,

26:18.306 --> 26:22.070
are there critical needs that your department are not able to address

26:22.140 --> 26:25.926
at this time? And if there are, what are they? So, as I

26:25.948 --> 26:29.898
mentioned earlier, we certainly struggling in

26:29.904 --> 26:33.420
the contract compliance realm. And so the mayor is offering us

26:34.910 --> 26:38.954
funding, us actually contracting out some of our

26:39.072 --> 26:42.986
augmenting our existing contract compliance monitoring

26:43.098 --> 26:45.840
services for a period of time.

26:46.770 --> 26:50.750
We have performed analysis of how many people we do need

26:50.900 --> 26:53.742
to perform contract compliance,

26:53.806 --> 26:57.486
effective compliance, on a long term

26:57.518 --> 27:01.054
basis. And the numbers are actually pretty high. And that's actually included

27:01.102 --> 27:04.754
in the appendix. While we currently have

27:04.792 --> 27:07.926
seven compliance officers, we are anticipating that

27:07.948 --> 27:12.194
we need about 30 to 37 compliance officers.

27:12.242 --> 27:14.310
We have been working with HPW,

27:15.050 --> 27:19.206
and Ms. Jackson actually described

27:19.238 --> 27:23.046
some transfers that have been made, personal transfers

27:23.078 --> 27:26.666
from the HPW department to facilitate some of

27:26.688 --> 27:30.638
our compliance functions. But at this point, we're not

27:30.804 --> 27:34.170
certainly the help that we'll receive via vendors

27:34.330 --> 27:37.726
will be great, but long term, we do need to

27:37.828 --> 27:41.310
augment our increase our staffing.

27:44.150 --> 27:47.330
Okay, Director Murray and Ms. Jackson, we have four public

27:47.400 --> 27:51.154
speakers who are all in person here. And the first one we have

27:51.192 --> 27:53.730
is Mr. Oliver, Jason Oliver.

27:56.460 --> 27:59.944
He's the director of our Mic Communication Today and doing

27:59.982 --> 28:04.280
a great job of it. I'll send you my invoice.

28:06.860 --> 28:10.296
So management consulting has increased dramatically. I'm just trying to

28:10.318 --> 28:14.284
figure out if that's where the contract compliance is showing up. Is that

28:14.402 --> 28:17.404
what's happening there? The management consultant? Is that where we put this?

28:17.442 --> 28:20.892
It's about 520? Yes. Okay. That's what I thought.

28:20.946 --> 28:25.410
Okay. Just making sure you had talked about the 48,000

28:26.980 --> 28:31.116
for the contract compliance. How does that compare to peer peer

28:31.148 --> 28:35.056
roles? And then the third question

28:35.158 --> 28:38.896
that I want to ask is about the crisis Call diversion funds

28:38.928 --> 28:42.484
that were approved and allocated last year. I know that kind of falls under

28:42.602 --> 28:46.372
your purview. Those are just now being put into use.

28:46.426 --> 28:50.072
Can you talk about the delay in implementation there and kind of what

28:50.126 --> 28:53.544
factors into that? Because it seems like the need for

28:53.582 --> 28:57.224
those diversionary calls is significant, particularly during

28:57.262 --> 29:00.650
the pandemic. Okay. Patsy, do you want to discuss

29:01.260 --> 29:05.784
the crisis call diversion program was already being sponsored

29:05.912 --> 29:09.772
through another source. We were just asked to

29:09.826 --> 29:13.456
start to fund that source starting in 2021.

29:13.558 --> 29:17.152
So it had already been funded before. It didn't just now start.

29:17.286 --> 29:19.810
We just start to become a part of it.

29:20.820 --> 29:24.884
So it's been affected before. Okay, so that

29:24.922 --> 29:28.244
ARPA funding that's being used for that has been

29:28.282 --> 29:31.776
actualized or it's not actually being used. I'm unclear

29:31.808 --> 29:35.536
on what that means. So we're

29:35.568 --> 29:38.816
not going to be poised to discuss any kind of ARPA funding

29:38.848 --> 29:42.836
as it relates to that program as this fund focuses on the revenue

29:42.868 --> 29:45.560
that's collected via the Pay option of Pay or play.

29:45.710 --> 29:49.104
Got you. Okay. And as far as contract compliance,

29:49.252 --> 29:53.212
the competitiveness of our

29:53.266 --> 29:57.340
salaries, we have done ad hoc analyses

29:57.760 --> 30:01.488
looking at other compliance officers in

30:01.494 --> 30:05.036
the state, particularly Austin. And I know that our assistant director

30:05.148 --> 30:08.704
just came back from a conference where she

30:08.742 --> 30:12.444
spoke with other practitioners compliance

30:12.572 --> 30:16.356
contract compliance practitioners and certainly discovered that our

30:16.378 --> 30:18.900
salaries are not, in fact, competitive.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.470
Surprise, surprise. Thank you. Thank you,

30:23.960 --> 30:27.850
Sarah. Blanding. Blanding. I'm sorry.

30:29.820 --> 30:33.352
Hey, thank you so much for all you do with so

30:33.406 --> 30:36.680
little. And I'm just going to keep

30:36.750 --> 30:40.216
talking about these compliance specialists because I've been obsessed with them since you

30:40.238 --> 30:43.660
all did your presentation last year. I couldn't believe how many

30:43.730 --> 30:47.150
we needed versus what you all actually had to operate with.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.584
And I appreciate that there's been an effort for some sort of stop

30:51.622 --> 30:52.960
gap in the meantime,

30:55.140 --> 30:58.876
and I appreciate to know that the salaries

30:58.908 --> 31:02.000
are not competitive. Unfortunately, I'm not surprised.

31:02.420 --> 31:05.884
I guess my question is, what do you need in order to expand

31:05.932 --> 31:09.024
to the adequate number of compliance specialists to address our city's

31:09.072 --> 31:12.244
needs? I'm just concerned there has not been a strong

31:12.282 --> 31:15.972
effort to address it. And I guess that's honestly a side comment to the City

31:16.026 --> 31:18.920
Council, and I'd love to see some budget amendments.

31:20.380 --> 31:23.992
So I'm just curious what you all need, like what that dollar amount would be

31:24.046 --> 31:27.764
to actually get that 30 to 37 in a competitive

31:27.812 --> 31:28.680
salary.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.384
Ideally, we would have all senior Business Development Coordinators,

31:35.432 --> 31:39.036
because I would say that the level of work really rises to a

31:39.058 --> 31:42.320
senior compliance level on a daily basis.

31:42.740 --> 31:46.300
And I'm not really fantastic at multiplication,

31:46.380 --> 31:50.064
so I'd say $58 to $60,000

31:50.182 --> 31:53.836
times the number of persons

31:53.868 --> 31:57.750
that are actually needed, the 30 to 37.

31:58.440 --> 32:02.148
All right, thank you. Adding to the two that

32:02.154 --> 32:05.828
we already have, that's 2.1 million. Just if anyone wants to write that down,

32:05.914 --> 32:09.636
got it. Thank you. Council Member Ed Pollard. Thank you,

32:09.658 --> 32:13.624
Chair. The county recently did a Disparity study,

32:13.742 --> 32:17.336
did they not? They did. It was published, I think, maybe about a little

32:17.358 --> 32:20.116
bit over a year, a year and a half ago. Do you know the firm

32:20.148 --> 32:22.830
that they used to do their Disparity study?

32:23.360 --> 32:27.564
Do I know the firm? Are you familiar with the firm? I am.

32:27.762 --> 32:31.340
Is it the same firm that we used? It is. Okay.

32:31.490 --> 32:34.732
And so we use the same

32:34.786 --> 32:38.124
firm as them. They publish theirs. We're not publishing ours.

32:38.172 --> 32:40.800
But we spent almost a million dollars.

32:40.950 --> 32:44.208
My issue with it is we keep talking about

32:44.294 --> 32:47.728
we have budget restraints or we don't

32:47.744 --> 32:51.252
have the money to pay for employees or whatever the case may be

32:51.386 --> 32:56.224
across the board. But then we have a vendor who answered

32:56.272 --> 32:59.496
the solicitation. We paid them almost a million dollars, but we're not

32:59.518 --> 33:02.984
going to release the report when the county used

33:03.022 --> 33:06.648
the same vendor for their report,

33:06.734 --> 33:10.796
which actually highlighted a lot of the deficiencies that they had in their

33:10.978 --> 33:14.348
program. I don't even think they had a program. Right. So I

33:14.354 --> 33:18.030
do think while, again, I don't want to get into

33:18.640 --> 33:22.492
the details of necessarily the issue

33:22.546 --> 33:26.124
here, I do think it's important to note that the county

33:26.172 --> 33:29.628
did not have a program. So you're starting with a clean slate.

33:29.724 --> 33:33.692
And so the analysis of a nonexisting program and

33:33.766 --> 33:38.276
contracting patterns versus a program that's actually been around since 1984

33:38.298 --> 33:42.724
and the nuances of such a program is

33:42.762 --> 33:47.160
material to how our Disparity studies actually conducted.

33:48.300 --> 33:52.504
Thank you. So, Vice Chair legal's budget presentation is

33:52.542 --> 33:56.360
Thursday at 01:00. And guess who will be sitting in the captain's chair?

33:56.700 --> 33:59.900
You. So ask that question on Thursday.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.580
Ms. Joe Groch.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.996
Grochell did? Good the first time, bad the

34:08.018 --> 34:11.684
second. My apologies. How are you? Apology accepted.

34:11.752 --> 34:15.164
Thank you, ladies. So I understand your mission

34:15.212 --> 34:18.876
is to convulse to cultivate a competitive and diverse

34:18.988 --> 34:20.640
economic environment.

34:22.180 --> 34:26.692
My question to you is, with $1.7 trillion

34:26.746 --> 34:30.960
in college debt and many people questioning the value of a college degree,

34:31.120 --> 34:34.564
are efforts being made to eliminate college from many

34:34.682 --> 34:38.516
job requirements by promoting skills for, quote,

34:38.548 --> 34:42.024
unquote, new collar jobs? So we're not

34:42.062 --> 34:46.372
specifically engaged in efforts to eliminate college. Our workforce development

34:46.516 --> 34:50.332
team is actually focused on just

34:50.386 --> 34:54.060
providing information about different

34:54.130 --> 34:57.836
career pathways for Houstonians. Okay,

34:58.018 --> 35:00.510
thank you. Okay. Thank you,

35:01.940 --> 35:03.280
Mr. Butler.

35:11.140 --> 35:14.336
Good afternoon, Director. I want

35:14.358 --> 35:17.744
to talk about what could be compared to what you've guys been talking about,

35:17.782 --> 35:21.536
of what is that will sort itself out. But I'm from northeast

35:21.568 --> 35:25.504
Houston, and in my opinion, business creation has been lacking

35:25.552 --> 35:29.300
for where I reside. So thus it's the number one issue

35:29.370 --> 35:33.864
for me and the residents where I live. So I'm curious if

35:33.982 --> 35:37.864
there is any possibility going forward in

35:37.982 --> 35:41.092
an evolution not this budget,

35:41.156 --> 35:44.324
next budget, but there are three things that I was wondering

35:44.372 --> 35:48.044
if you could say, I see it in the stars or.

35:48.162 --> 35:51.724
No, we're not structurally able to do it. The first

35:51.762 --> 35:55.116
one is to launch a business incubator or accelerator in

35:55.138 --> 35:58.828
conjunction with the HCC North Forest campus

35:58.924 --> 36:02.496
that exists in my community. Also to create an

36:02.518 --> 36:05.964
Office of Research and Evaluation charge with studying barriers

36:06.012 --> 36:09.510
to wealth and business development in communities of color.

36:09.880 --> 36:13.204
Lastly, establish an Office of Advocacy and

36:13.242 --> 36:16.564
Intergovernmental Affairs to score the

36:16.602 --> 36:20.472
effects of proposed legislation and regulations on

36:20.526 --> 36:24.570
barriers to minority owned small business creation and success.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.872
So for the last, establishing the Office

36:28.926 --> 36:31.976
of Advocacy, that is definitely not something that I

36:31.998 --> 36:34.956
can commit to. But I think for all three, what I can say to you

36:34.978 --> 36:38.232
is that we welcome partnerships

36:38.376 --> 36:42.136
to explore these areas that you've

36:42.168 --> 36:45.836
actually pointed out, to see how we on our own with

36:45.858 --> 36:49.400
our existing resources. I don't think this is something necessarily that we

36:49.410 --> 36:52.912
can do all three, but I think in partnership with others, we can actually

36:52.966 --> 36:56.016
support some of the objectives of those three items that

36:56.038 --> 36:59.408
you just listed. Right. It was a conversation about growing into

36:59.494 --> 37:02.492
oneself compared to being that tomorrow.

37:02.636 --> 37:05.888
Understood. Thank you. Okay, thank you. And thank

37:05.894 --> 37:09.232
you, Director Murray. And Ms. Jackson. Appreciate your insight. Thank you.

37:09.286 --> 37:10.050
Thank you.
