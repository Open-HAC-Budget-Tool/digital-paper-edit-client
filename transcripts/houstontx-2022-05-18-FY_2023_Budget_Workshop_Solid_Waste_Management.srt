1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,786
Presentation. And we will now move on to the budget workshop for Solid

2
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:04,990
Waste Management.

3
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,780
Okay, thank you.

4
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,326
Good afternoon, everyone. Mark Wolffolk, Solid Waste Department.

5
00:00:41,438 --> 00:00:45,066
Six months in. I just wanted to put that cat out there so you

6
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,186
all go easy on me today, all right?

7
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:51,898
Also want to thank our staff for getting me to this point.

8
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:55,642
I just mentioned, been here six months, but everybody's been working

9
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:59,038
together. The Synergy has been great, but I just want to

10
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:02,814
go ahead and throw another caveat out there on this presentation today.

11
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:06,414
You're dealing with two rookies, right? So I'm here.

12
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:10,562
I'm also flanked by our assistant director. How many months

13
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:14,178
has it been? Two months. Two months?

14
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:18,590
Yeah. Assistant director, wealthy, white. So congratulations

15
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,110
to her. She's still hanging.

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,534
Okay, so we'll go ahead and just get into the budget

17
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:29,478
presentation. Apologize. I kind of

18
00:01:29,564 --> 00:01:33,106
broke the traditional format that you all follow, but I do want to concentrate

19
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:36,390
on the budget portion. So if we could go to the next slide.

20
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,370
I just wanted to give you all an overview of our executive leadership team here.

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,130
I think the key takeaway from this slide is that we have about

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,910
427 positions in the department.

23
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,526
And the other key takeaway from

24
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:56,586
this slide is and I mentioned earlier how the team has been working with Synergy.

25
00:01:56,778 --> 00:02:00,778
Our deputy director, Anthony Booy, that's here today. I like to recognize him.

26
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:04,834
This will be his last budget presentation. Go around with us. After 42

27
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:08,894
plus years, he's getting ready to retire. So definitely like to recognize

28
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:11,990
Mr. Anthony Booy for his contribution.

29
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,630
So we've got some big shoes to fill there.

30
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,186
So next slide, please. The demographic

31
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:24,394
data. Just wanted to give you just a little quick overview of that. Of course,

32
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:27,786
77% of that department is African American,

33
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:29,530
followed by Hispanic,

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,074
Latino, and then white and Asian. But to me,

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,706
the biggest takeaway of this is the diversity, gender diversity that we have

36
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:41,086
in the department and the amount of women that we have that

37
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:44,058
are doing the jobs today in solid waste management.

38
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:47,966
So I just really wanted to focus on that. That 29% to 30%

39
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:51,886
really caught my eye when I arrived to the city. And I think there's

40
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:54,450
just more good works to come. Next slide.

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,386
Just why do we have to have solid waste department? For these

42
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:04,414
three reasons. Right here you have the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965,

43
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:08,294
as well as the Texas Health and Safety Code, and of course, the city code

44
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:12,194
and ordinances. And of course, without effective solid waste management,

45
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:15,658
our neighborhoods would be overrun by all types of

46
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:19,750
vermin and really have deplorable conditions in the neighborhood.

47
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,606
Next slide. You're all familiar

48
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:26,982
with the forward facing departments that we have or forward facing

49
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:30,702
business units that we have. So I won't spend much time there, except for on

50
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:33,966
the last yellow highlighted area there.

51
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:37,482
In addition to all of the services that we provide on a weekly,

52
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:41,330
monthly or bimonthly basis. We also focus

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,006
hard on those other support services such as homeless

54
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:48,834
encampment abatement program, the litter abatement program, as well

55
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:52,146
as many of the council district service funds and keeping

56
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,950
those programs going as well. Next slide.

57
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,390
Okay, just a functional review of our organizational chart.

58
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,810
You'll see where basically we have three different

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,310
sections in the department. It's either going to be north operations,

60
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,450
south Operations, or Administration. And whatever

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,954
doesn't fall in there will also fall under

62
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:18,502
our maintenance category. But as you can see, the estimated

63
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,880
total for this FY 23 year will be about $95.6 million.

64
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,390
All right, next slide, please. At this point, I'd like to

65
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,060
turn this point of the presentation over to our CFO, Ms. Wealthy White.

66
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,534
Thank you, Director. The solid waste department revenues

67
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:41,654
are generated through two funds the general fund and

68
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:45,570
the recycling revenue fund. The General Fund revenues

69
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,650
includes fees from our dumpster permits,

70
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,046
our extra capacity container program, our nonresidential

71
00:04:54,098 --> 00:04:57,514
garbage and our container lease fee and some

72
00:04:57,552 --> 00:05:01,414
other small accounts. The Recycling Revenue

73
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:05,446
Fund is generated from the sale of recyclable materials

74
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:08,058
like glass, scrap metal,

75
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:11,760
batteries, electronics which are sold by the City.

76
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,094
Also included in this fund are fees from our

77
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:20,130
tire recycling and our business recycling programs.

78
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,338
On this slide, we see a projected 3%

79
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,854
increase in General Fund revenues due to the annual

80
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:31,922
CPI and prior year revenue activity

81
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:35,320
to be realized in fiscal year 2023.

82
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,602
There is no projected increase in the Recycling

83
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,254
Revenue Fund, and with these revenue funds, we have

84
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:47,340
a total budget revenue budget of $14.8 million.

85
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,046
Next slide, please. Our expenditures

86
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:56,426
by funds are our department,

87
00:05:56,538 --> 00:06:00,670
our collection programs and other service delivery

88
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,202
components. Includes our garbage collection, tree waste,

89
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,998
heavy trash depositories,

90
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:13,134
curbside recycling, drive through recycling

91
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:17,134
facilities, sponsorships. All these areas

92
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:20,778
are supported by the General Fund. And the fiscal

93
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:24,854
year 2023 proposed budget is $95.6

94
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:29,154
million, which represents a 1% increase

95
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:31,480
from the current fiscal year.

96
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,190
The Recycling Revenue Fund proposed expenditure

97
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,890
supports the City's recycling programs, related services

98
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,630
and recycling education. The proposed budget

99
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,214
for fiscal year 2023 is $4.1 million

100
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:52,974
and it represents a 5% increase from

101
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,282
fiscal year 2022. Next slide,

102
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:56,960
please.

103
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,530
Looking at go ahead.

104
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,124
Yeah, they're ahead. You can go ahead and explain if you can back up one

105
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:11,136
slide to the pie chart. Thank you. The projected budget

106
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:14,472
by fund for fiscal year 2023 in the General Fund

107
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:18,040
budget, personnel represents 41% of the total

108
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,648
budget. nonpersonal accounts for 59%

109
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:27,404
of the proposed budget, and within that 59% services

110
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:31,000
are 23%. And restricted accounts,

111
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,164
supplies, non, capital transfer and debt make

112
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:38,672
up the balance of 36%. In the

113
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:42,380
Recycling Revenue Fund, the percentage for personnel

114
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,032
is ten point 57 and nonpersonal is

115
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:49,584
89%. The next slide shows

116
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:53,216
the net change in the General Fund. Next slide,

117
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:54,550
please. Thank you.

118
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,052
At the start of fiscal year 2022,

119
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:03,992
the Solid Waste Management Department began with a budget of $89

120
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:07,624
million and with adjustments throughout the

121
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:11,384
year, it increased the budget to 95,

122
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:15,916
601, 576. Looking forward

123
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:20,120
to the fiscal year 2023 General Fund budget.

124
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,172
Additional adjustments were made to include contractual and

125
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:28,492
mandated adjustments resulting in a proposed budget

126
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:35,810
of $95,610,939,

127
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,424
which is again a net change of

128
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:43,024
approximately 1% from the current year's

129
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:47,220
budget. Next slide.

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,704
All right. Thank you, Ms. White. Now with this FY

131
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:56,184
23 proposed budget, we do expect some

132
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:59,544
impacts and a lot of those impacts are going to come just

133
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,996
by growth and demand, increasing growth in demand throughout

134
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:06,708
the city. We also expect some of those impacts

135
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:10,364
to be attributed to the vacancy rates that we currently have that we're working on

136
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:14,024
driving down overtime, as well as temporary

137
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:18,152
services that we'll use to mitigate some of the shortfalls that we incur

138
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:22,128
throughout the year. Operational program

139
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:25,596
subsidies will be another area that we think will also impact. And that's

140
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:29,392
just from observation of being here a little more than six months.

141
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:33,344
Meaning that we may at times have some a need to

142
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:36,644
supplement our services by calling in help from some of our

143
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:40,496
private counterparts in the industry that will be in the areas of heavy

144
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:43,352
trash collection which we're about to embark upon right now,

145
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:47,960
as well as curbside recycling. And then again,

146
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,256
we have challenges with addressing some of the neighborhood density projects that

147
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,376
are going on and some of the inflationary contracts

148
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,620
that we're seeing or inflationary impact to contracts that we're seeing today.

149
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,820
Next slide.

150
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,660
Okay, again, FY 22 accomplishments.

151
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,248
There have been several that have been going on prior to my arrival and

152
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:13,936
then since my arrival, they've continued to keep

153
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,488
the momentum going. I think the biggest takeaway throughout the

154
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:20,764
year has been the fact that the city has gotten aggressive and they recognize

155
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:24,452
the fact that we've had a shortage in some of our key

156
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:29,076
or critical positions, that being the driving positions. And the

157
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:32,550
$3,000 sign in bonus was great for a while,

158
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,904
but now we're recognizing the fact that everybody else

159
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:40,724
has gotten hip to the game. So we've got to continuously

160
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,864
think of something new and innovative to recruit and attract more

161
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:47,528
talent. So Mayor Turner actually, and as well as some of the council

162
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:51,000
members here, have been instrumental in kind of helping us develop CDL

163
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,780
training programs that we're currently working on right now. And then

164
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,048
we're also actively, still actively recruiting licensed

165
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:02,176
CDL drivers, but we've also got a pay increase on

166
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:05,936
the way for them as well. So hopefully that will continue to attract more

167
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,920
qualified talent in this area. Next slide.

168
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,924
Some of the FY 23 goals. Again I think the biggest goal that we have

169
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:20,416
that you'll hear me constantly say is we want to reduce

170
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:23,844
our dependency on the general fund. Meaning that we want to become

171
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:28,052
a more sustainable department in the way that we, we manage our department,

172
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:31,428
the way that we manage our resources and again become more solvent

173
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:34,916
in that process. We want to diversify the revenue streams

174
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:38,676
I know there's a lot of talk about the city of Houston not having

175
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:41,884
a residential rate and then that is the case too.

176
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:45,676
We would love to continue working on that and there's some other opportunities as

177
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:49,036
well to diversify the revenue streams as

178
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:52,672
well as it involves working

179
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:55,920
in the commercial sector or offering our services to some of the

180
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,010
commercial programs that may be out there throughout the city.

181
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,172
We also plan to reduce our vacancy rate. We're currently hovering around

182
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:06,964
17% right now, department wide, maybe about 15%

183
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:10,976
for our critical vacancies. Again, working with Mayor Turner,

184
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:14,708
adjusting the starting salary that should be taking place within the

185
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:18,216
next couple of days. We noticed that we think we'll be a little

186
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,684
bit more competitive with our counterparts in the private industry

187
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:25,450
and get our starting rate up closer to $22, $23 an hour.

188
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,672
And then we really want to work on standardizing our routes too.

189
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:32,444
And a lot of this has to do with the growth. And that's a good

190
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:36,392
thing. The growth that the city of Houston has incurred over the last decade.

191
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:40,064
And it's time for the solid waste department to catch up with that growth right

192
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:44,028
now so that we can continue our quest and accomplish our goals

193
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:48,240
as far as delivering on time services concerned. Next slide.

194
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,836
It's just a little graph and some studies that we've been doing again with the

195
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,228
long cities or the department's long range plan that's been out there.

196
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:01,652
Just a couple of facts over the last ten years. I believe

197
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:05,610
we see now the population of the city of Houston being about 6.6 million.

198
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,388
To us, that represents about 20,000 additional households

199
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:13,880
that we're still servicing with the same level of

200
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,890
organizational support that we had ten years ago.

201
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,052
And again about a 300 or 225 ton

202
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:24,776
increase on a daily basis that we're still responsible for collecting.

203
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:28,616
So we definitely feel the strain. Now the bottom, the other arrows may seem

204
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:32,160
a little bit confusing because we have it pointing down, but it says 2%

205
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,680
increase. The reason I did that is because again,

206
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,504
the city has grown exponentially in those ten years and the department has not

207
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:43,068
kept up with that growth and that's why we're experiencing

208
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:46,404
such challenges with service delays, probably a less than

209
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:50,128
a 1% increase and no increase in the size of the fleet.

210
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:54,244
You'll hear me constantly say we got to invest in our greatest assets,

211
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:57,304
employees and equipment. Without those two,

212
00:13:57,422 --> 00:14:01,416
we can't deliver that service. Next slide. I'm sorry, can you hold

213
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:04,696
that slide for a second? The top of the

214
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,700
chart, the line graph, just kind of illustrates that relationship

215
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,204
that you have. Most cities our

216
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:16,156
size has when it comes down to full time employees, to number of

217
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:19,276
households served. And you'll see the blue

218
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:22,240
line, which represents our FTEs,

219
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,672
normally should be above that orange line.

220
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:30,028
As far as households serve, you want to keep that relationship.

221
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:33,636
Houston is at the end. You see there's a big disparity there when

222
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:35,700
it comes down to our counterparts.

223
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,070
Next slide. And that

224
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,056
concludes our presentation. Happy to answer any questions that anyone may

225
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,716
have. Thank you, Director. First question comes from Council member Abby Cayman.

226
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:51,880
Thanks, Chair. First Director.

227
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,970
Thank you. And please relay our appreciation to

228
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,660
everyone in the department, especially our drivers that are out in the field.

229
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,436
Are they still working six days a week right now?

230
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:09,180
Yes, we're still at six days a week, hopefully not much longer.

231
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,136
Yeah, and I know I've seen some drivers out there. We all

232
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:16,064
work late, but not as late as they do. We're not up as early as

233
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:21,792
they are. So please relay my gratitude to them really

234
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:25,076
quickly. I wanted to check in because we talked about

235
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:28,836
the increase in multifamily and looking at

236
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:31,830
additional needs towards the future.

237
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,912
I had passed, with the support of council last fiscal year,

238
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:39,176
a budget amendment that was going to direct the department by

239
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,996
the end of fiscal year 22 to start the stakeholder

240
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:47,784
engagement process. So we can be looking at mandatory

241
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:51,356
multifamily recycling, whether the city takes on that burden or not,

242
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,956
just requires private, but where are

243
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:57,948
we in that process and has that begun yet? Yes,

244
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:01,568
and that's a good question. I'm happy to report that process is going,

245
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:05,184
it is ongoing. I believe the team started that

246
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:09,056
prior to my arrival and since then, now we are

247
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:12,324
to the point where we are meeting biweekly and when

248
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:16,340
I say we, I'm talking about members of the Apartment Association

249
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,212
and other industrial and

250
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:23,680
commercial businesses throughout town that represents those areas.

251
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,824
Perfect, because as we talk about future needs, and I know many of us around

252
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:30,356
the Horseshoe bring this up as to you, the life cycle

253
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:34,296
of our landfills and if we do not start curbing waste now,

254
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:37,964
we're going to be in big trouble. So I thank you for that

255
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:41,804
update. And in terms of the profitability of

256
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:45,804
recycling materials right now, are we seeing an improvement in that?

257
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:49,508
Yes, there's been a slight improvement in there. I think our CFO can attest

258
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:53,104
to that as well. In fact, I don't believe we

259
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:58,176
have to pay our processor now. Is that correct? Yeah. So the

260
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,032
way our contract is set up is that when the materials, the blended value

261
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:05,732
of the materials reaches a certain threshold that the city

262
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:09,408
doesn't have to pay. Right. And just one follow up on that and then I'll

263
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:12,996
go back in the queue. There was an

264
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:16,564
effort to educate on the contamination of recyclable

265
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:19,992
materials. Are we seeing an improvement in that?

266
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:23,544
Yes, we are. And we're currently working with our processor right now

267
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:26,852
to find out what that new rate is. When I arrived,

268
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:30,300
I believe our contamination rate was around 39%.

269
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,060
We're going to be doing another evaluation within

270
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,516
the next couple of weeks, in the next week or two, and we expect that

271
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:41,416
rate to be down. Terrific. We're already seeing indications fantastic.

272
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:45,504
And if I could go back in queue, please make sure council Member Amy Pick.

273
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:49,456
Thank you, Mayor Pertem. And thank you, Director. First, I want to thank you for

274
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:53,168
the work that you're doing, especially in District Day. We've seen a huge improvement

275
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:57,076
in collections since you've been on board. And when

276
00:17:57,098 --> 00:18:00,356
we were meeting about using our service funds to

277
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:03,668
supplement the work, your question was

278
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:07,064
you weren't just, of course we'll take your money. You were really

279
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:11,092
questioning, well, why are we not picking it up on time? And I really appreciated

280
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:15,124
how you were thinking about that. So my question is about

281
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:19,020
the business recycling program and the commercial collections.

282
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,340
Have those two programs been evaluated recently to see if it's

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,144
beneficial to continue that financially

284
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,056
or if that's something we should suspend or increase or has

285
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,400
that been evaluated? Yes, and we're currently

286
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,836
working with some partners here. When I say partners,

287
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:41,900
I mean these are big partners, ExxonMobil and whatnot. So we have

288
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,184
the small scale recycling,

289
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:48,736
commercial recycling program for the small producers and small businesses.

290
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:52,276
And that seems to be working relatively well right now. We know that there

291
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,784
are some opportunities for improvement, and we're working on addressing that

292
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:59,930
right now. But perhaps I think the biggest takeaway is that

293
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,184
a lot of the partners that want to work with us right now,

294
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:07,624
they see the value in that program. They appreciate the fact

295
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:10,924
that we've gotten started and they're ready to help us take it to the next

296
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:14,636
level. So abandoning it would not be the

297
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:18,332
right choice at this time. And as far as the commercial collections for

298
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:22,876
trash pickup, is that something that has been evaluated, too, where commercial

299
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:26,544
businesses can basically contract with the city for a pickup? That's something

300
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:30,248
that I'm evaluating right now. I still need to spend some time with our revenue

301
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:34,336
and finance team, but I do see some serious potentials

302
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:37,510
in there. Okay, thank you. We can't keep giving away the business.

303
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,420
Council Member Sally Alcorn.

304
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,600
Thank you, Chair, and thank you, director, for your presentation.

305
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,748
You're operating according to the solid waste, long range solid waste

306
00:19:51,764 --> 00:19:55,480
plan at a $20 to $40 million deficit.

307
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,916
Correct. Just walking in the door. $20 to $40 million

308
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:04,300
down, we're picking up 391,000

309
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,172
homes. Correct. We've got another 50,000 on

310
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:11,512
sponsorship that are paying their own private trash.

311
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:15,820
Correct. I really appreciated your slide that

312
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,052
had the different cities on there. I would add

313
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:22,244
that those cities that you

314
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:26,068
have on those slides, especially Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, all have a

315
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:29,620
fee. The fee in

316
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,968
Dallas is $34.30.

317
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:37,876
Weekly garbage and recycling, monthly brush and bulky bulk

318
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:41,544
waste. Austin has pay as you throw ranges from

319
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:44,792
twenty two dollars and sixty five cents to forty nine dollars and fifty

320
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:47,544
cents a month. San Antonio,

321
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:51,692
$14 through they also have pays. You throw through

322
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:55,624
$26. It's employees

323
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,552
and it's equipment. And I don't see how you get there

324
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:03,650
with $96 million a year from the general fund.

325
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,232
So I'd like you to give me

326
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:11,172
your experience in Tampa and any other experience you have with

327
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:15,636
how a fee was originated and

328
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:18,404
how you think that might play out here. Absolutely,

329
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:22,176
sure. In Tampa, as well as other enterprise

330
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,540
fund departments in the solid waste industry,

331
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,196
fee was a little bit higher in Tamps, around $36 per household.

332
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:33,448
But that fee was also covering the cost

333
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:36,856
of the service. So employees

334
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:40,936
and equipment first supplies the other associated

335
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,510
expenses that come along with managing a solid waste program.

336
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,552
People often forget about the true cost of disposal.

337
00:21:48,696 --> 00:21:51,984
Those are real dollars. So when we show up at a

338
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:56,236
disposal facility at a landfill and we have to drive across someone's

339
00:21:56,268 --> 00:22:00,512
scales, there's no sort of internal fund transfer that

340
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:04,896
satisfies that transaction. There's a check that they're looking for and that disposal

341
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:08,052
cost usually cost about a third of the service.

342
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:11,988
And if I was going to rank it, I would probably rank it somewhere between

343
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:15,464
number one and three. When it comes down to the

344
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,904
assets, it's going to be right there. Between the cost of employees and the cost

345
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:22,760
of equipment are the three greatest

346
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,628
costs of that service. So again, that's what your rate is designed

347
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:29,964
to cover. In Tampa, we also had a different

348
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:33,516
disposal system, so we had a bond to cover. So our rate was

349
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:37,164
designed to cover the cost of satisfying the bond each

350
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:40,648
year. However, once we reached the areas

351
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:44,204
and the bonds matured and we paid that bond off, we enjoyed a $14

352
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:47,392
million swing. Really, it's about a $28 million

353
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:51,200
swing. All of that money did not stay in the department.

354
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,440
We can't show a profit. We cover our reserves,

355
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,836
rainy day funds and whatnot. The rest of that has to go back to the

356
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:02,484
general fund in order to support other areas of the city.

357
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,908
So whenever you hear me talk about a rate or bringing on a

358
00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:09,336
rate, it's number one to take care of what we need to take care

359
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:12,776
of in house so that we can deliver the on time service and have the

360
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,424
equipment that we need so that our men and women can show up

361
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:20,184
and deliver that and not have to stay out until eight or 09:00

362
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,804
at night or come in on a Sunday. But it's to cover that

363
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:27,630
first and then support the other areas of the city that need it second.

364
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,164
And when you talk about the city of Houston, we got a lot of work

365
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,880
to do, right. So if we were to embark upon that road,

366
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,176
it's going to be a couple of years before we start seeing the benefits of

367
00:23:38,198 --> 00:23:42,096
that return. But the goal would be, again, as I mentioned earlier, to reduce

368
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:46,196
our dependency on the general fund and allow those funds to

369
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:49,510
be used for other areas throughout the city.

370
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,984
I told Council Member Pat I was offended when she sat across

371
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:57,236
from me and said that she wanted to run her solid waste

372
00:23:57,268 --> 00:23:59,050
programs like, well, what are we?

373
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,576
And I know Houston has gotten away with it, but I think with the

374
00:24:05,598 --> 00:24:08,668
times and conditions and the way things are today,

375
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:12,268
we've got to find some way to offset that, and I think our residents and

376
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:16,184
customers deserve better. Council Member

377
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:19,644
Carolyn Evan Shabbaz. Thank you, Mayor Protem. And thank you,

378
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:23,248
director. I don't know if you ever settled. I know we talked about

379
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,810
living in district d, but at any rate,

380
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,280
I'm just curious. We talked before about hot teams and

381
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,976
how only some districts have to employ

382
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:38,496
people for hot teams. In my particular district,

383
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:42,704
we employ four people and pay for two trucks.

384
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:47,092
And I think we talked about how that cost could possibly be absorbed

385
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:51,172
because it does take out of our districts,

386
00:24:51,236 --> 00:24:54,404
whereas there are others that don't have to pay those costs.

387
00:24:54,532 --> 00:24:57,840
So I didn't see anything in the budget regarding

388
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,070
that, and so I'm encouraged that there's still an opportunity.

389
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,196
So maybe you can address that in terms of making that

390
00:25:05,218 --> 00:25:08,380
a little bit more equitable. Thank you. And to make sure I understand

391
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,728
your question, are you talking about being able to cover the cost of

392
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:15,264
what the hot teams are providing or expenses associated with

393
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:18,876
all districts? I don't think all the districts

394
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:22,756
have them. There are those that do, but there are all districts. Do you

395
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:25,590
have one? A hot team? No. Okay.

396
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,652
No. We're talking about solid waste right now.

397
00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:33,164
So I'm not trying to compare what each person pays,

398
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:36,856
but my question is we have to hire four. I have in my case,

399
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:40,248
we are four men or women,

400
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,620
and we pay for two trucks for trash

401
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,776
pickup. And I'm just wondering because you and

402
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,156
I had the conversation not trying to say that others don't pay for other

403
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:54,024
things, that I may pay for something that you may not, but somewhat

404
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:58,450
it just doesn't somewhat seem equitable for

405
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,784
some districts to have to pay for hot teams and employ

406
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:07,036
additional people to pick up that which all Houstonians

407
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:10,016
expect. Right. And so if you could address that,

408
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:13,540
I'd appreciate it. Absolutely. And I think what we may be seeing

409
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:18,916
is it may speak to trying

410
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:22,900
to find the right way to say this, the difference in neighborhoods

411
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,216
throughout the city of Houston, as large as it is.

412
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:30,564
You have some neighborhoods where we see development

413
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:34,104
occurring, and as that development is occurring, we notice the amount

414
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:38,044
of illegal dumping and the needs for hot teams will

415
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:42,430
kind of draw down. In other districts. They may have

416
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,604
a few more commercial areas than residential areas, so their

417
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:50,560
approach may be a little bit different. It may be a quarterly approach or

418
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,624
something of that nature. But what we're seeing and what I'm observing is

419
00:26:54,662 --> 00:26:59,212
that each district has its own unique features,

420
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:03,036
and one district may require a hot team. And we appreciate

421
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:06,196
the hot teams because they kind of fill in the

422
00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:09,636
gap right now where we want to, but we just can't because we're trying

423
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:13,716
to address the more pressing issues. And I think that's why you

424
00:27:13,738 --> 00:27:16,808
may see that from as I travel throughout and I look at some of the

425
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:20,664
neighborhoods and I see where there is a greater need for

426
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:24,504
some of those areas. And I think the wonderful thing that I've learned about City

427
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,588
of Houston, I was kind of kicking myself because I wish I would have met

428
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:31,452
with them on the first day that I was here is the Mayor's Office of

429
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:35,272
Innovation and Sustainability. They've got some wonderful

430
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:39,084
ideas. And we were chatting the other day about now

431
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:42,816
that we know where a majority of our debris is being generated at

432
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:46,672
what kind of programs, how can we augment our programs so that we can

433
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:49,984
concentrate our equipment in those areas and not as

434
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:53,196
heavy on the areas where there is not as much generation

435
00:27:53,228 --> 00:27:56,676
of the illegal dumping and whatnot? And I think that's why a lot of

436
00:27:56,698 --> 00:28:00,148
times you'll see that difference. Right. I do understand that it's a difference,

437
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:03,604
but we had talked about it, and I didn't know if you were able to

438
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:06,776
do that, which we talked about, but apparently not at this

439
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,116
juncture, not at this time. But we're still working on it. We haven't forgot

440
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:15,060
about that request. Thank you. And in fact, I'm going to address

441
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,310
something in your district pretty soon.

442
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,500
Vice chair, Ed Pollard.

443
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,220
Chatty Cathy over there. Thank you, Chair, and thank you,

444
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,984
Director, for your presentation. A couple

445
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:32,832
of things. One,

446
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:36,448
if we were to have a fee, what would be

447
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:39,740
some of the priority areas of your department

448
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,756
that would see an impact from that fee from

449
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:48,756
the jump? Would it be additional drivers? Would it be pay for

450
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:52,260
additional equipment? Like, where would that money go towards? Right.

451
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,848
So when you say from the jump for us, from the jump means

452
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:59,592
at least a year out with the time

453
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:03,656
that's required to secure equipment and the

454
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:07,384
shortages and the backlogs and what it takes to

455
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:11,084
secure that equipment, you're talking about a good year,

456
00:29:11,122 --> 00:29:14,364
a year and a half out. So what you would see

457
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:17,784
right off the bat is on time service. So you put your recycling

458
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:21,768
container out on Monday, and that's your schedule collection day. It's collected by

459
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:25,616
Monday at 05:00. Okay, thank you. And also, I just want to give

460
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:29,436
you a shout out for being real open minded about the District J Private

461
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,832
Trash Day and working with our office to collaborate on ways

462
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:36,176
in which to make that program efficient. It's something that we're

463
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:40,000
continuing and that the constituents seem to find beneficial.

464
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,510
So thank you again. Look forward to continuing working with you.

465
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,440
Thank you, Director. Wilfred, I must say, you've done

466
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,888
a bang up job in your initial time here. I used to always tell everybody,

467
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:54,244
I love me some Harry Hayes. I'll always love me some Harry Hayes.

468
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,896
But you've done a great job coming in and picking up what Harry Hayes

469
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:01,944
started developing. I hate to see Mr. Anthony Bowie

470
00:30:01,992 --> 00:30:04,670
retiring. And I see Ms. Carolyn out there.

471
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,972
They did a great job for us many, many times,

472
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:12,272
and especially in 2017, when I had the

473
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:15,616
blessing and the honor of working with, I think, one of

474
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:19,292
your counterparts. He actually did a stint in Temp in Tampa.

475
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:23,116
Mr. Mccreck, Kerry, and David ran solid waste

476
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:26,612
in San Antonio at the time. And Jessica and I spent literally 40

477
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:30,436
days in a row with them, never missing a day. And he and I

478
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,268
would talk about various things. And one of the things that struck me is he

479
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:36,408
was telling me that you all had a waste energy

480
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:40,104
plant in Tampa and you would sell the waste to the

481
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:43,400
energy electric company and they would move the

482
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,316
waste into electricity. Is there any option for

483
00:30:47,358 --> 00:30:51,176
us here in the city to do something similar to what you did in Tampa?

484
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:54,300
I would love it. It is an expensive undertaker,

485
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,448
I tell you, but it is definitely

486
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:02,076
a way to save space, and it eliminates

487
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:05,248
the need for the landfills. That's the biggest value right there.

488
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:08,690
So, idea wise, how much does it cost?

489
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,088
Today, you're probably looking at about a billion dollars. Yeah.

490
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:16,964
The last one that I know of that was permitted in South Florida was about

491
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:20,356
880,000,000. And that was about three or four years ago.

492
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,860
Okay. And another quick question. Years ago,

493
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,700
we made a lot of money on commodities.

494
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,690
The commodity market was a lot different. How is it today? I know that

495
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,816
I'm literally thinking maybe six, seven years ago, we were making a good deal

496
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:39,356
of money on commodities and then went south on us, and then we started paying

497
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:42,812
waste management to take our commodities. Is there

498
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:45,996
any coming back in that market I haven't really looked at? Yeah, it's kind of

499
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:49,448
leveled out, but we're still not seeing what you all enjoyed

500
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:52,736
during that time ago. In fact, from Florida, I used to

501
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:56,208
look at that and I used to catch heat because people would say,

502
00:31:56,214 --> 00:32:00,428
how come you're not doing what Texas is doing? But again, it's a

503
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:04,240
regional market. It's very volatile.

504
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,116
I definitely wouldn't bet my life savings on

505
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:11,636
it. But right now, we're kind of breaking even in

506
00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:15,684
that recycling market as far as the commodities are concerned. Thank you,

507
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:19,016
Director Bowie. We'll miss you. You've done a

508
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,908
great job for us, for you. And so have you, director Wright. Even though you're

509
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:25,160
not going anywhere, we're not letting you. Council member Robert Gallegos.

510
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,032
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. Thank you, Director, for the presentation.

511
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:32,780
It was enjoyed visiting with you last week

512
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,396
in regards to getting some updates, I know

513
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:38,910
that leaving my office right now.

514
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,584
Constituent services pointed out to me that we have a constituent that has

515
00:32:43,622 --> 00:32:47,184
been waiting for a trash can, because I believe their trash can was

516
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:50,728
stolen, and they've been waiting for a. Trash can since April.

517
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:54,916
I know that we have some trash cans that

518
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:59,316
are sitting on Capitol Street that they're still been waiting for

519
00:32:59,338 --> 00:33:02,724
that trash to be picked up. And I say all this

520
00:33:02,762 --> 00:33:06,072
because I want you to elaborate what's happening

521
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:09,556
in regards to trucks breaking down, the lack of hiring

522
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:13,064
employees. That way the general public can hear exactly

523
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:17,464
what the issues are because all

524
00:33:17,502 --> 00:33:21,192
they see is that they want their can and the can is not being delivered.

525
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:24,236
Right. All they're seeing is that they want their trash can picked up and their

526
00:33:24,258 --> 00:33:27,708
trash hasn't been delivered until they call our office and we try to

527
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:31,244
explain to them what the situation is. If we're leaning

528
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:34,960
towards a fee, we need to let the public

529
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,576
know why. So if you can elaborate what the

530
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:42,544
issues are, please. Yeah, and there's several compounding

531
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:46,550
issues and I think we also want to be clear to say that

532
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,792
the fee gets us going in the right direction. It's not the magic elixir.

533
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:55,416
So what people may be experiencing when they

534
00:33:55,438 --> 00:33:58,596
run into those delays is, again, we're dealing

535
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:02,200
with 420 some odd employees department wide.

536
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,020
That's not enough. 645 sq mi.

537
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,436
645 sq mi. Exactly. So what

538
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:13,484
you see the team doing is concentrating on the big

539
00:34:13,522 --> 00:34:16,940
fires and trying to keep those from growing even larger.

540
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,864
So if somebody's waiting on a can, it could very well be because

541
00:34:20,982 --> 00:34:24,976
another team member was reassigned to take care of a route and

542
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:28,224
that may have been more pressing that day. We have

543
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:31,584
some systems that we also have to kind of update and how

544
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:35,924
we as it pertains to logistics and maybe

545
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:40,064
service order management to kind of make that a little bit more electronic

546
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:44,036
than manual. So that's part of the growth and development opportunities that

547
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:47,130
we have in the department that we haven't been able to take advantage of.

548
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,816
And again, you mentioned earlier about the vehicles. Some of the

549
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,770
vehicles in our fleet are as old as

550
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,856
minimum ten years old. And the average life of a garbage truck

551
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:08,540
should be around five to seven years. You should be replacing them.

552
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,248
So we've got to get that vehicle replacement program up

553
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:15,952
to where it should be so that once we know that five to seven

554
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:19,664
year mark is there, we're looking at trying to replace that. Because believe

555
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:23,232
it or not, you're spending more money on maintaining that vehicle

556
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:27,344
than the vehicle is now worth. So when those vehicles

557
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:31,444
break down, if the manufacturers and you've got your

558
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:34,548
three models or four models in now, you've got to wait on a part to

559
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:37,716
be fabricated in order to get that vehicle fixed,

560
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:41,720
which means it has to sit and wait for a couple of weeks longer.

561
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:46,036
And all of that when you don't have, again, two greatest assets the absence

562
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:49,228
of employees, the absence of equipment. You're going to experience

563
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:53,244
those delays in services. So the

564
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:56,428
model that the team has generated that seems to be effective right now.

565
00:35:56,514 --> 00:35:59,820
They're always going to concentrate on garbage first.

566
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,164
We don't want that to sit out for days and whatnot

567
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:07,324
and draw the flies and vectors that come along with that. And then we'll

568
00:36:07,372 --> 00:36:12,064
make up the recycling a little bit later during the week. So just

569
00:36:12,102 --> 00:36:15,872
a snapshot of the delay. And what I've stated to your predecessor,

570
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:19,396
Director Hayes, when he brought this to my attention years ago, that we were

571
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:22,816
needing a garbage fee because all these other major cities in the state of Texas

572
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:26,696
have a monthly garbage fee. What I

573
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:30,056
stated as when I was president of my civic club and president of the super

574
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:34,196
neighborhood. And I've asked and mentioned this to civic

575
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:38,236
clubs when I go out and they start talking about missed pickups and

576
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:42,600
what have you regarding trash is that if there is a garbage fee,

577
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,076
in my opinion, I'm hoping it's not just to pick

578
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:49,672
up your trash can and your recycling

579
00:36:49,736 --> 00:36:53,936
bid. It's also going to be to pick up those tires that

580
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:57,596
are being dumped on the vacant lot. It's also to be pick up that illegal

581
00:36:57,628 --> 00:37:01,672
dumping, that's being dumped in the neighborhood, that's bringing down our neighborhood,

582
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:05,648
that's causing crime because of all this illegal dumping.

583
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:10,228
So it's a catch 22 and we pay a

584
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:13,764
monthly garbage fee. Constituents are going to expect more than just

585
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:17,488
picking up the trash can and your recycling bin. And that's

586
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:20,676
what I'm hoping will happen is that we'll be able to pick up those tires

587
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:24,008
while I'm able to pick up the illegal dumping and clean up our neighborhoods at

588
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:27,676
the same time. And I think the majority of the public will

589
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:31,676
go with it. Exactly. Just to add

590
00:37:31,698 --> 00:37:35,404
on to that, again, there are some opportunities to create some more

591
00:37:35,442 --> 00:37:39,544
programs that concentrate on solid waste. And I know we have code enforcement

592
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:43,104
officers and we work with our neighborhood department with that.

593
00:37:43,142 --> 00:37:46,464
But in order to address the issues that we have

594
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:50,044
now, I really feel that there would be some benefits for the solid waste department

595
00:37:50,092 --> 00:37:53,524
to have its own code enforcement team, maybe two or three

596
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:57,488
for each sector. And as we see these illegal

597
00:37:57,504 --> 00:38:01,056
dumping issues pop up, it gives us an opportunity to concentrate

598
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:04,564
the time that's needed on mitigating the issues. And I know you brought that

599
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:08,456
up to me when we met. And I totally agree that there needs to

600
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:12,312
be code enforcement inspectors inside of waste so that those

601
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:15,384
that end up putting their illegal dumping out a day

602
00:38:15,422 --> 00:38:19,340
or two after it was already picked up in the neighborhood, they can be told

603
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:23,036
you're not supposed to do this. Give them a warning and hopefully they

604
00:38:23,058 --> 00:38:26,300
will stop doing that in that way of cleaning up our neighborhoods.

605
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,084
Council Member David Robinson. Thank you, chair Director,

606
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:34,464
thanks very much for all the reasons colleagues have said. I wanted

607
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:38,192
to pick up not only on points made

608
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:41,476
about the requisite collaboration that

609
00:38:41,498 --> 00:38:45,236
you have to do with other departments, whether that's the dawn in

610
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:49,012
the case of potential generation of

611
00:38:49,146 --> 00:38:52,564
electricity that the Chair asked you about, we know

612
00:38:52,602 --> 00:38:56,264
that's real. We witnessed it ourselves. Mayor Pro

613
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:59,544
TEM on our recent trip to Denmark, which is

614
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:03,448
where we were escorted with the delegation, was really about

615
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:07,404
the Public Works Department. And that's where the

616
00:39:07,442 --> 00:39:10,828
importance of your collaboration, Director, with those

617
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:14,252
who have maybe more infrastructure dollars in their

618
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:18,076
departments already. Or ways in which we can bridge

619
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:21,628
the gap between our solid waste management concerns

620
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:25,308
and how we might actually embrace

621
00:39:25,484 --> 00:39:29,612
how your part of our annual budget becomes

622
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:33,664
part of our generation of electricity and our utility

623
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:37,844
structure and part of what we're doing with the overall maintenance and

624
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:40,864
management of our resources.

625
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:44,724
And I know that's not news to you with your experience in Tampa.

626
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:48,244
It's something I mean, you did throw out the billion

627
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:51,556
dollar figure for a plant.

628
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:55,584
And I'd like to observe that that is a really fungible

629
00:39:55,652 --> 00:39:58,910
number that's not set at one point.

630
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,016
Repeating billion, that's scalable in a lot of different directions.

631
00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:06,968
How you do it, what you do with the money, is entirely

632
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:11,328
subject to how we might devise or design a program.

633
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:15,084
And so in your six months here, I know you've already brought

634
00:40:15,132 --> 00:40:18,876
a lot of innovation to the department. And I'm so pleased

635
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:22,256
to see it and witness the work you're doing. I want

636
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:25,584
to encourage you to continue to work with the Office of Innovation

637
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:29,350
in the Mayor's department as well as the Sustainable Office.

638
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,668
And that's really my comment. If you have anything to add to that,

639
00:40:33,754 --> 00:40:37,768
I'd love to hear it. Thank you. Council Member Robinson I

640
00:40:37,774 --> 00:40:40,488
don't want that billion dollars to scare you, right? It's a big number.

641
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:44,376
But you got to look at the value of that beyond the

642
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:47,992
dollars and cents. So that's land

643
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:51,676
that you're not taking up that could probably be used for

644
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:55,772
housing or some sort of future development or just

645
00:40:55,826 --> 00:40:59,612
preservation or whatever the case may be. And then the amount

646
00:40:59,746 --> 00:41:03,136
of revenue that you generate from the sale of energy, which you have

647
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:07,228
to be careful of nowadays because you have other forms

648
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:10,800
of energy that are now competitive on the market, CNG and

649
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,124
whatnot you have to watch that, but it does

650
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:17,364
go towards offsetting that expense. And just

651
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:20,688
to give you a quick story of my level of ignorance, when I was appointed

652
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:23,796
to be Director in Tampa, the first thing I wanted to do was sell the

653
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:27,752
waste energy plant because it cost us 10 million

654
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:31,000
to run and we only got 5 million in return.

655
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,520
I'm like, this doesn't make sense. But then I thought about it.

656
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,692
Where are we going to go? Our trucks are going to have to drive 60

657
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:41,804
miles now just to go to one landfill. So the value of

658
00:41:41,842 --> 00:41:46,284
having that waste energy plant there was

659
00:41:46,322 --> 00:41:49,936
more than just the dollars and cents. Appreciate that very much.

660
00:41:50,118 --> 00:41:53,884
Council Member Abby Cayman Director

661
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:57,616
normally I ask a question, the question everyone's heard

662
00:41:57,638 --> 00:42:01,324
it already about the needs of the department looking forward, but I think you've covered

663
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,836
a lot of those in terms of looking ahead at the future and

664
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:08,404
what we need. Is there anything you want to add to that

665
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:12,070
that has not been discussed? I'm glad you asked.

666
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,730
No, but we did. We covered a lot of it.

667
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,576
As far as any sort of unmet needs as it

668
00:42:21,598 --> 00:42:25,264
relates to that. You heard me talk about vehicle

669
00:42:25,332 --> 00:42:29,324
coordination. That really involves having someone in our department that

670
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:32,812
just focuses on nothing but vehicles. And they

671
00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:35,864
maintain this outstanding relationship with fleet maintenance.

672
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:39,956
They hold us accountable, make sure that we're taking care of the equipment

673
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:43,296
and then they also work with fleet maintenance to make sure vehicles are available.

674
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:47,136
You heard me speak often about code enforcement officers as well,

675
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,268
a necessary part, additional drivers.

676
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:54,516
Right now, probably one of the most startling things that I've seen is I go

677
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,968
out on route run into, believe it's

678
00:42:57,984 --> 00:43:01,696
Daniel Williams at the Southeast Service Center. And he's

679
00:43:01,728 --> 00:43:04,288
picking up and I asked him how many homes does he have on his route

680
00:43:04,304 --> 00:43:07,656
and he tells me 3000. I said he's exaggerating. I get back

681
00:43:07,678 --> 00:43:11,256
to the service center to know he's telling the truth. And that's an

682
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:14,680
example of the department continuously trying

683
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,008
its quest to want to serve our public and

684
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:21,148
provide that service and giving us everything we got.

685
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:25,128
But I can tell you 3000 homes for one driver is unrealistic.

686
00:43:25,224 --> 00:43:28,364
The truck will be throwing in the towel at that point in time. They said

687
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:31,744
they can't do it. We end up overworking the driver in the truck and we

688
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:33,170
end up in a bad situation.

689
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,576
Again, I definitely want to continue to focus on the illegal dumping this here.

690
00:43:38,678 --> 00:43:42,352
I want to see if we can start dropping some more cameras throughout the city

691
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:46,144
in some of those areas that have a lot of that unnecessary activity,

692
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:49,844
see if we can curb some of that behavior. Public Works has been

693
00:43:49,882 --> 00:43:53,616
great to work with as well. We're going to find some of the roads

694
00:43:53,648 --> 00:43:56,650
that are less traveled, like what we had on the news the other day,

695
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,456
and see if we can just block some of the ingress and egress off to

696
00:44:00,478 --> 00:44:03,864
curb that behavior. Well, again, I appreciate it and like

697
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:07,084
you said, one team or

698
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:09,980
one person having to deal with 3000 homes,

699
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,116
we shouldn't be asking any city employee to deal with

700
00:44:15,138 --> 00:44:18,500
that. So, thanks. My gratitude again. And also I know you've

701
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,016
really put your head to the ground trying to figure out

702
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:25,616
some new and unique ways of recruiting and job training.

703
00:44:25,718 --> 00:44:29,692
So I just appreciate the leadership

704
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:33,584
you and your team are providing. Thank you. Council Member

705
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:37,204
Sally Alcorn. Thank you, Chair. What are our

706
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:41,270
annual tipping fees? I believe we hover around

707
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,730
25 $26 per ton.

708
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,788
And on the recycling revenue?

709
00:44:50,964 --> 00:44:55,584
The recycling fund performance measures, it has 12% curbside

710
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:58,910
recycling. What exactly does that mean? What is that figure?

711
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,784
It's on the performance measures in the budget book. It says curbside

712
00:45:03,832 --> 00:45:07,020
recycling rate, single stream, 12% target.

713
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,436
I'm not familiar. I have to look that up. You're saying it's in the budget

714
00:45:11,468 --> 00:45:12,050
book?

715
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,760
Roman numeral ten, 164. Okay.

716
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,548
There's some targets. It's the same target as last year. I just don't know what

717
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:23,556
that means. What's that? 12%. Okay, thank you.

718
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:26,804
And you mentioned 15% critical vacancies in

719
00:45:26,842 --> 00:45:30,416
numbers. I'm curious on how many drivers you're

720
00:45:30,448 --> 00:45:33,380
down. About 55 right now. 55?

721
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,730
55 drivers. Okay.

722
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,388
What other critical positions are vacant?

723
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:42,936
Those are going to be the critical. Those are critical. Okay, so when you talk

724
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:46,776
critical vacancies, you're talking about drivers. Yeah, we're talking about drivers.

725
00:45:46,968 --> 00:45:50,140
And you're in the works of bringing those

726
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,608
entry level salaries up? Absolutely. Mayor Turner

727
00:45:53,624 --> 00:45:58,136
and I have been working together and he's

728
00:45:58,168 --> 00:46:01,456
authorized a 6% increase. And now when we

729
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:04,636
go out, we're also increasing the number of job fairs

730
00:46:04,668 --> 00:46:07,776
that we're attending working with our HR department, jane Cheeks and her team.

731
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:11,344
Okay, great. And thank you

732
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:15,044
for your help on composting. I noticed it on your accomplishments, the composting drop off.

733
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:18,916
And thank you for working with the Office of Innovation and my team on what

734
00:46:18,938 --> 00:46:22,656
might come next. I agree with Council Member Gallegos. I think that the fee

735
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:25,412
is going to have to come with some extras. And I think if we do

736
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:28,728
go to curbside recycling like other cities, it would be a

737
00:46:28,734 --> 00:46:32,436
voluntary program and an additional fee on the people who want to participate.

738
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:36,164
And you'd be surprised how many want to participate. Denver has started

739
00:46:36,222 --> 00:46:39,996
this and there's thousands and thousands. But I

740
00:46:40,018 --> 00:46:43,180
can't put anything more on the solid waste department.

741
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,356
We're trying to get less trash so we can save more of

742
00:46:47,378 --> 00:46:51,056
that $25 per ton in shipping fees. Absolutely. Thank you.

743
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:54,464
Council member Tasha Jackson. Thank you. And thank you,

744
00:46:54,502 --> 00:46:57,744
director, and your team. I just wanted to commend you guys on a great job

745
00:46:57,782 --> 00:47:00,672
that you're doing. Just working with you,

746
00:47:00,726 --> 00:47:04,224
our hot team. Of course I have the hot team. And you had a conversation

747
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:08,196
about that. I was hoping we can pull them out, but we

748
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:11,988
can't. So we can use our dollars somewhere else. But you

749
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:15,616
can see the difference. You can see the neighborhood is a little

750
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:19,256
bit cleaned, a little bit better, but we

751
00:47:19,278 --> 00:47:22,488
need more work and I know we need more money. And so I just want

752
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:26,200
you to know I support the fee if you guys

753
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:29,688
approach that. Approach that because I know we need dollars to move the follow waste

754
00:47:29,704 --> 00:47:33,308
department together forward. But I just want to say congratulations and thank you for

755
00:47:33,314 --> 00:47:36,732
everything that you're doing. Thank you. If I can just add to that,

756
00:47:36,866 --> 00:47:39,790
and I've heard Mayor Turner mention it as well,

757
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,292
another part of success, even though it doesn't involve this, is the funding,

758
00:47:45,436 --> 00:47:49,184
ARPA funding and some of the grant funding that we're able to take advantage of.

759
00:47:49,302 --> 00:47:53,004
I would really like to position the department so that when that funding

760
00:47:53,052 --> 00:47:56,836
goes away, we can continue to maintain some of these programs that

761
00:47:56,858 --> 00:47:59,972
we're able to embark upon right now. And I did ask my question,

762
00:48:00,026 --> 00:48:03,684
the anti litter campaign. So would that continue? Because that's been a big

763
00:48:03,722 --> 00:48:07,728
help. Yes, we are actually in the process of evaluating bids on

764
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:11,080
that right now. Okay. So that will continue, and you should not experience

765
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:14,516
a gap in that. That's been the help. So thank you so much for keeping

766
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:17,752
that council member, Robert Gallegos. Thank you

767
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:21,256
for Tim. And again, thank you, Director, for everything. You're doing an outstanding

768
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:25,180
job. I know you're new here and you're getting all these headaches,

769
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,244
but you're doing a great job. So thank you. I just

770
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:33,248
also want to mention that if we do go with the possibly in

771
00:48:33,254 --> 00:48:36,752
the near future, in the future, a fee that

772
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:40,896
also, hopefully we follow. I understand Director Hayes had mentioned the

773
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,436
San Antonio model where they have a large trash can. They have

774
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:48,240
a small trash can, and it depends on the homeowner.

775
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,052
If they have quite a bit of trash, then they'll be paying for a large

776
00:48:52,106 --> 00:48:56,068
trash can, whatever that monthly fee is.

777
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:59,672
If they have a small trash can, then they'll be paying a little less than

778
00:48:59,726 --> 00:49:03,096
what that normal fee is. So hopefully that's another

779
00:49:03,198 --> 00:49:06,904
model that we can follow also, and that

780
00:49:06,942 --> 00:49:10,412
also encourages people to put more recycling stuff into

781
00:49:10,466 --> 00:49:14,092
your recycling bin, so that way you'll have a smaller trash can and pay

782
00:49:14,146 --> 00:49:17,836
less on your fee. So I'm hoping that's something that

783
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:21,312
we can look at as well. I'm with you

784
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:24,816
100%. I can't even speak. You're talking just as much trash as

785
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:28,576
I am right now. So there are

786
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:32,064
no other council members in queue. I'll ask my last question a

787
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,916
couple of years ago. This is probably six years ago.

788
00:49:35,018 --> 00:49:38,292
As you well know, many areas of the city have

789
00:49:38,346 --> 00:49:42,020
private trash collection, and we pay them $6 a month

790
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:46,104
per household for them

791
00:49:46,142 --> 00:49:49,972
to get their private collection. We looked at eliminating

792
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:53,592
that, and we discovered that eliminating that would cost

793
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:57,476
us a ton of money more, mainly because we don't have the workforce

794
00:49:57,508 --> 00:50:00,988
and we don't have the trucks. So we kept that intact. So when

795
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:04,236
you talk about garbage fee, I know it would have to

796
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:08,028
be across the board, so everyone in the city of Houston would have

797
00:50:08,034 --> 00:50:13,296
to be a part of it. So let's say if you have 500,000

798
00:50:13,398 --> 00:50:17,056
households and it was $72 a

799
00:50:17,078 --> 00:50:20,032
year, $6 a month times twelve months,

800
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:24,164
that would equate to probably around $34 million that we could

801
00:50:24,202 --> 00:50:27,396
use on something like that. But my question to you, I'm not sure what you

802
00:50:27,418 --> 00:50:30,790
had in Tampa or your other experience.

803
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,960
How difficult is it to get folks that are on private collection

804
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,456
where we really in order for us to pick it up,

805
00:50:38,478 --> 00:50:42,440
it would cost us probably three or four times the $6 a month.

806
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:45,784
Right. How do we put the genie back in the bottle? In that

807
00:50:45,822 --> 00:50:49,484
case, I think we offer a rate that is just as

808
00:50:49,522 --> 00:50:53,452
competitive as the private company that is providing that current

809
00:50:53,506 --> 00:50:57,084
level of service. I think although we pay $6

810
00:50:57,122 --> 00:51:00,256
a month, I believe that those residents are actually paying a little bit more to

811
00:51:00,278 --> 00:51:03,984
the company. We just

812
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:08,284
have to make sure that we cover our cost of service. And normally with municipalities,

813
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:12,128
that rate is a little bit lower than our private counterparts.

814
00:51:12,304 --> 00:51:15,520
They are there to turn a profit. We're there for reliability.

815
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,364
So if we cover our cost of service, we should be just

816
00:51:19,402 --> 00:51:21,590
as competitive. However,

817
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,216
we're to the position right now, like you mentioned earlier, we can't take on any

818
00:51:26,238 --> 00:51:29,944
additional service right now. So the key to doing that is

819
00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:33,016
to crawl before we walk. Yeah.

820
00:51:33,118 --> 00:51:36,452
Great. Thank you. And before I leave, another great employee,

821
00:51:36,516 --> 00:51:39,416
fairly new Veronica, doing a great job for us. So thank you.

822
00:51:39,438 --> 00:51:42,904
I'll pass that along. Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you, chair.

823
00:51:42,952 --> 00:51:46,216
And just to jump in, I just want to be clear. If you have private

824
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:49,288
trash right now, you're already paying a fee for your private trash.

825
00:51:49,384 --> 00:51:52,748
You would not be paying the city's trash fee.

826
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:56,304
It would be like clear, like water authority, people not paying

827
00:51:56,342 --> 00:52:00,256
the drainage. Calm down. I didn't say that. I know exactly what we

828
00:52:00,278 --> 00:52:03,540
pay. We get $6 a month,

829
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:07,524
$72 a year. And we pay waste management or a

830
00:52:07,562 --> 00:52:10,804
trash collection in addition to it. So my

831
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:14,544
question is if we talk about a garbage fee and it goes citywide,

832
00:52:14,592 --> 00:52:17,336
there is no way on God's green earth these guys will be able to pick

833
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:20,792
it up right away. No way. Yeah. So you'd keep your private trust. Yeah.

834
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:24,264
And all you hear me talk about building it up. Right. Building those

835
00:52:24,302 --> 00:52:27,924
reserves. The first priority should be reducing

836
00:52:27,972 --> 00:52:31,356
our dependency on the general fund. That means we're able to stand on

837
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:34,764
our own. Once we do that, we don't take on

838
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:38,156
any additional service until we can cover the costs. That means that we

839
00:52:38,178 --> 00:52:41,468
have the employees and equipment to provide that service. Exactly. So you have to have

840
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:44,944
a build up, take you a year to buy equipment and employees. And from

841
00:52:44,982 --> 00:52:48,176
what we're experiencing right now, we can't get drivers. Right. So how are you going

842
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,648
to get drivers to do citywide? Mayor Turner. And I got a

843
00:52:51,654 --> 00:52:54,180
plan. We're going to turn that around. You got a plan? I like that.

844
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:58,516
Well, thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks for your time. Thank you. We have a

845
00:52:58,538 --> 00:53:01,924
1234 public speakers. We'll start it out

846
00:53:01,962 --> 00:53:03,640
with Mr. Jason Oliver.

847
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,600
Star six to unmute.

848
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:14,314
First, I'm concerned about driver safety.

849
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:17,806
I know that solid waste has been doing a lot with

850
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:21,698
very little and it seems like even less this year in

851
00:53:21,704 --> 00:53:25,186
the budget we're looking at. Council member Cayman talked about early days and

852
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:28,866
late nights with people working six days a week. I recall reading an article about

853
00:53:28,888 --> 00:53:32,766
a driver fainting and we're approaching the summer, how are we taking

854
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:36,198
care of driver safety and are we making improvements there?

855
00:53:36,364 --> 00:53:40,294
And then a second question to follow up on something Council Member Pollard said,

856
00:53:40,412 --> 00:53:43,590
because I want to make sure I know who to direct my comments to.

857
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,322
Directors report. He said Directors report to the mayor and they were directed to leave.

858
00:53:47,376 --> 00:53:51,194
It sounds like you're telling us that it's not city council, but the mayor who

859
00:53:51,232 --> 00:53:54,846
directed city staff not to respond to our questions. So I just want to make

860
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:58,154
sure should we be directing our concerns about this policy to council

861
00:53:58,282 --> 00:53:59,630
or to the mayor?

862
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:06,286
You can direct your questions to council if you

863
00:54:06,308 --> 00:54:10,130
have a direct question for council, if you have a question

864
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,126
that is specific to a director, you can submit

865
00:54:14,158 --> 00:54:18,162
those to your council office and we would send those to the director to

866
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:22,054
get a response for you. Right,

867
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,542
but the policy change that was made around

868
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:28,886
budget workshops that we hadn't had in previous years, I'm trying to

869
00:54:28,908 --> 00:54:32,086
figure out how we get that back. Yes,

870
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:36,154
council Member Cayman jason, just to be clear, I said

871
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:39,686
this before, I'm not chair of BFA, so I can't

872
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:42,346
speak for that. But what I do know as a chair of a committee is

873
00:54:42,368 --> 00:54:46,094
there is always, including at public safety been

874
00:54:46,212 --> 00:54:50,138
a standing procedural rule

875
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:53,120
where questions are taken from the public,

876
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:57,342
submitted to the departments and then responded to.

877
00:54:57,476 --> 00:55:00,754
My understanding is also in terms of time, things like

878
00:55:00,792 --> 00:55:04,306
that. We've already been here and I was going to thank

879
00:55:04,488 --> 00:55:08,146
Saba and others for sitting here all day. I understand

880
00:55:08,248 --> 00:55:11,746
the commitment. All I'm explaining is this wasn't

881
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:15,014
a rule change. The chair even

882
00:55:15,052 --> 00:55:18,646
indicated that we messed up the

883
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:22,074
first go round. It has always been in our

884
00:55:22,112 --> 00:55:25,546
committees that questions are submitted from

885
00:55:25,568 --> 00:55:28,938
the public, they're submitted to the departments for a response. For example,

886
00:55:29,024 --> 00:55:33,382
my staff takes all questions from public safety comments,

887
00:55:33,526 --> 00:55:37,438
submits them to department and then emails them back. So I just wanted again,

888
00:55:37,524 --> 00:55:41,022
I'm not telling you which way to feel about it, but I wanted

889
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:44,862
to speak up for the chair in terms of other

890
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:48,034
committees, that has been the standard process as

891
00:55:48,072 --> 00:55:48,660
well.

892
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:54,754
Right, but not for the budget workshops. We've been here in

893
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:58,990
previous years. So I just want to be clear about like, that's not general

894
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,200
practice and it hasn't been standard practice in previous years.

895
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:05,080
The recordings show it.

896
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:10,646
I've been sitting here for nine years doing this,

897
00:56:10,748 --> 00:56:13,994
so I think I know a little bit about it.

898
00:56:14,032 --> 00:56:16,710
But anyway, I appreciate your comments. Jason,

899
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:20,250
good to have you here this week. Jill Grochell,

900
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:35,358
star six to unmute. Jill saba

901
00:56:35,374 --> 00:56:37,880
Blanding. If Jill's in, we'll come back to you.

902
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,972
I had a couple of questions, but I believe what Jason

903
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:54,256
speaking to is the fact that last year we were able to

904
00:56:54,438 --> 00:56:57,756
direct our questions to the department heads during the budget

905
00:56:57,788 --> 00:57:01,104
workshops. I don't know if that

906
00:57:01,142 --> 00:57:04,452
was a change because it was virtual, but we definitely had the opportunity last

907
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:07,590
year, so I can't speak to prior years.

908
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,924
Thank you. We did a lot of different things during COVID when

909
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:15,448
everyone was virtual. So maybe we just need to

910
00:57:15,454 --> 00:57:19,028
go back to everything being virtual. I'm not a big fan of that, but you're

911
00:57:19,044 --> 00:57:22,696
right, we did a lot of different things last year in

912
00:57:22,718 --> 00:57:25,930
a virtual environment because of that. Yeah,

913
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,632
it was really nice and I appreciated it as a constituent, I don't disagree.

914
00:57:30,776 --> 00:57:34,460
In past workshops, we've been told that we start every day behind

915
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:38,156
based on low budget for staffing. And so in regards to trash, where are

916
00:57:38,178 --> 00:57:41,536
we in terms of the routes we have versus the routes we need based on

917
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:45,276
population growth? I believe there's a little bit of an addressing

918
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:48,770
routes, but just some more details there. And then

919
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,210
actually, several council members address this.

920
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,028
Do you mind if I ask a quick question? Go ahead. Okay, so we've been

921
00:57:57,034 --> 00:58:00,464
told in the past that solid waste needs somewhere around 40 million for additional personnel

922
00:58:00,512 --> 00:58:04,500
and equipment to get up to basic adequate level of service. Okay, so just

923
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:08,664
updates on that need for the immediate future. Council Member Alcorn and

924
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:11,604
Pollard, you both brought up the discussion of fees for solid waste.

925
00:58:11,652 --> 00:58:14,796
I'm just curious how this could be applied equitably so that every

926
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:18,140
Houstonian has access to trash collection and recycling

927
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,860
because illegal dumping is already an issue. And so just everyone

928
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:26,316
having access to trash and then,

929
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:30,284
yeah, that's it. Council Member

930
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:35,260
Pollard so I think we have to really strategically

931
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,384
look at how we put forth the fee. What does that fee get you?

932
00:58:38,422 --> 00:58:42,210
How is it equal across the board, especially when it comes to

933
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,976
those who may have resources and those who may not. So that's a discussion

934
00:58:47,008 --> 00:58:50,596
that we need to have before I think we do anything with the

935
00:58:50,618 --> 00:58:53,956
fee. I think we really need to educate the voters and

936
00:58:53,978 --> 00:58:56,932
the constituents on what's done in other cities.

937
00:58:56,996 --> 00:59:00,484
What can be expected here in this city? What are the pros?

938
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:03,880
Maybe some of the cons and some of the realistic expectations,

939
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,964
but it is a conversation that we need to have and we

940
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:11,164
really need to be able to hear your voice on that when we

941
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:15,070
bring forth what the possibilities are.

942
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,884
But we are the only city, major city in the state of Texas

943
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:23,260
and maybe even in the US. That does not have that fee.

944
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,924
And so we have to find ways in which, if we do pay a fee,

945
00:59:27,052 --> 00:59:30,276
all communities get a benefit and see

946
00:59:30,298 --> 00:59:34,228
a benefit beyond just normal trash, but also

947
00:59:34,314 --> 00:59:38,096
looking into the uniqueness of each area, whether it's illegal dumping

948
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,830
or whatever, to address those needs as well.

949
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,144
So I'll give you my personal deal. I get my

950
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:50,324
trash picked up by a contractor. I'm one of the folks

951
00:59:50,372 --> 00:59:53,816
that we get $6 a month from the city not

952
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,432
to pick up our trash. That goes to our homeowners association,

953
00:59:57,496 --> 01:00:00,808
who in turn pays for the private trash collection.

954
01:00:00,984 --> 01:00:04,696
We have what's called back door driveway

955
01:00:04,808 --> 01:00:07,916
trash collection. So they go down the street and they roll up to your

956
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:12,124
driveway and empty your can and dump it into a bigger can. Then the truck

957
01:00:12,172 --> 01:00:15,292
comes behind it, and we get that two days a week. Ours comes Tuesday,

958
01:00:15,356 --> 01:00:19,040
Friday. We have recycles pick up every Thursday.

959
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,660
So we are very happy with our

960
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:26,116
trash collection. So if we do go to our garbage fee and we

961
01:00:26,138 --> 01:00:29,632
have to change it, we better do equal

962
01:00:29,696 --> 01:00:33,000
or better, or I will get more complaints,

963
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,256
more complaints under the sun than I care to deal with.

964
01:00:37,438 --> 01:00:41,112
But one of the things that we had an issue

965
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:44,744
with five, six years ago I forgot when

966
01:00:44,782 --> 01:00:48,824
it was, was when we started looking at the elimination of private

967
01:00:48,872 --> 01:00:52,156
trash collection. We realized we didn't have the people and we didn't have the

968
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:55,608
equipment to do it. So I'm not sure what Sally

969
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:58,732
Alcorn has to say over there, but we love

970
01:00:58,786 --> 01:01:01,964
our private trash collection, and we pay for it, and we're glad

971
01:01:02,012 --> 01:01:05,376
to pay for it. So if I have to

972
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:08,988
sit here and vote for a garbage fee, and I argued with Harry Hayes for

973
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:12,980
years about it, it's going to be tough for me to do that,

974
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:16,992
because what we have works extremely

975
01:01:17,056 --> 01:01:20,564
well. All of the cities that

976
01:01:20,602 --> 01:01:24,064
I mentioned earlier on all of the cities that have the fee,

977
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:27,236
you can opt out of the fee and keep your private trash.

978
01:01:27,348 --> 01:01:30,632
Nobody's going to make anybody who has private trash get

979
01:01:30,686 --> 01:01:34,104
city trash. Can I quote you on that, Mayor? Mayor Al

980
01:01:34,142 --> 01:01:38,460
Corn because there's only one person that can state that, and he's up one floor.

981
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,332
Well, a fee that I would support would not

982
01:01:42,386 --> 01:01:45,400
require people to give up their private trash.

983
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,164
Let's quote let's run that tape back, broderick. Mr.

984
01:01:49,202 --> 01:01:53,568
Butler. Stop it. You got any additional yeah.

985
01:01:53,734 --> 01:01:57,424
And I appreciate Council Member Pollard address this I'm not worried about the constituents that

986
01:01:57,462 --> 01:02:01,008
can't afford the fee. I'm worried about those where, like, every dollar

987
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:04,500
is in them being able to access

988
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:08,100
trash and recycling, because we don't want to see that go there.

989
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,956
Okay, thank you. Thank you. I will not be here tomorrow, so thanks

990
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,790
for coming for every meeting. Thank you.

991
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,476
Stick around. I'll talk to you a little bit. Broad Butler,

992
01:02:19,508 --> 01:02:23,204
Northeast Houston, Myrtle Beach,

993
01:02:23,252 --> 01:02:26,456
South Carolina does an excellent job of

994
01:02:26,478 --> 01:02:29,692
eliminating illegal dumping. I wish you would take a look at their

995
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:33,980
plan. It went all the way to the state level. They have an agreement between

996
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,496
the city and the state to deal

997
01:02:37,538 --> 01:02:41,008
with illegal dumping. But my comments are I

998
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:44,764
want to apologize for losing my composure earlier. I respect the decision.

999
01:02:44,812 --> 01:02:48,736
I didn't expect you to reverse it. But to

1000
01:02:48,758 --> 01:02:52,624
sit here and be told. That well compensated, educated and seasoned

1001
01:02:52,672 --> 01:02:56,448
directors are being shielded from. Speaking to the public is frustrating.

1002
01:02:56,544 --> 01:02:59,796
But I apologize to the entire council for letting my

1003
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:03,000
passions get the better of me. I'd like to acknowledge

1004
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:07,236
the solid waste department on our side of town in Northeast

1005
01:03:07,268 --> 01:03:11,332
Houston. Alice Coffey, Richard Wynn, and Desmond Allen

1006
01:03:11,396 --> 01:03:14,824
are names that all Northeast residents know. They have

1007
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:18,028
worked harder. When they have failed, they have stepped up.

1008
01:03:18,114 --> 01:03:21,756
And everything that the director told you

1009
01:03:21,778 --> 01:03:25,496
about, we already know as citizens because we have a communication

1010
01:03:25,608 --> 01:03:29,520
and a dialogue with their staff. So outside

1011
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:32,944
of that, I wish every city department would resemble the

1012
01:03:32,982 --> 01:03:36,556
solid waste staff department. And again, Myrtle Beach,

1013
01:03:36,588 --> 01:03:40,836
South Carolina. So do you know anything about what they do? Because we

1014
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:44,884
talk about yeah, I read the whole plan one

1015
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:48,196
night when I was running for city council. Would you run

1016
01:03:48,218 --> 01:03:52,352
against I have no idea. But they were victorious,

1017
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:56,164
and we're going to go with it because in my eyes today, they stood

1018
01:03:56,212 --> 01:03:59,956
10ft tall. And I'll say that again, so I'm very proud of them. Myrtle Beach,

1019
01:03:59,988 --> 01:04:03,688
South Carolina. All I did one night, I said, everybody's got a

1020
01:04:03,694 --> 01:04:06,668
thought on this. And then I just went to the Google machine and I said,

1021
01:04:06,754 --> 01:04:10,216
give me the best solution for illegal dumping. It said, Myrtle Beach,

1022
01:04:10,248 --> 01:04:14,456
South Carolina. Their economy depends on tourism.

1023
01:04:14,568 --> 01:04:18,156
For people to come to this wonderful clear beach in South

1024
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:22,416
Carolina. But they had an economic downturn and

1025
01:04:22,438 --> 01:04:26,016
all this trash showed up. Nobody wanted tourists to

1026
01:04:26,038 --> 01:04:29,508
come and see a filthy city. They were going to lose millions of

1027
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:33,380
dollars. They came up with a garbage fee. It was $3.

1028
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:37,172
Ended up being $11. The fee was specific

1029
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:41,156
to hire only a team along

1030
01:04:41,258 --> 01:04:44,964
with their solid waste department. But that team only

1031
01:04:45,002 --> 01:04:48,616
went out and removed illegal dumping. I thought it didn't make

1032
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:51,576
a lot of sense, but as I talked to residents here, they didn't care how

1033
01:04:51,598 --> 01:04:54,856
it worked. They just want the trash gone. So Myrtle

1034
01:04:54,888 --> 01:04:58,572
Beach created a standalone hot

1035
01:04:58,626 --> 01:05:01,816
team. That's all they did. They went throughout

1036
01:05:01,848 --> 01:05:05,724
the entire city and removed trash, and it worked very

1037
01:05:05,762 --> 01:05:09,644
well. Then the city went to the legislature

1038
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:12,864
and asked them to increase the fines for people

1039
01:05:12,902 --> 01:05:16,416
who did illegal dumping. So they had to buy in from the

1040
01:05:16,438 --> 01:05:19,728
state, the county, and the state legislature. Sorry,

1041
01:05:19,894 --> 01:05:23,596
the city, the county, and the state legislature. So that if you

1042
01:05:23,638 --> 01:05:26,756
did dump in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, you were going to do

1043
01:05:26,778 --> 01:05:29,460
jail time and you were going to lose a whole lot of money.

1044
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:32,612
And so now Myrtle Beach is again,

1045
01:05:32,746 --> 01:05:36,728
they have one of the best responses to the issue, which is

1046
01:05:36,814 --> 01:05:40,056
basically, you come here, you dump, you will

1047
01:05:40,078 --> 01:05:43,396
either go to jail or you will be fined

1048
01:05:43,428 --> 01:05:46,696
into the Stone Age. And it has worked well for

1049
01:05:46,718 --> 01:05:49,070
them. I'm looking it up right now, and it's interesting.

1050
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,516
A lot of our issues emanates from the state of texas. And the reason why

1051
01:05:53,538 --> 01:05:56,844
I say that is we have a problem not with

1052
01:05:56,882 --> 01:06:00,304
illegal dumping, but with sand mining operations. And we discovered that

1053
01:06:00,342 --> 01:06:04,364
it was less expensive for them to keep illegally sending

1054
01:06:04,412 --> 01:06:07,808
sand into our tributaries than it is to remediate it.

1055
01:06:07,894 --> 01:06:10,896
So they kept doing it and they kept paying the fines and they paid them

1056
01:06:10,918 --> 01:06:14,436
gladly. But you won't solve that problem until you raise the

1057
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:18,496
fines high enough to where it actually hurts them. And it sounds like reading

1058
01:06:18,528 --> 01:06:22,164
on Myrtle Beach that's exactly what they did through the state.

1059
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:25,684
And they got the buy in so that they weren't a standalone island

1060
01:06:25,812 --> 01:06:28,996
trying to solve a problem that other cities were eventually

1061
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:32,456
going to have in South Carolina. Right. Well, I'll finish reading it, but your other

1062
01:06:32,478 --> 01:06:37,164
comment no need to apologize. I appreciate your

1063
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:40,824
vigor and vitality. I think I'm somewhat

1064
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,996
like that. Well, but reason people should be able

1065
01:06:44,018 --> 01:06:47,692
to have a discourse because at the end of the day, some of these

1066
01:06:47,746 --> 01:06:51,792
directors, they don't deal with apparati, they deal with people's lives.

1067
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:55,836
So it kind of matters to us that we're the lives they might be dealing

1068
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:59,148
with one day. Thank you. We appreciate

1069
01:06:59,244 --> 01:07:02,884
the efforts of the council and thank you for your time. You got

1070
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:06,944
it. Thank you. Before we adjourn, please note budget workshops
