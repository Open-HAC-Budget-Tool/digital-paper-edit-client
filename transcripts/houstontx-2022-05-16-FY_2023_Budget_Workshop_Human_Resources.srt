1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,990
We will now transition to Human resources.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,958
Since we are more than an hour behind, we are foregoing our break

3
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:12,634
to be respectful of department representatives. So we're

4
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:14,720
self sacrificing today.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,360
We do have a few snacks if you'd like,

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,062
but I'm helping with you all with the weight loss program for the

7
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:27,400
of Houston. As HR is here,

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,890
who's running the department.

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,460
It's just like a machine, right?

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,662
Absolutely. Well oiled. I love it. I love it.

11
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:51,246
That's how well we do it. Yes. At this

12
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:54,746
time, I'd like to welcome Director Jane Cheeks and Carla Coleman

13
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:58,634
as they will provide the human Resource department budget presentation.

14
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:02,306
Good to have you. Thank you very much. And I apologize in

15
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,218
advance, of course. I know we apologize to you for I get horse on the

16
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:08,866
day that I have to present, but Carla has my

17
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:12,194
back. I want to thank you all and

18
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:16,040
good afternoon, Chair and Vice Chair and Council members.

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,654
I, along with Carla Coleman, assistant Director of HR

20
00:01:20,722 --> 00:01:24,986
Finance, are pleased today to present

21
00:01:25,088 --> 00:01:28,422
our FY 23 HR

22
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:32,326
budget presentation. I'm also enjoying by my executive

23
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:36,014
staff, which I'll introduce shortly. The city

24
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:40,410
of Houston has over 21,000 employees

25
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,082
and HR touches every one of them. Whether it's facilitating

26
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:49,038
health and wellness, enhancing workplace safety,

27
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:52,702
providing opportunities for training and development,

28
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,798
caring for injured workers, working towards pay equity

29
00:01:56,894 --> 00:02:00,438
or recruitment, and onboarding, we never

30
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:04,626
forget the human element of our department's

31
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:08,134
name. Our primary purpose is

32
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:11,606
to provide opportunities for transformational

33
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:15,370
public service careers in an efficient and cost

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,746
effective manner, all while complying with a

35
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:22,810
variety of local, state and federal mandates.

36
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,520
Next slide please.

37
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,926
Next slide please. As you can see from our

38
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:34,474
organizational structure, I have ten divisions.

39
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:38,622
We will be discussing them more in detail further

40
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:42,034
in the presentation. But let me pause for 2

41
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:45,918
seconds just to introduce my team. Elisa Franklin Brocks

42
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:49,446
is my chief of staff. Darren Hilton is

43
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:52,070
my deputy director of HR operations.

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,906
Carla Coleman is my chief financial officer.

45
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:59,670
Charles Smith is my assistant Director of Risk Management.

46
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,580
Veronica Davis is my assistant Director of Benefits.

47
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,450
Katina Swift is my chief learning officer.

48
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,450
Velma Laws is the assistant chief policy officer.

49
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,014
Abdi Sdecki is my deputy assistant Director over

50
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:20,106
Human Resources Information Management. Bob Johnson

51
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:23,466
is my compensation manager. And Leslie Denton

52
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:27,106
roach is over HR Communications. And I

53
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:31,486
would be remiss if I didn't introduce Aisha Roberts as the Deputy

54
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:35,022
Assistant director over HR operations. And Stefan

55
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:38,334
Mahal. He's the deputy assistant director.

56
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:42,342
Director over risk management. I also have the team

57
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:46,278
that tirelessly helped me put this benefits budget together.

58
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:50,520
So Carla, would you introduce your team? Yes, my team, please stand up.

59
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,660
The financial team, please stand up.

60
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,234
I can't hear you, I'm sorry. So this is the core team that

61
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:01,930
actually worked late nights in putting this budget numbers together.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,614
So without them, I wouldn't be able to present here today. So I thank

63
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:08,800
you and I acknowledge the hard work that they put in.

64
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,120
Thank you, Taylor. Thank you.

65
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,140
Next slide, please.

66
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,022
This slide shows a diverse range of statutes

67
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:26,846
which we must comply to. Our goal is to administer

68
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:32,242
all compliance initiatives in a manner that minimizes

69
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:36,002
risk and maximizes compliance with each statute,

70
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:40,082
thus shielding the city from potential penalties

71
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:43,942
and legal cost. Mayor Turner

72
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:47,690
often speaks about incrementalist. He states

73
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,530
we should be transformational.

74
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,874
We made some major strides here in the HR Department

75
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:58,414
department in FY 22, one being the

76
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:03,230
passage of the Prenatal Parental and Infant Wellness Ordinance.

77
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,958
The next one will be one of our largest projects,

78
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:10,990
the HR One project, which is a collaboration

79
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,086
with Director Kent and the Hits team and Director Piyas

80
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:18,758
in the Payroll team, where we will implement Success

81
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:22,646
Factors and Employee central. We are also

82
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:25,800
implementing a new platform, Benefits Focus,

83
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,230
for our benefits administration. We will make history

84
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,758
with the Benefit Focus implementation by finally ridding

85
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:38,486
our valued retirees of a paper intensive

86
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:41,914
process of electing and changing their

87
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:45,450
benefits. Both Success Factors

88
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,690
and Benefit Focus will offer the mobility

89
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,350
function which is crucial in our digital transformation.

90
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,234
Another major project in HR is zero is

91
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:02,180
possible. It's called zip. Our safety program.

92
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,610
We have been instrumental in leading safety from top to bottom

93
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,454
by providing all employees, from directors to

94
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:14,994
frontline workers, with the understanding that zero accidents

95
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:19,106
are truly possible. We are also implementing several

96
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:22,634
new technical services to assist us in providing a

97
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:27,098
higher level of customer service, such as analytical data

98
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:30,410
through power bi. Next slide.

99
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,706
With our strong commitment to technological advancement,

100
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:41,338
the footprint we will leave on our organization

101
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:44,782
will be a model of how HR should

102
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:48,674
conduct business in municipalities for years to come.

103
00:06:48,872 --> 00:06:52,654
Today we will present our FY proposed budget.

104
00:06:52,782 --> 00:06:57,278
We have reviewed the services that HR provides

105
00:06:57,374 --> 00:07:00,658
to our client department and integrated

106
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,614
all the HR functions residing in the General Fund into

107
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:08,514
our Central Services Revolving Fund. The mayor's

108
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:12,502
higher Houston youth program will be the only thing that will remain

109
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,706
in our general fund. This will allow

110
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:19,670
more efficiency, more efficient

111
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,290
delivery of services for HR.

112
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,594
Now I will turn the presentation over to my CFO

113
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:30,686
to discuss the budget further. Thank you,

114
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,230
Director Cheeks. And good afternoon,

115
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,130
Chair. Vice Chair. Mayor Per term and council members.

116
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,806
So, what you have in front of you is the functional

117
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:47,954
chart for HR, which is proposed a budget of $514,000,000 and

118
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:51,110
it funds 448.7 FTEs.

119
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,710
And this is done through five funds. We have a General fund,

120
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,598
two revolving funds and two Internal Services Fund.

121
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:02,810
In the General Fund, we are proposing a budget of 1.5 million

122
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,554
to fund 152.7 FTE for the

123
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:09,706
Hara Houston Youth Program. Then in

124
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:13,174
the revolving funds, we have the Central Service Revolving Fund,

125
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:16,510
which the proposed budget is 38 million

126
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,934
and it funds 185 FTE and

127
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:23,514
the budget is 8% of the combined HR

128
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:27,534
budget. Then the other revolving fund is the Workers Compensation

129
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:31,234
Fund, which the proposed budget is 45 million. And it

130
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:35,170
funds 60 FTEs and it represents 9%

131
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,834
of the combined HR budget. And then from

132
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:42,342
the Internal Revenue Internal Services Fund we have the Health

133
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:47,046
Benefit Fund which is budgeted at 428,000,000 and

134
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:51,402
it funds 51 FTEs and it represents 85%

135
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:55,190
of HR's budget. And lastly the Long Term Disability

136
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,538
Fund which is budgeted at 1.6 million,

137
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:02,646
represents less than 1% of the HR's

138
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:06,074
budgeted fund and it doesn't have any personnel associated

139
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:08,400
with it. Next slide please.

140
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,230
This is the functional chart for the General

141
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,826
Fund and as I mentioned, the only thing funded here is the Har

142
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:20,306
Houston Youth for 1.5 million and

143
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:25,170
it funds 152.7 FTEs or 509

144
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,914
positions. We have expecting 500 interns

145
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:32,520
and nine career coaches. Next slide please.

146
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,654
This is the central revolving fund for HR and

147
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:41,194
the proposed budget is $38 million and it

148
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:44,780
funds 185 FTEs in seven

149
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,302
divisions. We are integrating the HR General Funds

150
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:52,700
operational functions into this fund,

151
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,242
so we are funding 185 FTEs.

152
00:09:57,386 --> 00:10:00,474
In addition to the HR functions,

153
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:04,094
core functions that this budget holds, we also have

154
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:08,686
the budget for contingent workforce and for the training and organizational

155
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:12,020
development of the city. Next slide please.

156
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,906
This is the Workers Compensation Fund and the proposed budget

157
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:24,214
is 45 million and it funds 60 FTEs and

158
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:28,306
three major functions managed by two divisions.

159
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:31,706
The Safety and the Workers compensation functions are

160
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:35,034
managed by the HR Risk Management Division and their

161
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:38,854
mission is to create a safe work environment by eliminating workplace

162
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:42,326
hazard, reducing the financial impact associated

163
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:46,910
with the workplace injuries and by being advocates to our injured workers.

164
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,374
Next slide please. This is

165
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:54,574
the Health Benefit Fund and the proposed budget is

166
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,910
428,000,000 and it funds 51 FTEs

167
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,322
and four major functions managed by four

168
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:06,286
divisions. This budget houses all the benefit plans

169
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:09,778
for the city which includes the medical and the pharmacy plans,

170
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:13,320
the supplemental plans such as dental, vision, life insurance,

171
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,458
life dependent care, flexible spending

172
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:21,660
and two Medicare Advantage plans for retirees over 65.

173
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,434
Next slide please. And the long

174
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:29,162
term disability fund, which is budgeted at 1.6

175
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:32,714
million. It doesn't have any personnel associated with it and

176
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:36,010
this fund is mostly determined by an annual actuary

177
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,280
evaluation and it happens at year end.

178
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,446
Next slide please. Now this is

179
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:47,662
the revenue slide for most departments

180
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:51,314
and this chart compares the proposed budget for

181
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:55,570
next fiscal year with this current year's estimate.

182
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,962
So I want to say that HR is not a revenue generating department,

183
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:04,966
so our revenues are products of chargebacks to

184
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:08,134
the departments for actual program and services

185
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:12,058
and based on utilization. And also it's a

186
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,562
product of contribution from employees, retirees and

187
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:19,354
city departments. So this chart shows an increase of

188
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:22,346
9.5% or 45 million.

189
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:23,820
Next slide please.

190
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,564
Now this slide covers the key drivers that increases

191
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:33,796
the proposed revenues, but they are the same key drivers

192
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:37,596
that are actually increasing the expense sites. So we'll talk

193
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:41,256
about them later in the expense sites because they're exactly the same as we're

194
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:44,910
not a revenue generating department. Next slide please.

195
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,684
So this is the expend budget for HR

196
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:54,012
and this chart compares the FY 23 proposed

197
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:57,904
budget with this year's current budget. And as you can

198
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:01,744
see, the 23 budget is proposed with

199
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:05,910
an increase of 23 million or 4.7%.

200
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,750
Next slide please.

201
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,076
This slide actually has the key drivers for both

202
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:17,412
the revenue and the expenses. And this 23

203
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:20,856
million is broken down as follows. So we see first the

204
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:23,992
General Fund that has a decrease of 2.5 million,

205
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:29,064
or 62.1%, and mainly this is to the

206
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:32,620
merger of the HR operations activities and the General

207
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,884
Fund with a Central Service Revolving Fund. So the only

208
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:39,180
thing left in the General fund is the har Houston youth.

209
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,360
Then the next thing we have is the Central Revolving Fund which

210
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,720
increased by 6.9 million or 20%,

211
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,044
and the increases are due to increased

212
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:53,068
utilization in temporary service personnel.

213
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:57,264
And we also added this year the fire department officer

214
00:13:57,392 --> 00:14:01,044
ranking exam for captain and senior captain. We also have

215
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:04,800
personnel increases due to hope and benefits as well as cost

216
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,320
increases for technology initiatives that Director Cheeks mentioned earlier.

217
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,600
The Workers Compensation Fund increased by 6.1 million or 15%,

218
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,772
mostly due to catastrophic high claims related to COVID.

219
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:21,820
We also have personnel increases in this fund as well.

220
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,340
And then the health benefit increase of 13 million

221
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,372
or 3.1 is mostly due to premium rate increases of

222
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:33,344
6.5% from 3.4% last year. We also

223
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:36,976
have high claim cost in this fund related to

224
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:40,608
COVID and personnel increases across the board for benefits

225
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:44,770
and hope. And then the long term disability also has

226
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,460
an increase in rates which increased the budget by 85,000

227
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,660
or 5%. But the increase is mostly due to

228
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,820
participation count increases which drives the claim increases

229
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,130
as well. Next slide, please.

230
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,540
Now in the next six slides we're going to see the HR's budget

231
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,272
allocated between personnel and non personnel cost.

232
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:12,952
In this slide in front of you, you have the proposed budget combined

233
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:17,452
budget of 514,000,000. It allocates 7%

234
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:21,872
of this budget to personnel to fund 448.7

235
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:26,176
FTEs and this is done with $34 million.

236
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:30,604
Then the 93% remaining of the budget goes to non personnel expenses

237
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:34,132
or other expenses for 480,000,000.

238
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:34,884
Out of this,

239
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:39,360
480,000,076% is allocated

240
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,168
to claim expenses for the benefit funds.

241
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:47,284
Then 11% goes to other health benefit

242
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:51,256
plans which includes supplemental plans and retirees plans. Then it

243
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,396
goes to Workers Compensation claims for 8% and the remaining of the budget

244
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:59,020
goes to other services, supplies and restricted accounts.

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,310
Next slide please.

246
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,264
This one is the allocation of the General Fund budget for Har Houston

247
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:10,072
Youth, and it allocates 98% of its budget to

248
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:13,952
personnel to fund 152.7

249
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,468
FTEs, or 509 positions,

250
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:20,610
and the remainder of the budget of 31,000.

251
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,740
You find it allocated to other services and supplies.

252
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,550
Next slide please.

253
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,396
The revolving funds budget which is set at

254
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:34,976
38 million, allocates 53% of that budget

255
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:38,660
to personnel to fund 185 FTEs

256
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,312
and then the remaining 47% to fund the other

257
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:46,056
person non personnel cost of 18 million. Out of

258
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,804
this, 18,000,087% of that goes to

259
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,768
other services for 16 million and the remainder goes to restricted accounts

260
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:57,870
and supplies. Next slide please.

261
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,664
The workers compensation fund budgeted at 45 million.

262
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:07,152
Allocates 15% of that budget to

263
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:11,856
personnel for 60 FTEs and then 85%

264
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:15,296
goes to non personnel expenses. And out of this

265
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:18,964
38 million, which is represent 85%,

266
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:22,964
97% of that is just claims experience and

267
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:26,840
the remainder you will find in other services, restricted and

268
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,960
supplies, which is just 13% of that budget.

269
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,330
Next slide please.

270
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,950
Here you see the health benefit which is budgeted $428,000,000.

271
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,364
Only 1% of that budget is allocated to personnel for

272
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:47,724
only 50 funding, 51 FTEs. The rest of this

273
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:51,288
budget, which is 422, 87% of

274
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:55,312
that is allocated to health benefit claims, then 12%

275
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,956
of that is allocated to the other health benefit plans,

276
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:02,604
supplemental plans and retirees, and the remainder goes to other

277
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:05,220
services, restricted accounts and supplies.

278
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,380
Next slide please. Lastly, we have

279
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,924
the Long term Disability Fund which has no personnel

280
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:19,400
associated with it. So 98% of the 1.6

281
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,644
proposed budget goes to fund claims

282
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:26,196
expenses and the other 2% goes to TPA fees

283
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:29,896
and actuarial service at the end of the year. Next slide

284
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:33,724
please. This is

285
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:37,276
the net change for the General Fund for HR. And as you can

286
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:41,292
see, HR for this fiscal year has two components, the operational

287
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:45,024
budget and the Har Houston Youth Program. This budget was

288
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:49,292
reduced by a net reduction of 20,000 for adjustments

289
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:53,632
to restricted account, hope and health benefit. It further

290
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:57,492
has a reduction of 2.5 and that is to

291
00:18:57,546 --> 00:19:00,724
merge the operational activities in the General Fund into

292
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:04,772
the Central Service Revolving Fund. And the only thing

293
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:08,024
left in this budget is 1.5, which funds the higher

294
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:11,720
Houston youth. So the net change from 22 to 23

295
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,490
is a reduction of 62.1%.

296
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,188
Next slide and council members,

297
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:23,884
this concludes the financial presentations for the budget at

298
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:27,464
HR, but I pass back to Director Cheese for closing

299
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:30,960
remarks. Thank you. Thank you, Carla.

300
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,976
Thank you, Carla. I like to thank my

301
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:38,176
executive staff and every HR employee for

302
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:41,728
the hard work they put in continuously each day

303
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:45,492
to service our client departments and council members.

304
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:50,004
I'd like to thank you also, thank you for supporting us

305
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,856
as we continue to optimize our HR journey.

306
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:57,780
Do you have any questions for us today? Yes. Council member Abby Cayman.

307
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,384
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. First off, Director, to you and your

308
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:05,416
entire team. Thank you. It has certainly not been an

309
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:09,112
easy few years. I was looking back over the accomplishments

310
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:12,796
that you listed and even when I

311
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:16,124
approached you a few years ago, one parental leave,

312
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:20,624
which is a massive accomplishment, but even including additional insurance

313
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:23,724
program benefits like healthy babies,

314
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:26,450
healthy pregnancy. But on top of all of that,

315
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,280
you dealt with COVID you dealt with implementing a system

316
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,804
for testing for the city you had to deal with. We talked

317
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:38,656
about NIT Kronos and those issues challenge after challenge

318
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:42,132
after challenge, and you all continue to serve. So thank you for that.

319
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:46,752
I also just wanted to, again, just spotlight

320
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:50,152
my appreciation for you as a director. You always

321
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:54,116
take our calls. You work with us, of course, under Mayor Turner's

322
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:57,416
leadership. But thank you for pushing the ball forward for the

323
00:20:57,438 --> 00:21:01,476
city in leading the way again as a city

324
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:05,416
for the entire country. It's phenomenal. And again, to your entire staff,

325
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:08,156
I'm looking at a few in particular. It's just a pleasure to work with you

326
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:12,076
all. So congratulations. Thank you. And I forgot to ask my

327
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:15,856
department question that I ask everyone. Due to the

328
00:21:15,878 --> 00:21:19,292
financial constraints currently faced by the city of Houston,

329
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:22,508
what are needs that are not addressed in this budget that you would like us

330
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:23,590
to be aware of?

331
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,670
What needs that are not?

332
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,310
Wow.

333
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,280
Council Member, I want to tell you, I'm sure everybody

334
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,544
is having staffing issues. And at the end

335
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:43,368
of the day, HR is not the

336
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:47,412
same for HR. We are diligently trying

337
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:51,404
to staff our vacancies, and that's just something that

338
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:54,972
is challenging not only for the city,

339
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:59,356
but throughout the United States right now. So we

340
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:03,024
continue to just make sure that we provide the

341
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:07,008
highest level of customer service, but we'll continue to staff up.

342
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:10,332
Well, again, I appreciate everything in the partnership.

343
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:13,856
Thank you. Thank you. Council Member Michael Kubosh

344
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:17,476
director Cheeks. This has been a real tough two years for

345
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:20,756
me and my wife. Yes, sir. And you

346
00:22:20,778 --> 00:22:24,372
know it. Yes, sir. And you were there. You always

347
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,580
took my call. Yes, sir. You always helped

348
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,640
me. And I'm grateful to you and your staff

349
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,512
because it's been a tough time. I broke my leg.

350
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:38,520
My wife's had four surgeries, been rough.

351
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,190
And I appreciate because a lot of times

352
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,916
I don't know the inner workings of how it goes. So I just go to

353
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:49,436
you. Yes, sir. Then you

354
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,576
may say, well, and you've never said, I'm not the one to go to on

355
00:22:52,598 --> 00:22:56,444
this. You just fix it. You help me get it together. And I'm

356
00:22:56,492 --> 00:23:00,960
forever grateful for it. And I'm thankful that

357
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,660
you're the head of this department at this time in my life.

358
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,564
God bless you and thank you for your service to our city. And I thank

359
00:23:08,602 --> 00:23:12,512
all of you with Human resources.

360
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:17,056
Council Member Sally Alcorn. Thank you, chair in the Central Service Revolving

361
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:20,900
Fund, the $12.3 million in contingent workforce contracts,

362
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,090
can you describe what those are specifically? The one for the general fund.

363
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,036
Go ahead. So we have two contracts, one for the

364
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:33,084
general fund, one for special revolving fund. We established that last year

365
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:38,104
when we saw the need of grant funded departments

366
00:23:38,232 --> 00:23:42,124
actually incurring more staffing and we had budget constraints.

367
00:23:42,252 --> 00:23:46,572
So according to those budget constraints

368
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:51,244
and their operational needs, that's why it's increasing. So primarily

369
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:55,068
COVID related then? Well, at the beginning, it was COVID related.

370
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:58,912
We have a lot of grants that are still COVID related for some departments.

371
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:02,756
Okay. I might ask for some more details on that. In the health benefits fund,

372
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,308
the increase $25

373
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:10,036
a month, I believe, in the limited plan. Is that just in the Kelsey

374
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:13,464
plan that employees will be paying $25 a month

375
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:16,856
more to address the 6.5% increase, or are

376
00:24:16,878 --> 00:24:20,732
those across all plans? So the $25

377
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:24,940
surcharge, you're talking about $25 as it's described,

378
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,532
for the limited plan. So, yes, it's across

379
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:33,480
the board. Yes, ma'am. That's an additional additional

380
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,704
towards the premium that employees will

381
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:40,384
pay in the next year to address the rise in those costs. Yes,

382
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:44,496
ma'am. And that will be the first time in three years, council Member or Alcorn,

383
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:48,112
that we have actually had a charge to the employees,

384
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:52,116
because up until now we have done zero for

385
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:55,364
the employees. Okay. So the city has been absorbing any

386
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:58,616
increases and this is passing that one. Okay. I understand $12 on

387
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:02,068
the health surcharge. There is a line item with the health surcharge,

388
00:25:02,164 --> 00:25:05,384
$2.9 million. What is that?

389
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:09,550
So those are expenses that we budget for

390
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,964
any wellness revenues that we receive. And so as

391
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:18,748
we receive it, we have to expense them. So that's what you see in that

392
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:22,476
line item. I'm not

393
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:26,096
sure I understand that answer. We're calling it a health

394
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:28,832
surcharge. $2.9 million,

395
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:32,284
expense of the account. But those are expenses

396
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:35,360
that we're budgeting for any wellness.

397
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,008
So there's a revenue component to that equals two expenses.

398
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,720
So if there's any wellness revenue that we receive

399
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,212
for health assessments not completed okay,

400
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:50,164
that's where I was going. That's people that did not complete their health

401
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:53,864
assessments, $2.9 million worth of people

402
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:57,636
that didn't do that. Where's the spouse surcharge? Line item?

403
00:25:57,748 --> 00:26:01,276
It's included in the revenue in the contribution side. For the

404
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:05,208
revenue side, I'd like to get an amount for that spouse surcharge

405
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:08,030
that we're getting annually. Thank you. I'll submit the rest online.

406
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,164
Thank you. Director Chiefs, I'll ask a question I

407
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:16,656
sort of asked the other day when we had our five year forecast and some

408
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:20,096
of the challenges that we're seeing, not only in the

409
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:24,256
city of Houston and corporate America, as well as workforce challenges

410
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:28,000
trying to get new employees, trying to maintain

411
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,620
existing employees.

412
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,752
I'm sure you get involved in a lot of pre employment interviews

413
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:40,344
and hopefully you're getting involved in a lot of exit interviews to find

414
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:43,560
out why people are leaving and going elsewhere if they choose

415
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,784
that option. When you talk to people back

416
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:51,304
years ago when the workforce was a little bit

417
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,684
different and pre COVID, I think a lot of things have

418
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:58,844
changed. And the reason why I'm saying that I'm trying to figure out

419
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:03,212
when you interview potential applicants, and I'll ask your department

420
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:07,040
leaders for this as well, and when you talk to folks about

421
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,080
why they're leaving the city of Houston and going elsewhere,

422
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,908
there's a number of dynamics that come into play.

423
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:16,820
Salary, vacation.

424
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,444
Some are looking for travel opportunities maybe that they don't get here

425
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:24,944
at the city of Houston. And family life balance

426
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:28,808
issues. One of the things we addressed just about a month ago with

427
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:32,488
parental leave and things like that, that will go a long way to

428
00:27:32,654 --> 00:27:35,800
have us maintain and attract employees.

429
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,364
Where do you see retirement benefits come

430
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:44,764
into play when you talk to prospective employees or

431
00:27:44,882 --> 00:27:48,140
employees that are leaving to go to corporate America?

432
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,528
That's a very good question. You specifically said

433
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:56,588
retirement benefits. So in my conversations

434
00:27:56,684 --> 00:28:00,112
with respect to retirement benefits, they are not

435
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:03,804
normally the driving factor for those individuals that are leaving

436
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:07,492
the city. Most of the individuals that are actually coming into

437
00:28:07,546 --> 00:28:11,350
the city, sir, they are looking at our salary and our benefits.

438
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,716
A lot of people leaving private sector are attracted to our benefits.

439
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:19,396
One, because believe it or not, they are cheaper. They are cheaper

440
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:23,636
than what individuals are paying right out of their pocket in the private sector,

441
00:28:23,748 --> 00:28:27,144
especially because of what the city contributes to those to

442
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:31,020
that. But as far as the retirement, we are

443
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,780
millennials and I say that do not give them a bad rap.

444
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,216
They are employees who want to work and they work very

445
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:43,516
hard. They're looking for their money and they're

446
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:47,040
looking to get paid. And retirement

447
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,730
is not something that they're looking at right away. Let me say it like that.

448
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,870
In my world, people look for

449
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,000
salary, family life balance with proper vacation,

450
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,212
medical coverage, et cetera, and other

451
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:09,832
issues related to give me my money today and

452
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:13,304
give me a comfortable living today where I can do

453
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:17,032
things and have the opportunity to have some time off and spend

454
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:21,032
with my wife or my husband

455
00:29:21,096 --> 00:29:22,670
when we have kids.

456
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,244
And I believe that the way

457
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:31,100
we look at the next 30 years with our long term liability in the city,

458
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,464
it's going to continue to grow. And the only

459
00:29:34,502 --> 00:29:38,364
way to not have it grow is to move to a different blended

460
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:42,176
type retirement plan. But when you do that and you

461
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:45,396
have the ability to start reducing your expenses, this is

462
00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:48,996
something that's going to happen over the next 30 to 40 years when

463
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:52,596
a lot of folks like me will be in

464
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:55,736
another world and not collecting the

465
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:59,272
retirement pay that we collected or other

466
00:29:59,326 --> 00:30:02,852
employees. So if you address the employees

467
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:06,648
who are buying salary, who are buying family life

468
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:09,260
and are not buying retirement,

469
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,744
aren't we losing when we don't raise salaries to compensate

470
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:18,444
for a decrease on the benefit side?

471
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:23,468
The benefits being the retirement pay, the defined

472
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:26,960
contribution benefit plan versus moving

473
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,864
to some type of a blended 401 or what

474
00:30:30,902 --> 00:30:34,356
other states and cities around the United States are doing in the

475
00:30:34,378 --> 00:30:35,620
government sector.

476
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,136
It's a question, but I think it's a question we need to explore

477
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:44,692
because if our young millennials, as you call them,

478
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:48,232
are not buying defined benefits and

479
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:51,688
are buying give me more money today and let me manage

480
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:55,348
my retirement. We're selling stuff they're

481
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:58,644
not buying, thus they're not going to come to us. Thus they're going to leave

482
00:30:58,702 --> 00:31:01,816
to go to corporate America where guess what? They will be dealing

483
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:05,390
with 401, not defined benefits.

484
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,484
So my argument on this, and before I leave

485
00:31:09,522 --> 00:31:13,932
in a year and a half, I'd love to understand what drives

486
00:31:14,076 --> 00:31:17,344
the employees of the city of Houston today. And if

487
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:21,056
it's because they have a defined benefit plan, I'll be

488
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:24,188
the first one to say we'll stick with it. But I don't think they're

489
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:27,920
buying what we're selling. They're not buying the defined benefit.

490
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,732
They're buying give me more money today, give me a good family life

491
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:35,296
balance, I want some good vacation and I want parental

492
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:38,970
leave when I have kids for twelve weeks or whatever that is.

493
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,892
What do you think? You see it every day. You're the Director of HR.

494
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:48,472
I'm not. Well, let me tell you that our pension is

495
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:52,696
very attractive, sir. And how many different pension plans do we have for employees

496
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:55,580
that are working today? Is it four or five? It's four.

497
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,876
It's four different plans? Yes, we have four different plans. So the

498
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:02,252
defined benefit is still good. Let me tell you

499
00:32:02,306 --> 00:32:05,456
just give me 2 seconds or two minutes. No, you have all the time in

500
00:32:05,478 --> 00:32:08,176
the world. No, I know you all are. We're only running late by an hour

501
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:11,616
and a half. But that's okay. What I definitely want

502
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,604
to emphasize is that I might have answered that a little bit different two

503
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,076
years ago before COVID came. Okay. All right, I might have

504
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:22,784
answered that. So before COVID

505
00:32:22,832 --> 00:32:25,992
hit, we pre COVID, we did not have that many

506
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:31,064
people retiring. When COVID started, we had two to 3%

507
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,170
more people retiring. They were like, Listen,

508
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,788
we're going to leave now. But one thing I want

509
00:32:37,794 --> 00:32:41,176
to tell you that really affected this, even the millennials,

510
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:44,556
is that people now are looking at

511
00:32:44,578 --> 00:32:48,344
their family life different because people died.

512
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:52,604
Vice Mayor Pro TEM and they're looking at their coworkers

513
00:32:52,652 --> 00:32:55,836
that are no longer here. Mothers, fathers,

514
00:32:55,948 --> 00:33:00,210
sisters, brothers, all of them. They're looking at the fact that

515
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,320
they need to look at work differently.

516
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,180
And I don't believe that it's the defined benefit.

517
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,024
We have done well with the administration raising up our salaries,

518
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:16,304
stabilizing the pension, and doing all of those

519
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:20,296
things. What's most important right now to a lot

520
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:23,912
of people, not just the people that are just coming to the city,

521
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:27,524
it is truly being able to have that

522
00:33:27,582 --> 00:33:31,164
flexibility here in the workplace. And I want to tell you

523
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:35,432
that the pension is still very appeasing

524
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:40,248
to even millennials. It's just that COVID

525
00:33:40,344 --> 00:33:43,490
actually changed the way people think.

526
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,856
Right now, individuals are looking at our benefits from

527
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:51,136
having more mental stability within the

528
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:54,790
workplace. Our benefits are making a difference.

529
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,060
Our wellness is making a difference. And that is

530
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,356
actually attracting people because wellness is big in

531
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:06,312
the private sector. So when they come and see how robust our

532
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:10,216
wellness program is, how they're looking at our benefits

533
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:13,636
and how we pay such close attention to the mental

534
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:17,640
stability of our employees, that is very important.

535
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,908
Because right now in the United States,

536
00:34:21,074 --> 00:34:24,764
how we look at mental stability, whether you are young,

537
00:34:24,882 --> 00:34:28,040
whether you are middle aged, or you are more tenured,

538
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,210
that is something that is being paid attention to. Vice Mayor Pro TEM

539
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,400
she's the Vice Mayor Pro TEM I know,

540
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,204
but my thing is we have four separate retirement

541
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:43,744
plans. What about studying a fifth plan? And that

542
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:47,632
fifth plan will be, if you don't value retirement play

543
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:51,700
on the fine benefit side, then I'm not going to give it to you,

544
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,190
but I'm going to pay you X percent more,

545
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,670
5%, 10%.

546
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:04,152
What are people going to do? What will people choose my

547
00:35:04,206 --> 00:35:07,416
age? They're going to choose a defined benefit, of course. But I think

548
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,464
the new employees that we're getting aren't valuing again, what we're selling,

549
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:15,070
we're selling that we can give them more on the base side

550
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,564
and this thing will soften out in a number of years as

551
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:23,136
you have those employees that retire and move away from

552
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:26,448
the defined benefit plan. But anyway,

553
00:35:26,614 --> 00:35:30,256
thank you. Just things to discuss. I'd love to have a consultant look

554
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:34,524
at it and see how this plays not only in the other government arenas,

555
00:35:34,572 --> 00:35:37,904
but also in relationship to where are we losing

556
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:41,652
the people to? Are we losing them to Harris County? Are we losing them to

557
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,836
Chevron? Who are we losing them to and why are

558
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:48,244
we not competitive? Is it salary that's

559
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:52,056
driving them? Because they're surely not going to

560
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:55,764
leave because we have a great salary

561
00:35:55,812 --> 00:35:59,740
package. Maybe they'll stay for the defined benefit. Council Member Pollard

562
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,820
thank you, Mayor Pro tim, I think that's an interesting point that you're making,

563
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,484
and I think based on an individual's perspective on how

564
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:11,096
they look at their own life trajectory

565
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:14,668
and their own savings and their own current lifestyle

566
00:36:14,764 --> 00:36:18,016
and what they may choose. So I think that is interesting from

567
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:21,424
an HR perspective, though, we keep hearing, like the

568
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:24,676
great resignation. Does the

569
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:28,580
city of Houston put forth non competes

570
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,692
for new hires? So if a person comes in

571
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:34,660
in a certain department,

572
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,620
are we able to put forth a non compete clause

573
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,856
or a mandatory stay clause that if you

574
00:36:44,878 --> 00:36:48,868
get hired here, you must stay for X amount of time, or if

575
00:36:48,894 --> 00:36:52,812
you do leave, you cannot take another job

576
00:36:52,866 --> 00:36:56,430
in a similar field? Are we allowed to do that? Do we do that?

577
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,748
We have worked with the legal department on first of

578
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:03,472
all, let me answer the question. No, we do not have that in the human

579
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:07,504
Resources department. There have been some instances that we actually

580
00:37:07,622 --> 00:37:11,100
have had looked at with legal

581
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,028
because of some incentives that are out that

582
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:18,820
you are asked that, hey, if you take this incentive,

583
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,868
we expect. You to do this, but that is just under some of

584
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,904
the incentive plans. Not a regular hire.

585
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,170
No. Is it allowable, though,

586
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,224
in your conversations with Legal through the years? Is that something that

587
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:36,996
is permissible? We have not discussed

588
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:40,408
it under the realm of just regular hires to

589
00:37:40,414 --> 00:37:43,404
the city. So I can't find that out. I'd have to discuss it more with

590
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:47,304
Legal, but as I said, we have used it with respect to incentive

591
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:51,276
plans, which are a little different because the incentive is a little bit more

592
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:54,876
than just coming on board. Thank you. Yes, sir. So I've

593
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:59,008
dealt with that on both sides. If you pay an incentive up front

594
00:37:59,174 --> 00:38:03,120
and someone agrees to sign a non compete

595
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,156
and they leave to go to a competitor or whatever it is, then you have

596
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:10,324
the right to go back. But as the State of Texas is a strong right

597
00:38:10,362 --> 00:38:13,840
to work place, good luck,

598
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,380
because it's not going to be enforceable.

599
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,316
Vice Mayor for Tim if you just indulge me. I think it's

600
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:25,112
very important that we

601
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:28,476
understand that retention is going to be something that's a

602
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:31,884
factor here in the city. Okay. And we

603
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:36,456
have employees that are here, and as we are hiring,

604
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:40,512
we have to keep the employees that are here in the city.

605
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:44,416
We have to make them feel like

606
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:48,080
they are wanted so that they no longer want to leave

607
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,888
the city. I think it's very important to us

608
00:38:52,054 --> 00:38:55,732
as a city that we invest, and we are doing that

609
00:38:55,786 --> 00:38:59,540
within the Human Resources Department in training for

610
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,670
our managers and supervisors. It's very important because

611
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,640
in the statistical data that I have looked at, a lot of people

612
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,144
don't leave because of money. They leave because of

613
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,480
their supervisors and managers. And it's very important that

614
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,000
we make an investment in training. I have a new

615
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,844
Chief Financial I'm sorry, a new Chief Learning Officer that's here that

616
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:26,412
has set up a very robust program. And we are just looking

617
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:30,148
forward to training our managers and supervisors

618
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:33,584
to help with understanding and

619
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:37,580
being more empathetic as their managers and supervisors,

620
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,744
making sure that they understand how to deal with the employees so

621
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:45,124
we don't have that revolving door. Yes,

622
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:48,832
sir. Council Member Pollard on the incentive

623
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:52,790
part. So, the City of Houston, we have so many

624
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,596
attractions, events, all types

625
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:02,616
of things that come to our city that we as

626
00:40:02,638 --> 00:40:06,452
a city are a part of, and we could probably package

627
00:40:06,516 --> 00:40:10,504
together as some type of incentive for employees,

628
00:40:10,552 --> 00:40:14,268
whether it's going to certain different

629
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:17,944
attractions, events, sporting games, concerts,

630
00:40:17,992 --> 00:40:21,904
whatever. Right. The city of Houston, I think, should leverage our

631
00:40:22,022 --> 00:40:25,120
partnership with a lot of these different entities,

632
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,516
whether it's Houston first, whether it's the different sporting

633
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:33,120
venues or whatever, so that we can find as many

634
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,572
perks to work for. The city of Houston.

635
00:40:36,716 --> 00:40:40,550
That as a company, we're able to offer you

636
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,652
packages to where you may be eligible for this, that, and or third,

637
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:49,408
for you, your family, or whoever. Right. Just like if you're

638
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:52,344
in the private sector, they're going to try to think of as many perks as

639
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:56,136
possible to lure you into wanting to work for them. But we,

640
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:59,916
as a City of Houston, we have partnerships with everybody, right?

641
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:04,190
And even as council members, we always get all types of

642
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,916
invitations and all types of different ways in

643
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:11,512
which we can engage and partake in the things that Houston

644
00:41:11,576 --> 00:41:15,296
has to offer. It would be great to leverage our ability as

645
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:18,930
a city with all the different entities across the board,

646
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,908
to be able to have packages in place through HR,

647
00:41:23,004 --> 00:41:26,116
to where people who work for the city are eligible to

648
00:41:26,138 --> 00:41:29,460
be able to go to some of these things as well, to make

649
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,528
their jobs and their duties more attractive.

650
00:41:32,704 --> 00:41:36,384
Council Member Pollock, you are exactly correct, and the HR

651
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:39,912
department has already started that we already have

652
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:44,024
online. And maybe we need to make sure it's bigger so that our employees see

653
00:41:44,062 --> 00:41:47,992
it. We already have a lot of partnerships with the Rockets,

654
00:41:48,056 --> 00:41:51,676
the Texans for Discounts. And we actually have

655
00:41:51,778 --> 00:41:55,324
on our website a City of Houston's discount page

656
00:41:55,442 --> 00:41:59,096
that shows employees of the City of Houston

657
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:02,384
about those perks. Now, do we need to do more?

658
00:42:02,502 --> 00:42:06,412
We are trying to do more right now, and we are leveraging

659
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:09,968
everything that comes to us with reference to giving

660
00:42:10,054 --> 00:42:13,472
our employees discounts from taking the kids to the different

661
00:42:13,526 --> 00:42:17,492
circuses and those type things. So we'll just make it bigger on our web page.

662
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:20,390
But we are that's great to hear. All right, thank you. We are.

663
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,992
Okay, we have four public

664
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:27,720
speakers. The first we'll go to is Mr. Doug Smith.

665
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,160
Doug,

666
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,450
star six.

667
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,460
Come on, Doug. You know the gig.

668
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,164
Okay. Jason Oliver. Jason, just come to this mic

669
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:47,070
right here, sir. Thank you.

670
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,856
I just want to say thank you and congratulations on the

671
00:42:56,898 --> 00:43:00,396
on the paid leave. That's really exciting. And I know it's

672
00:43:00,428 --> 00:43:04,084
something that I've been hearing is really good for the city.

673
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,556
First, something the Finance Department kind

674
00:43:07,578 --> 00:43:10,644
of pushed us toward you all was

675
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:14,100
a question about a comparative analysis of employee pay.

676
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,896
Has HR done such a comparative analysis on

677
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:21,496
employee pay across city departments? If so, where can we

678
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:23,560
find it and what needs have you identified?

679
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,072
And then I have one other question that comes from page

680
00:43:28,126 --> 00:43:31,532
seven. How was that one and a half million for higher

681
00:43:31,586 --> 00:43:35,704
Houston youth decided? And then what outcomes can we anticipate

682
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:39,704
from significantly increasing that funding? I care a lot about youth programming.

683
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:43,580
That's really important to me. And so trying to think about how we can expand

684
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,464
higher Houston youth and really kind of build on that,

685
00:43:46,502 --> 00:43:50,448
because that 1.5 million has been static for a

686
00:43:50,454 --> 00:43:53,956
couple of years now, at least. So let

687
00:43:53,978 --> 00:43:57,824
me start with your first question, which I believe was in reference

688
00:43:57,872 --> 00:44:01,392
to the comparative the comparative pay analysis.

689
00:44:01,456 --> 00:44:04,550
So per the financial policy yes,

690
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,324
we just completed that analysis.

691
00:44:08,452 --> 00:44:11,864
So we will be doing a presentation to

692
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:15,544
this council in the next two months. So we

693
00:44:15,582 --> 00:44:19,448
did it on fire, police and municipal employees.

694
00:44:19,544 --> 00:44:22,892
That has been completed. And now we will

695
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:26,460
do a presentation as per the financial policy

696
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,164
to council, and that will be made available.

697
00:44:29,362 --> 00:44:33,004
Okay. All right, with reference to higher Houston

698
00:44:33,052 --> 00:44:36,576
youth, and I believe it was council member was it

699
00:44:36,598 --> 00:44:40,000
council member Green that actually started the

700
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,396
1.5 million for talking about the

701
00:44:43,418 --> 00:44:46,804
higher Houston youth. And so that has been something that has

702
00:44:46,842 --> 00:44:50,452
been in the budget for a long time.

703
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:54,832
The administration would have to raise that 1.5

704
00:44:54,906 --> 00:44:58,952
million. We accepted what was given to us. Of course,

705
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:02,344
we would be glad to do more with more,

706
00:45:02,462 --> 00:45:05,784
but that has just been what has

707
00:45:05,822 --> 00:45:09,630
been allotted for the youth, for the city

708
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,464
since the institution of higher Houston youth.

709
00:45:13,592 --> 00:45:16,860
And what outcomes could we expect from increasing that funding?

710
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,684
Well, right now we have been able, by bringing higher

711
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:23,984
Houston youth into the city's budget, we have been

712
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:27,644
able to increase the number of people of youth

713
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:31,376
that could come in and work here at the city. So when we

714
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:34,580
started, we were right at like a little over 400.

715
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,244
Now we're actually able, because it's in house, to bring

716
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:41,892
in 500 and therefore also bring

717
00:45:41,946 --> 00:45:46,088
in the coaches. We have nine coaches. We believe it's important

718
00:45:46,254 --> 00:45:49,748
that the youth are actually taught

719
00:45:49,924 --> 00:45:52,904
how to, when they go out there, what they have to do.

720
00:45:53,022 --> 00:45:56,744
So we go one step further by actually

721
00:45:56,862 --> 00:46:00,584
having them coming to class, actually showing them what's

722
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:04,616
expected of them. So that can only be bigger

723
00:46:04,808 --> 00:46:07,868
as our funding increases. Because the most important

724
00:46:07,954 --> 00:46:11,760
thing is that children and youth learn by example.

725
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,328
So we have to be able to teach them to reach them.

726
00:46:15,414 --> 00:46:19,040
Okay. Okay. Sarah Blanding,

727
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,210
1 minute, please.

728
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:28,436
1 second. I'd love to see how you okay,

729
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:31,604
I have a couple of questions. You've kind of answered them some way, but I

730
00:46:31,642 --> 00:46:34,710
just want to open the floor to fill in.

731
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,210
What are the city's greatest staffing needs as you see them?

732
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,472
Oh, no, it wasn't okay. What are the city's greatest staffing needs

733
00:46:44,526 --> 00:46:48,632
as you see them? And what would you need not just working within

734
00:46:48,686 --> 00:46:52,216
your current limitations, but let's talk about an ideal

735
00:46:52,248 --> 00:46:55,608
world to increase staffing and retention to fully

736
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:59,116
meet the needs of the city of Houston. And then along with that

737
00:46:59,138 --> 00:47:02,476
is our temporary employee expenditures are much higher than in

738
00:47:02,498 --> 00:47:06,108
previous years. I know to some extent you've

739
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:09,536
probably already answered that. Why do you think that is? And how can we

740
00:47:09,558 --> 00:47:13,216
increase retention among city employees? And I'd love to hear the answer. Not just like

741
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:16,800
working with the loaves and fishes you have, but if somebody performed a miracle

742
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,540
and you actually had what you needed to feed the crowd.

743
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,230
Okay, let me say that

744
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,416
any entity, city government, you are always

745
00:47:29,518 --> 00:47:33,448
going to need more funding at

746
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:36,728
the end of the day, the city's budget is what we have.

747
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:39,868
And like you say, if we were given more money,

748
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:43,708
I'm sure we'd have more people. But we have services

749
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:47,484
that we have to provide to our residents. And what we have

750
00:47:47,522 --> 00:47:51,072
done is to ensure that we are providing that

751
00:47:51,126 --> 00:47:54,924
level of services to our residents, even with the staffing

752
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,608
levels that we have. Our city employees work hard.

753
00:47:58,774 --> 00:48:02,464
They work smart too. And so it's very important,

754
00:48:02,662 --> 00:48:07,316
if I got more money, the departments I

755
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:10,740
hire for the whole city, but at the end of the day,

756
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,212
those departments would have to specify the specific

757
00:48:14,346 --> 00:48:18,264
needs. I'm the person that has to get the people in

758
00:48:18,302 --> 00:48:22,708
there. I don't want to I don't want to speak for police

759
00:48:22,724 --> 00:48:26,036
and fire. I can't, because the chiefs

760
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:30,044
know what they need in their departments. But I'm sure if any

761
00:48:30,082 --> 00:48:33,032
department was the funding was increased,

762
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,030
that would assist them in getting more people.

763
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,560
Again, our city employees are stretched. I say

764
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,650
every day,

765
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,208
they sacrifice what they make, they sacrifice the hours

766
00:48:48,294 --> 00:48:51,760
that they have to be on duty, but they still

767
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:55,936
provide the level of servants to our residents. So wish

768
00:48:55,968 --> 00:48:59,156
we could have more money, but until then, we're going to keep providing what we

769
00:48:59,178 --> 00:49:02,608
need to provide. Thank you. Mr Bernard

770
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:03,460
Butler,

771
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,190
last public speaker. Thanks.

772
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,770
He'll ask five questions in a minute, though, right?

773
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,500
Thank you, Madam Director.

774
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,472
Thank you in your department, but apologies,

775
00:49:24,536 --> 00:49:28,110
ladies, I'm going to speak through you.

776
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,232
Let's call a thing a thing. I concluded that all

777
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:37,520
city departments have been understaffed.

778
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,852
It's no longer about prioritization when

779
00:49:42,906 --> 00:49:46,612
you receive less services. Every citizen should ask when they

780
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:50,212
call. Thank you. Every citizen should ask when they

781
00:49:50,266 --> 00:49:53,396
call a department, are you

782
00:49:53,418 --> 00:49:57,400
fully staffed? Because this is how communities like mine

783
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,700
become underserved for so long. It's not about great resignations,

784
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,332
it's not about tightening budgets, it's not even about COVID

785
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:09,832
These things just exposed a situation that existed.

786
00:50:09,976 --> 00:50:13,692
And I will say, at the end of the day, we're citizens too.

787
00:50:13,826 --> 00:50:17,308
But when it comes to where everything

788
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:21,212
shows up, by the time we get there too many

789
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:24,270
priorities, but we're already way behind.

790
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,350
Thank you. Thank you.

791
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,780
And directors, thank you very much for your time and your presentation.

792
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,610
Thank you. Thank you.
