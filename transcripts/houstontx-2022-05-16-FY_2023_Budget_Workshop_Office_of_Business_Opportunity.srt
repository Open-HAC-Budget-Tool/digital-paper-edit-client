1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,026
At this time, I'd like to welcome Director Marsha Murray

2
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:11,854
and Pat C. Jackson to give us the presentation on

3
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:15,550
Office of Business Opportunity budget. Presentation.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,118
Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Is my mic on?

5
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:22,366
Yes, ma'am. Okay. Good afternoon, mayor Pro TEM,

6
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:26,018
Vice Chair and Council members, I'm pleased to present OBO's

7
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:29,666
proposed fiscal year 23 budget today. I'm joined

8
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:33,474
today by OBO's Chief Financial Officer Patsy Jackson.

9
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:37,586
I'd also like to recognize some of the OBO team members that are here today.

10
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,390
Lala Morris Obio's assistant director,

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,322
as well as Pearl Cahalas, our council liaison and

12
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:48,954
Pio. In his absence, I'd also like to acknowledge Tim

13
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:52,682
Warren, who's our Certification and Designation Division Manager,

14
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:56,346
and two supervisors who are overseeing our Contract Compliance

15
00:00:56,378 --> 00:01:00,154
Division at this point, Shanita Petway, as well as Jamante Huey.

16
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:03,546
I thank you all for your fabulous work, your tremendous work in

17
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:07,170
moving the core services of the Office of Business Opportunity forward.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,186
Next slide, please. At the Office of

19
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,446
Business Opportunity, we execute our mission of cultivating a competitive

20
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,518
and diverse economic environment and the City of Houston by promoting the success

21
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:22,198
of small businesses and developing Houston's workforce, with a

22
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:26,242
special emphasis on historically underutilized businesses and disenfranchised

23
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:29,386
individuals through the provision of several core services.

24
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:33,334
Next slide, please. This slide

25
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:37,526
represents our organizational chart. Fund 1000 covers OBO's

26
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:40,306
core services, including executive Oversight,

27
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,046
Certification, contract compliance, and External affairs and

28
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:48,298
workforce development. Accounting for our $5.4 million budget

29
00:01:48,394 --> 00:01:51,386
and approximately 43 FTEs.

30
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,402
The Executive Leadership team includes myself,

31
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:58,206
the Assistant Director, our Chief Financial Officer, the Citywide

32
00:01:58,238 --> 00:02:02,014
Title VI Compliance Coordinator and our one person analytics

33
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:05,434
and reporting team. Our Certification and Designation

34
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:08,742
Division administers six local certifications and two

35
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,914
federal certifications on behalf of the US. Department of Transportation.

36
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:16,914
Those certifications are listed here. In addition, we facilitate

37
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:20,266
historically underutilized business certification on behalf of

38
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,106
the State of Texas, and our newest certification added to

39
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,182
our directory is the Lgbtbe certification. The Division

40
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:31,982
also processes applications for the city's local preference program. The Higher

41
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:35,562
Houston First program, the Contract Compliance Division,

42
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:39,866
monitors all city contracts with the exception of housing and airport contracts,

43
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:43,778
to ensure compliance with the minority Women's Small Business Enterprise program

44
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:47,326
requirements and to enforce local and federal labor

45
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:51,186
standards, including prevailing wage compliance and prompt payment requirements on

46
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,890
city contracts. Our External Affairs team raises

47
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,930
awareness of OBO services and the city's contracting opportunities

48
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,274
and also provides local businesses with access to business development

49
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:06,006
resources. This team also administers business development and

50
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:09,802
capacity building programs. And finally, our Workforce Development team

51
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,690
facilitates initiatives such as the Turnaround Houston job in a Readiness Fair.

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,414
Next slide, please. So this slide

53
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:21,466
represents our Special Fund, Fund 24 24, which covers

54
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:24,654
the Contractor Responsibility Fund, which supports the

55
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:28,718
administrative and programmatic operations of the city's. Payer Play Program

56
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:32,938
The Payer Play Program aims to level the playing field for contracts

57
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:36,738
between bidders that choose to offer health benefits to

58
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:40,002
their workforce and those who do not. The program also

59
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:43,378
offsets the cost of providing health care to uninsured people in

60
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:47,042
the Houston Harris County area. The Contractor Responsibility

61
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,486
Fund supports three city programs and those programs are listed on

62
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:52,360
this slide. Next slide, please.

63
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,186
So, in the interest of time, I will ask you to review at

64
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,514
your election slides five and six, which provides more details about

65
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:05,500
our core services. I'll skip over to slide seven.

66
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,574
So, while we do have some flexibility in terms

67
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:20,410
of delivering OBS core services, there are statutory requirements

68
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,046
for components of our services at the local, state and federal

69
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:27,890
levels. Federal funding is tied to our Title Six

70
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,186
certification and contract compliance work. As it

71
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,866
relates to certification, federal regulations require that all recipients of

72
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:39,286
Department of Transportation funding in excess of $250,000

73
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:43,634
in a federal fiscal year are required to have a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise

74
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:47,646
program to ensure nondiscrimination in the award and administration

75
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:52,022
of Department of Transportation assisted contracts. Failure to properly

76
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:55,706
administer the aforementioned programs can result in a loss of

77
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,300
Federal funding. Next slide, please.

78
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,042
So, this slide we are describing the financial and societal impact

79
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,626
of our service deliveries. The services that OBO administers

80
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:12,922
have broad societal impact for not only small business owners,

81
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:16,974
but also their employees. Obio's contract compliance team advocates

82
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:20,286
for and enforces the rights of certified firms on contracts

83
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:24,462
with goals, and ensures that employees of City of Houston construction

84
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:28,438
contractors are paid appropriate wages, ultimately supporting the

85
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:31,810
local economy and improving the lives of Houstonians.

86
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,606
Revenues collected from the Paraplay program offset the cost of

87
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:38,598
providing health care to uninsured Houstonians.

88
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:41,946
The City's Title Six program ensures equal access to

89
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:45,350
city facilities and program in by all Houstonians.

90
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,494
And our certification program serves to expand opportunities for firms

91
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:53,806
as they can be utilized on City of Houston projects and on projects with other

92
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:58,814
area agencies and private companies. Some of those companies or

93
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:01,946
entities are listed at the bottom of this slide. Next slide,

94
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:05,474
please. And this

95
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:09,314
slide discusses the anticipated growth in number of customers

96
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:13,422
that we expect in fiscal year 23. We expect an increased

97
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:16,966
demand for MWSBE certification due to new

98
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:20,978
MWBE programs in the region, such as the Harris County

99
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:25,270
and Poor Houston race and gender conscious programs. We also expect

100
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,450
demands from businesses seeking to participate in the Houston based

101
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,354
NCWA Final Four Supplier Diversity Initiative next

102
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,710
year. And we also anticipate that there will be additional

103
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,298
opportunities for firms brought

104
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:42,350
on by infrastructure projects.

105
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,798
HPW has also predicted that there will

106
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:52,350
be an increase in the number of contracts that

107
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,950
are let. As a result, we anticipate an increase in our overall

108
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,842
contract compliance monitoring workload. And finally,

109
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:03,934
the Northeast Water Purification Plant Project has approximately

110
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:07,862
931 project 930

111
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:11,170
subcontractors participating and growing.

112
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,882
This project will increase our MWSBE contract

113
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:19,206
compliance monitoring and prevailing wage and labor standards monitoring.

114
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:23,126
Next slide, please. So at this time, I will ask Ms.

115
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:26,394
Jackson to discuss the projected revenues and expenditures in our

116
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:29,674
proposed FY 23 budget on

117
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:33,374
our revenue by funds. The General Fund revenue indicated on the first

118
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,182
row of this slide increased by 74% and

119
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:40,958
FY 23 over FY 22. The special revenue on

120
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:44,778
the second row increased by 7.94%, and FY 23

121
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:48,546
over FY 22. Let's go to the next slide and give a little

122
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:53,006
bit more information about that. These are our revenue highlights.

123
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:56,374
The FY 23 General Fund proposed budget increased by

124
00:07:56,492 --> 00:08:00,486
74% is due to the three additional FTEs transferring from

125
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:04,994
the Houston Public Works Department. This revenue consists of HPW's

126
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:08,906
contributions to support our contract compliance staff, which currently

127
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:12,822
funds nine positions. The General Fund revenue

128
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:16,726
supports the City's Payer Play program, the FY 23 budget

129
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:20,998
increased by 7.94% and it is attributed

130
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:25,006
to anticipated increases to the revenue that supports Fund 24 24.

131
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:29,130
Of note, though, Houston Public Works estimate a 6% increase

132
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,682
in revenue due to an increase of vendors participating in the

133
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:36,210
pay portion of the pay or play program working on the new

134
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,934
project. Houston Airport System anticipate

135
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:43,966
projects moving from design to construction phase, and more contracts

136
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:47,442
awarded using the pay option will result in increased

137
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:51,362
revenue, and the Housing and Community Development Department anticipates

138
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:55,030
more contracts in FY 23 which will increase revenue by 15%

139
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,800
to 20%. Next slide, please.

140
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,606
Expenditure by Fund Obio's FY 22 General Fund estimate

141
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:07,834
budget for Fund 1000 is 4.1 million. The 5.4

142
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:11,718
million proposed budget for FY 23 reflected on this slide shows a

143
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:15,130
32.58% increase due to two additional

144
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,510
position in OBO Solutions Center, which will manage new business

145
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,840
programs and increase the visibility of the Department services.

146
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,626
Three employees transfer from HPW to the Contract Compliance Division to

147
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:30,222
assist in managing the HPW contracts, two additional

148
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:34,142
positions for the certification division and a onetime funding for vendor

149
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,414
augmented contract monitoring to ensure compliance with

150
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:41,202
statutory requirements. The special revenue

151
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:45,634
expenditure line item reflects expenditures for administrative and pragmatic

152
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:50,730
operations of the City's payer play program. This fund shows a 31.30%

153
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,806
decrease because the one time funding in FY 22 for ethan Houston

154
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:58,870
Fire Department personnel is not included in FY 23 budget.

155
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,334
In FY 23, this fund supports funding for health

156
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:06,394
benefits, pension contribution and municipal employees contractual

157
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:10,350
pay increases funded to maintain an electronic management system

158
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,594
to effectively track all pay or play activities. The FY 23

159
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:18,174
budget continues to support the contractor responsibility funds

160
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:21,220
initiatives such as the Client Access Program,

161
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,258
crisis called Diversion Program, and the Emergency Telehealth

162
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:28,520
and Navigation Ethan program. Next slide, please.

163
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,478
Why FY 23 personnel versus nonpersonal for Fund 1000

164
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:36,774
OBO's proposed budget of 5.4 million,

165
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,814
82% of that covers personnel expenses,

166
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:44,122
salaries and French benefits. Of the remaining 18%

167
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:48,694
of our budget, 4% covers restricted charge accounts

168
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:52,302
that are charged backs by the City of Houston, 1% covers the cost

169
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:55,914
of the B City Certification and Contract Compliance

170
00:10:55,962 --> 00:11:00,314
Management system, and 13% covers other services including

171
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:04,542
the contract monitoring program, the printing and reproduction,

172
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:08,094
professional development and training for our employees. Next slide

00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:11,714
please. Slide 14, which is the FY 23

174
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:15,074
personnel versus nonpersonal for fund 24. 24 covers the

175
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:18,566
Contractor Responsibility Fund, which supports the operations of the City

176
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:22,006
of Houston payroll play program. 15% of that budget will

177
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:25,894
fund personnel expenses such as salaries, fringe benefits for

178
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:30,086
the administrative responsible for the financial and program oversight.

179
00:11:30,198 --> 00:11:33,494
The other 85% of the budget will fund the three listed

180
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:36,940
program and technology costs. Next slide, please.

181
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,046
Slide 15 is our FY 23 budget expenditure net

182
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,646
Change. This slide is a visual representation of the

183
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:49,706
net change and general fund budget that we discussed

184
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:52,000
earlier. Go to the next slide, please.

185
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,946
Slide 16 and 17. They both details what

186
00:11:56,968 --> 00:12:00,242
we discussed early in our presentation. And that

187
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:03,666
concludes our financial portion of OBO's budget, and I will

188
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:07,254
refer that back to our director. Thank you. And thank you. And that

189
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:11,154
concludes our presentation. Before I take questions, I'd like to briefly highlight

190
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:14,642
the appendix that follows, which you can review at your election.

191
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:18,078
The appendix provides additional information, including Oba's

192
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:21,702
organizational chart, a breakdown of staff demographics,

193
00:12:21,846 --> 00:12:25,418
Obia's FY two accomplishments which we're very proud of,

194
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:28,300
and some of our unmet needs. Thank you,

195
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,858
Council Member Ed Pollan. Thank you,

196
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:36,398
Chair, and thank you, Director, for your presentation and to your

197
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:40,286
entire staff for all the great work that you all do. I know you

198
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:44,190
make the most with a little, and it's appreciated and valued.

199
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,982
A couple of questions. We had a Disparity

200
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:51,586
study done, correct? We did. How much was that

201
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:55,300
Disparity study? Why are we not using that Disparity study?

202
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,720
And in the Disparity study, is it breaking down

203
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,990
opportunities based on specific race?

204
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,050
Okay, so we did commission a Disparity study that

205
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,466
will not be published. I'm sorry. Is it are

206
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:17,340
we good? Okay, so the city did commission a Disparity study,

207
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,546
and because there are concerns about

208
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:25,374
the methodology that was used to perform the Disparity study, the city

209
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:29,198
will not be publishing that study. So I cannot speak

210
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:33,006
about any of the substantive how long was that Disparity study covering?

211
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:36,258
What years did it cover? So it's covered twelve through

212
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:38,578
16 fiscal years,

213
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:42,482
1230 fiscal years.

214
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:46,219
Twelve through 16. And how much money did we spend on that? It cost a

215
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:50,070
little bit under a million dollars. And we're not publishing it at all?

216
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,766
No. And so now, to my

217
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:57,486
understanding, we are looking to do another Disparity study. So there's

218
00:13:57,538 --> 00:14:00,938
currently an RFP that is on

219
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:04,634
the street soliciting proposals for a new

220
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:07,820
Disparity study covering fiscal years

221
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,622
through fiscal year 17, through fiscal year 21,

222
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:16,126
a five year period, and who makes a determination on whether the

223
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:19,550
methodology was something that we believe

224
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,262
is useful or not. So the determination

225
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:27,154
is really based on the

226
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:30,450
experience with administering programs like this,

227
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,466
particularly the kind of program that

228
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:38,642
we have. Without going into substantive

229
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:42,680
details about what's contained within that draft study.

230
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,674
It really did not. I believe in the memo that I wrote to the mayor

231
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:50,214
that was shared with council members. I believe

232
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:54,522
I included in that memo that it really did not reflect the way

233
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:57,900
in which the City of Houston administers its program.

234
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,640
You put me back in the queue. Thank you.

235
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,466
Vice Mayor Pro TEM martha Castex Tatum. Thank you, Director Murray.

236
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:08,862
Thank you for your presentation. I'm curious to know,

237
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:12,666
last budget cycle, we put forth a budget amendment

238
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:17,250
for some additional dollars to get caught up on our contract compliance.

239
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,082
Where are we in that process, and have we made any progress with

240
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:25,714
getting caught up on our contract compliance? So I am

241
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:29,094
happy to report that the mayor has, as part of the fiscal year

242
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:32,694
22s budget, he's actually provided additional funding for

243
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:36,722
us to actually augment and our our existing contract

244
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:40,454
compliance monitoring services through the engagement of vendors. So additional

245
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:44,294
information will be provided shortly about that engagement,

246
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:48,678
because as is the case with other departments,

247
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:52,814
we're certainly not immune to the

248
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:56,094
great resignation. And so we have lost a

249
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:59,470
substantial number of our compliance officers,

250
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,154
which is why there has been this urgency to

251
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:05,234
actually augment our existing services.

252
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:09,198
Unfortunately, we've only been able to, and we're

253
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:12,866
just having issues attracting compliance officers. So we

254
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,594
had seven compliance offers. We're now up

255
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:20,178
to two compliance officers. So really, the rest of the remaining

256
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:23,926
of the staff is really all hands on deck in terms of trying to

257
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:27,382
address the workload that currently exists. What's the pay

258
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:31,306
for a compliance officer? So, for a

259
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:35,718
compliance officer, it's approximately 48,000. For a senior compliance officer,

260
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:37,980
it's approximately 56,000,

261
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,102
and the qualifications for it. And so the

262
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:48,094
compliance officer requires a bachelor's degree and

263
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,486
one year experience, or years of experience can

264
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:55,214
be substituted year for year for the bachelor's degree. For a senior compliance

265
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:58,914
officer, the difference is two years experience. Okay.

266
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:03,026
Thank you, Council Member Ed Pollard. Thank you,

267
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:08,018
Chair. Sometimes when we have contracts

268
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:11,938
that come out, we're looking for MWBEs to participate,

269
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:15,846
but we get word that there aren't any in

270
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,142
the directory or there's a void for minority vendors

271
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:23,258
in that particular industry space. Do we keep a log of

272
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:26,886
where we may have voids and try to find ways to identify

273
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:30,220
minority companies within the city that

274
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,170
if we were to reach out to them, could participate

275
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,506
in certain contracts? So we're not necessarily keeping

276
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:42,240
a log, but we are aware of some of the areas where

277
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,522
there are gaps. So when our

278
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:51,202
external affairs team actually goes on to the community, they may actually

279
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:55,300
emphasize the fact that there are opportunities in a particular area

280
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,834
and encourage for firms

281
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:02,214
to get certified. And we are generally just looking to

282
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:05,570
increase the number of firms and the variety,

283
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,854
the diversity in terms of industry, the diversity of firms

284
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:12,282
that are actually certified. And when it comes

285
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:14,460
to the openings that you have,

286
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,258
so those are current openings that people can go online right now

287
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:23,166
and apply for those positions. Yeah. Any opening that

288
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:27,034
we have that has not been closed because we've

289
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:30,366
exhausted the period for which the posting is out absolutely are

290
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:34,094
available on the City's website. We do, actually, because we recognize

291
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:37,746
the challenges in

292
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:41,006
reaching out to people. So we have social media. My external affairs

293
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,274
team has created social media campaigns. We have

294
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:48,854
leveraged our advisory board members to actually reach

295
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:52,822
out to their network of folks to

296
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:56,934
talk about our various positions. We are perpetually talking ad

297
00:18:56,972 --> 00:19:00,154
nauseam about these positions. And we've also

298
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:04,134
been just internally talking about reevaluating some of the postings

299
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:07,770
that we put out there. We certainly want to be clear about

300
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,114
what the responsibilities of the position, but we also want to talk

301
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:14,682
about the benefits, lead with the benefits of working

302
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,790
for the city, lead with the benefits of the impact. That the kind of work

303
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,390
that you can do as a compliance officer can have on the lives of people.

304
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,580
But I think you all do a tremendous job of putting out information.

305
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,834
I'm always getting updates. I think we as a council should

306
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:32,660
collaborate more on making sure our constituents have that information.

307
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,730
So whatever information you do have on current openings,

308
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,680
please send to my office. Sure. Thank you.

309
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,186
So just a quick follow up on Council Member Pollard's initial

310
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:49,126
line of questions on the Disparity study. So we issued

311
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:52,934
an RFP. We got it. We received the answers,

312
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:56,586
we paid them a million dollars. We received the

313
00:19:56,608 --> 00:20:01,066
information, but we're doing nothing with it at

314
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:04,526
this point. It's not going to be published. We haven't paid the full amount of

315
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:07,998
the contract. What have we paid of the million dollars? I'm sorry?

316
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:11,710
What have we paid of the million whatever it was? Probably 900

317
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,062
and change. So we had $900,000 we paid for Disparity

318
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:19,090
study, and correct me if I'm wrong.

319
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,786
We define the scope because we issued the

320
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:26,754
RFP. So in an RFP, you define the scope of your project.

321
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:30,246
And if you define the scope of your project as to,

322
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:33,542
here are the particular questions. Here's the information

323
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:37,174
we want to look at. And they give us that. And it

324
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:40,570
has nothing to do with how we define the process,

325
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,410
then we shouldn't pay them a penny. If they did follow

326
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,202
it and gave us information that the data probably came

327
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:51,546
back and we didn't like it, then we should pay them and we

328
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:54,830
should release the data. And let us judge as to

329
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,574
was it effective or not, because I point back and

330
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:01,754
I say we had a process that we followed.

331
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:06,050
We didn't identify the scope. If they gave us the incorrect answers,

332
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,354
if we did identify the scope of the RFP and

333
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:13,202
they answered it based upon our scope check,

334
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:15,730
if they didn't, they shouldn't get a penny.

335
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,746
So while I can't delve into the substantive details

336
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,806
of this, this is really a legal matter at this point. I do want to

337
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:26,630
say that it's not a matter of not liking the final results.

338
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,554
And certainly we do define the scope. What we don't dictate is

339
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:34,490
methodology. That actually has to be something

340
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:40,414
that's independently decided by

341
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:44,126
the consultant. It's a little bit more nuanced and

342
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:48,314
then taken into account the existing programs that actually exist

343
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:52,142
for us. But I'm most

344
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:56,798
comfortable deferring questions about the disparity study to our legal department.

345
00:21:56,974 --> 00:22:00,226
Fine. I understand.

346
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:03,826
Pay for play. There's another component that

347
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:07,766
we include into the bid process that awards points,

348
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:11,474
and I forgot what it's called to companies that are headquartered

349
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:14,680
here in the city. Hire Houston first. Hire Houston first.

350
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,886
So Ed Pollard answers the RFP and Dave Martin

351
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:21,606
answers the RFP. Ed Pollard.

352
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:26,614
Pollard. I'm assuming the objective of that is to get taxpaying

353
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:30,154
dollars. More of an opportunity to participate in our

354
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:34,142
business. Ed Pollard lives in the city. He works

355
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:37,802
for his company here that's based here. He has five employees.

356
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:42,122
Dave Martin lives in the City and Dave Martin has 600 employees

357
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:45,602
that live in the city of Houston. But yet he gets ten

358
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:49,662
points on a bid and I get zero. So if the objective

359
00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:53,794
is to give opportunities to people, taxpayers, then why

360
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:57,102
do you look at that information and give him the points?

361
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:01,382
I've always had a big problem in our RFP process with this

362
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:05,158
because we have a number of companies that are great companies

363
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:08,970
in the city that employ a lot of people that

364
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,954
they lose bids on those ten points, but yet they have an

365
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:17,210
enormous employee force that lives in the city,

366
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,854
that are taxpayers and derive a lot of benefit.

367
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,366
But we give it to the small company who has a third

368
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:28,554
of those employees. I know it was passed by council

369
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:32,202
years ago, but why can't we look at that? Because that fundamentally

370
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:36,290
seems very unfair to me. So I do want to say that hire Houston first.

371
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,740
The designation which my office administers is not based on size.

372
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,206
Really? The criteria is that headquarters?

373
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:47,710
I'm sorry? Headquarters. That's what it's based on, correct? It's what isn't it

374
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,174
based on? Headquarters. Sorry to interrupt. It's actually based on principal place

375
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:54,822
of business. We have headquarters as an option, or 20%

376
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:58,234
of their workforce is actually locally based, but it's not a

377
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:01,898
size driven designation. So the City has

378
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:06,042
made a determination that for those companies that have actually

379
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:09,802
gone through the designation process and are declared as a local

380
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:14,426
business or a city business, that if they're competitive,

381
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:18,526
there's a leg up in the bidding process. So do

382
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:22,078
you think that was it? Higher Houston First

383
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:25,506
is a fair and equitable program

384
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:28,706
within the confines of what we do, it is.

385
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:32,498
But what we have found, I will say that our local companies

386
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:36,006
are actually very competitive. So our analysis on an

387
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:39,542
annual basis, we do publish a Higher Houston First report,

388
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:43,238
which we've been publishing for several years, actually shows that

389
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:47,442
our local companies are securing contracts without

390
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:51,062
the application of the Higher Houston First designation.

391
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:55,100
But it's there as a safety net in the event.

392
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,270
They're not competitive on their own. For the investments,

393
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,726
for the promoting the kind of investments that you described earlier, isn't it a 10%

394
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:07,790
variable? I'm sorry? Isn't it a 10% on an RFP process?

395
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,550
Isn't it a 10% equation?

396
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,494
Depending on the type of bid it is, I think it's like two to 3%

397
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:20,078
as long as you're within two to 3% of the lowest bid.

398
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:24,062
Good. So all my career, I've worked for a big firms

399
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:27,702
that weren't headquartered here. And we competed against really small

400
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:30,918
firms, and we had 600 people and they had five.

401
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:35,110
And I always felt that that was a very unfair deal

402
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,046
to give them the points, because sometimes we

403
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:42,906
may have lost business. I don't know. But I always thought if your

404
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:47,130
really objective is to give the opportunity to taxpayer citizens,

405
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,034
wow. Figure out how many you have that live here, pay taxes

406
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:55,630
here, and then compete against them and let the numbers

407
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,430
tell that story. But I'll get off my soapbox.

408
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,760
I'll be quiet over to Tiffany D.

409
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,100
Council Member Abby Cayman's office.

410
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,346
Good afternoon, Director. Mary. I have just one question on

411
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:15,086
behalf of Council Member Cayman. Due to the financial and budgetary constraints

412
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:18,162
the city continues to face from revenue limitations,

413
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:22,070
are there critical needs that your department are not able to address

414
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,462
at this time? And if there are, what are they? So,

415
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:29,734
as I mentioned earlier, we certainly struggling

416
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:35,638
in the contract compliance realm. And so the mayor is offering us funding,

417
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:38,954
us actually contracting out some of our

418
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:43,760
augmenting our existing contract compliance monitoring services

419
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,754
for a period of time. We have performed

420
00:26:47,802 --> 00:26:51,600
analysis of how many people we do need to

421
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,250
perform contract compliance, effective compliance,

422
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,394
on a long term basis. And the numbers are

423
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:02,290
actually pretty high. And that's actually included in the appendix.

424
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,682
While we currently have seven compliance officers, we are anticipating

425
00:27:07,746 --> 00:27:11,314
that we need about 30 to 37 compliance

426
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:14,310
officers. We have been working with HPW,

427
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,522
and Ms. Jackson actually

428
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:21,834
described some transfers that have been made,

429
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:26,118
personal transfers from the HPW department to facilitate

430
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:29,690
some of our compliance functions. But at this point,

431
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,258
we're not certainly the help that we'll receive via

432
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:36,602
vendors will be great, but long term,

433
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:40,414
we do need to augment our increase our

434
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:41,310
staffing.

435
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,226
Okay, Director Murray and Ms. Jackson, we have four public speakers who

436
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:51,810
are all in person here. And the first one we have is Mr.

437
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,730
Oliver, Jason Oliver.

438
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,944
He's the director of our Mic Communication Today and doing

439
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:04,280
a great job of it. I'll send you my invoice.

440
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,696
So management consulting has increased dramatically. I'm just trying to figure out

441
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:14,696
if that's where the contract compliance is showing up. Is that what's

442
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:18,956
happening there? The management consultant? Is that where we put this? It's about 520?

443
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:22,430
Yes. Okay. That's what I thought. Okay. Just making sure

444
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,344
you had talked about the 48,000 for

445
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:31,116
the contract compliance. How does that compare to peer peer

446
00:28:31,148 --> 00:28:34,496
roles? And then the third

447
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:37,972
question that I want to ask is about the crisis Call

448
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:41,268
diversion funds that were approved and allocated last year. I know

449
00:28:41,274 --> 00:28:44,772
that kind of falls under your purview. Those are

450
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:48,196
just now being put into use. Can you talk about the delay

451
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,530
in implementation there and kind of what factors into that?

452
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,204
Because it seems like the need for those diversionary calls

453
00:28:55,252 --> 00:28:58,164
is significant, particularly during the pandemic.

454
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:02,228
Okay. Patsy, do you want to discuss the crisis call

455
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:06,492
diversion program was already being sponsored through

456
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:09,772
another source. We were just asked to

457
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:13,456
start to fund that source starting in 2021.

458
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,152
So it had already been funded before. It didn't just now start.

459
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:19,810
We just start to become a part of it.

460
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,884
So it's been affected before. Okay, so that

461
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:28,784
ARPA funding that's being used for that has been actualized

462
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:32,388
or it's not actually being used. I'm unclear on

463
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:36,004
what that means. So we're not going

464
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:39,168
to be poised to discuss any kind of ARPA funding as it

465
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,076
relates to that program as this fund focuses on the revenue that's

466
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:46,872
collected via the Pay option of Pay or play. Got you. Okay.

467
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:51,150
And as far as contract compliance, the competitiveness of

468
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,344
our salaries, we have done ad hoc

469
00:29:56,392 --> 00:30:00,124
analyses looking at other

470
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:02,908
compliance officers in the state, particularly Austin.

471
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:07,504
And I know that our assistant director just came back from a

472
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:11,516
conference where she spoke with other practitioners

473
00:30:11,628 --> 00:30:15,664
compliance contract compliance practitioners and certainly discovered

474
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:18,900
that our salaries are not, in fact, competitive.

475
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,470
Surprise, surprise. Thank you. Thank you,

476
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,020
Sarah. Blanding. Blanding.

477
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,936
I'm sorry. Hey, thank you so

478
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,864
much for all you do with so little.

479
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:38,004
And I'm just going to keep talking about these compliance

480
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:41,644
specialists because I've been obsessed with them since you all did your presentation last year.

481
00:30:41,682 --> 00:30:45,484
I couldn't believe how many we needed versus what you all

482
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:49,592
actually had to operate with. And I appreciate

483
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:52,960
that there's been an effort for some sort of stop gap in the meantime,

484
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,432
and I appreciate to know that the

485
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:02,000
salaries are not competitive. Unfortunately, I'm not surprised.

486
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,048
I guess my question is, what do you need in order to expand to

487
00:31:06,054 --> 00:31:09,670
the adequate number of compliance specialists to address our city's needs?

488
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,508
I'm just concerned there has not been a strong effort to address it. And I

489
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:17,476
guess that's honestly a side comment to the City Council, and I'd love to

490
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:21,108
see some budget amendments. So I'm

491
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:24,264
just curious what you all need, like what that dollar amount would be to

492
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:27,764
actually get that 30 to 37 in a competitive

493
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:28,680
salary.

494
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,788
Ideally, we would have all senior Business Development Coordinators, because I

495
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:39,864
would say that the level of work really rises to a senior compliance

496
00:31:39,912 --> 00:31:43,616
level on a daily basis. And I'm

497
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:47,728
not really fantastic at multiplication, so I'd say

498
00:31:47,894 --> 00:31:51,824
$58 to $60,000 times the

499
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:55,090
number of persons that are actually needed,

500
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,204
the 30 to 37. All right,

501
00:31:59,322 --> 00:32:02,484
thank you. Adding to the two that we already

502
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:05,828
have, that's 2.1 million. Just if anyone wants to write that down,

503
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:08,820
got it. Thank you. Council Member Ed Pollard.

504
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,092
Thank you, Chair. The county recently did a Disparity

505
00:32:13,156 --> 00:32:16,244
study, did they not? They did. It was published,

506
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,744
I think, maybe about a little bit over a year, a year and a half

507
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:22,830
ago. Do you know the firm that they used to do their Disparity study?

508
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,564
Do I know the firm? Are you familiar with the firm? I am.

509
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:30,572
Is it the same firm that we used? It is.

510
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:34,732
Okay. And so we use the same

511
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,496
firm as them. They publish theirs. We're not publishing ours. But we

512
00:32:38,518 --> 00:32:41,776
spent almost a million dollars. My issue with

513
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:45,092
it is we keep talking about we have

514
00:32:45,226 --> 00:32:48,516
budget restraints or we don't have the money to

515
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:52,036
pay for employees or whatever the case may be across the

516
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:56,224
board. But then we have a vendor who answered

517
00:32:56,272 --> 00:32:59,496
the solicitation. We paid them almost a million dollars, but we're not

518
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:02,984
going to release the report when the county used

519
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,648
the same vendor for their report,

520
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:10,796
which actually highlighted a lot of the deficiencies that they had in their

521
00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:15,070
program. I don't even think they had a program. Right. So I do think

522
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,004
while, again, I don't want to get into the

523
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:22,492
details of necessarily the issue

524
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:26,384
here, I do think it's important to note that the county did

525
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,628
not have a program. So you're starting with a clean slate.

526
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:33,692
And so the analysis of a nonexisting program and

527
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:37,140
contracting patterns versus a program that's actually been around

528
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,356
since 1984 and the nuances of such a

529
00:33:40,378 --> 00:33:44,372
program is material to

530
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:47,160
how our Disparity studies actually conducted.

531
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,212
Thank you. So, Vice Chair legal's budget presentation

532
00:33:52,276 --> 00:33:55,684
is Thursday at 01:00. And guess who will be sitting in the captain's

533
00:33:55,732 --> 00:33:59,116
chair? You. So ask that question on

534
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:03,580
Thursday. Ms. Joe Groch.

535
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,532
Grochell did? Good the first time,

536
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:10,460
bad the second. My apologies. How are you?

537
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,800
Apology accepted. Thank you, ladies.

538
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,536
So I understand your mission is to convulse to cultivate a

539
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:20,640
competitive and diverse economic environment.

540
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,764
My question to you is, with $1.7

541
00:34:25,882 --> 00:34:29,104
trillion in college debt and many people questioning

542
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:32,692
the value of a college degree, are efforts being made to

543
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:36,144
eliminate college from many job requirements by

544
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:39,556
promoting skills for, quote, unquote, new collar

545
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:43,028
jobs? So we're not specifically engaged

546
00:34:43,044 --> 00:34:47,210
in efforts to eliminate college. Our workforce development team

547
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:52,924
is actually focused on just providing information

548
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:57,016
about different career pathways for Houstonians.

549
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,510
Okay, thank you. Okay. Thank you,

550
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,280
Mr. Butler.

551
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,496
Good afternoon, Director. I want to

552
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:17,744
talk about what could be compared to what you've guys been talking about,

553
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,076
of what is that will sort itself out. But I'm from

554
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:24,304
northeast Houston, and in my opinion, business creation

555
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:27,936
has been lacking for where I reside. So thus

556
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:31,640
it's the number one issue for me and the residents where I live.

557
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:36,120
So I'm curious if there is any possibility

558
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,664
going forward in an evolution not this

559
00:35:40,702 --> 00:35:44,716
budget, next budget, but there are three things that I was wondering if you

560
00:35:44,738 --> 00:35:48,444
could say, I see it in the stars or. No,

561
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,916
we're not structurally able to do it. The first one

562
00:35:51,938 --> 00:35:55,116
is to launch a business incubator or accelerator in

563
00:35:55,138 --> 00:35:58,828
conjunction with the HCC North Forest campus

564
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:02,496
that exists in my community. Also to create an

565
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:05,964
Office of Research and Evaluation charge with studying barriers

566
00:36:06,012 --> 00:36:09,510
to wealth and business development in communities of color.

567
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,912
Lastly, establish an Office of Advocacy

568
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:16,564
and Intergovernmental Affairs to score the

569
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:20,964
effects of proposed legislation and regulations on barriers

570
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,570
to minority owned small business creation and success.

571
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,872
So for the last, establishing the Office

572
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:32,436
of Advocacy, that is definitely not something that I can commit

573
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:35,790
to. But I think for all three, what I can say to you is that

574
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,884
we welcome partnerships to explore these

575
00:36:39,922 --> 00:36:43,420
areas that you've actually pointed out,

576
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,224
to see how we on our own with our existing resources.

577
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:50,816
I don't think this is something necessarily that we can do all three, but I

578
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:55,056
think in partnership with others, we can actually support some of the objectives of

579
00:36:55,078 --> 00:36:59,004
those three items that you just listed. Right. It was a conversation about growing

580
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:02,492
into oneself compared to being that tomorrow.

581
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:05,408
Understood. Thank you. Okay, thank you.

582
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:08,620
And thank you, Director Murray. And Ms. Jackson. Appreciate your insight.

583
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,050
Thank you. Thank you.
