WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:04.942
Speakers. And we will now be going

00:04.996 --> 00:08.446
to the City Council. Yeah, one of the,

00:08.548 --> 00:12.190
I would say being biased, one of the best departments.

00:12.530 --> 00:16.846
So at this time, I want to welcome Ms. Bernita Jones to

00:16.868 --> 00:20.602
provide the administrative office of City Council budget presentation

00:20.746 --> 00:23.854
and shout out to her whole new staff because she has a

00:23.892 --> 00:27.190
new staff with a lot of friendly and new faces.

00:27.530 --> 00:31.350
So thank you all for being here. Look forward to your presentation.

01:04.980 --> 01:09.020
It. Welcome, Miss Jones. And the floor is yours.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.090
Oh, all right, thank you.

01:12.180 --> 01:13.250
Get a break.

01:22.420 --> 01:23.650
That's a R.

01:38.900 --> 01:42.050
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.

01:43.140 --> 01:46.256
My name is Bernita Jones. I'm assistant director

01:46.288 --> 01:49.952
for Houston City Council. And today I will be presenting

01:50.016 --> 01:53.232
the FY 23 projected budget for City Council.

01:53.376 --> 01:57.190
But before I start, I would like to introduce my staff to you.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.444
On my right I have Mary Hamilton. He does the financial analyst

02:01.572 --> 02:04.904
for City Council. And if my new staff will please

02:04.942 --> 02:08.628
stand, I would like to acknowledge them. These are the individuals

02:08.644 --> 02:11.752
that take care of city council every day. They make sure

02:11.806 --> 02:15.324
that all of their needs are met. They work really hard and they

02:15.362 --> 02:18.396
always have a smile on their face regardless of what's going on. And I would

02:18.418 --> 02:21.150
just like to thank them. I appreciate each one of them.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.170
Next slide, please.

02:29.860 --> 02:34.036
Right here are 16 council members that

02:34.058 --> 02:36.832
are overlooking the beautiful city of Houston,

02:36.896 --> 02:40.304
Texas. And I would like to acknowledge

02:40.352 --> 02:44.736
the council members because every Tuesday constituents

02:44.768 --> 02:48.560
come in and they just hammer the mayor and the

02:48.570 --> 02:52.152
council member. And I would like to say that these City council member works

02:52.206 --> 02:56.104
very hard. They work hard and they're diligently looking after the

02:56.142 --> 02:59.428
city. They have CIP meetings, they have civic

02:59.444 --> 03:02.824
club meetings that they attend. They have town hall meetings. And they

03:02.862 --> 03:06.204
do a great job in making sure that the City of Houston is

03:06.242 --> 03:09.516
the best that it can be. And I thank each council member for the hard

03:09.538 --> 03:12.930
work that you do. Thank you. Next slide, please.

03:15.060 --> 03:19.068
Okay, now this is the organizational chart for the City of Houston.

03:19.244 --> 03:23.024
And in FY 22 we

03:23.062 --> 03:26.468
had approximately 78.4

03:26.634 --> 03:29.940
I can't see the screen 78.4 FTEs.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.176
In FY 23, we're proposing

03:34.208 --> 03:37.400
to have 79.5 FTEs.

03:38.140 --> 03:41.544
And as you can see, the budget for FY 23 is

03:41.582 --> 03:47.592
proposed to be $13,985,308

03:47.726 --> 03:51.416
for City Council as a whole. The budget as

03:51.438 --> 03:54.876
you go down, you will see, will be split between 16 council members and

03:54.898 --> 03:55.804
that would be $491,115.

03:55.842 --> 03:59.772
A little

03:59.826 --> 04:06.544
further, you go down and you see city council general. That's $627,466

04:06.662 --> 04:10.800
which is allocated for the health funds and the health insurance for

04:10.870 --> 04:14.804
city council members and their staff. The last allocation is for

04:14.842 --> 04:18.948
council district service funds. That's $5,500,000.

04:19.034 --> 04:20.230
Next slide, please.

04:24.770 --> 04:28.574
Next. We have the gender and the ethnicity, the demographics

04:28.622 --> 04:32.322
for City Council. There are 53 females and

04:32.376 --> 04:36.334
26 males that's working with City Council. And ethnicity.

04:36.382 --> 04:39.806
We have 29 white, 29 black African American,

04:39.928 --> 04:43.826
18 Hispanic Latinos and three Asian Pacific

04:43.858 --> 04:45.720
Islanders. Next slide, please.

04:48.410 --> 04:51.862
And right here I'm going to do a comparison and I really

04:51.916 --> 04:55.334
want to break it down because I want to make sure that we're open and

04:55.372 --> 04:58.666
everybody understand exactly how city council budget works. So I

04:58.688 --> 05:01.690
tried to break it down a little further on this slide to kind of explain

05:01.760 --> 05:05.514
exactly how it is. Our adopted budget in FY 22

05:05.552 --> 05:07.034
was $13,604,307,

05:07.072 --> 05:11.134
and that was split between

05:11.172 --> 05:15.582
the office at $468,915.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.942
So as you can see, the FY 22 operating budget

05:19.006 --> 05:23.506
was $7,502,640.

05:23.688 --> 05:26.882
This is the money that council members use to

05:27.016 --> 05:30.722
pay their staff for services and for office

05:30.776 --> 05:34.166
supplies. It all of this comes from their

05:34.268 --> 05:37.606
operating budget. So you make sure you understand that's what that is

05:37.628 --> 05:42.086
for. Then you have the council district service fund, which is 5,500,000,

05:42.188 --> 05:45.030
and the health benefits that I told you about earlier,

05:45.450 --> 05:51.050
that is how we comprise of 13,604,317.

05:51.390 --> 05:54.998
If you were to look at the budget book today, you will see that council's

05:55.014 --> 05:58.590
budget seems to have increased, but it has not.

05:58.740 --> 06:03.966
Literally, it hasn't. It is 15,000,508 $193

06:04.068 --> 06:07.534
as of today. And the reason for that, as you can see,

06:07.652 --> 06:11.874
we had restricted accounts, a credit of 5609.

06:11.992 --> 06:15.426
We had a Hope adjustment of 3%, and that was 130,480.

06:15.448 --> 06:19.294
And then we had a council

06:19.342 --> 06:22.674
district fund carry forward over of

06:22.712 --> 06:26.310
$1,779,005.

06:26.380 --> 06:29.654
I want to explain the carry forward for you in case some people

06:29.692 --> 06:33.446
may not understand what this is. In FY 21, all of the

06:33.468 --> 06:36.902
council funds and the projects that were requested.

06:36.966 --> 06:40.794
As you know, sometimes it takes a lot to get these

06:40.832 --> 06:44.314
done, and I want everybody to know that the council members work

06:44.432 --> 06:48.174
diligently. We have a process. First of all, it has to be reviewed by

06:48.212 --> 06:51.534
legal and then the administration has to approve it.

06:51.572 --> 06:55.422
So sometimes it takes a little longer for these projects to

06:55.476 --> 06:59.134
go into fruition. So if the project has been reviewed by

06:59.172 --> 07:02.366
legal and it has been approved by the administration,

07:02.478 --> 07:06.706
but we have not purchased the items yet or they have not completed it,

07:06.808 --> 07:10.194
those funds can be rolled and forwarded and carried over.

07:10.312 --> 07:13.510
So that's why you have a carry forward of 1,000,007, seven,

07:13.580 --> 07:17.330
nine, five. And that is why the budget looks like it increased

07:17.410 --> 07:20.360
at the present day. Next slide, please.

07:23.210 --> 07:29.562
So for now, we are projecting to have $13,985,308

07:29.616 --> 07:33.018
in city council's budget, and that comprises again of

07:33.024 --> 07:34.374
the operating budget,

07:34.502 --> 07:39.150
$7,857,842.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.782
Council district service fund,

07:40.836 --> 07:44.318
5,500,000, and health benefits,

07:44.404 --> 07:47.940
$627,466.

07:48.390 --> 07:49.780
Next slide, please.

07:53.070 --> 07:57.066
These are the It. As I stated before that a lot

07:57.088 --> 07:59.914
of times it seems as if the budget is big,

07:59.952 --> 08:03.866
but council member budget is mainly staff and driven

08:03.898 --> 08:07.406
by it. That is why these are here to show you some

08:07.428 --> 08:11.674
of the It driven costs that you will have application services increased

08:11.722 --> 08:15.502
by 30,657. And any hits questions,

08:15.556 --> 08:18.802
I would ask that you would direct that to hits, because these are the numbers

08:18.856 --> 08:21.966
that I received from the It department.

08:22.158 --> 08:26.370
Data services decreased by $11,283.

08:26.520 --> 08:30.294
Voice services decreased by $3,244.

08:30.412 --> 08:34.920
Voice labors decreased by $509. Next slide please.

08:35.610 --> 08:39.450
Egis revolving fund service decreased by $25.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.202
Voice Services wireless increased by $3,192.

08:44.336 --> 08:48.620
Chronos chargeback increased $247.

08:48.990 --> 08:52.586
Next slide please. Overall you

08:52.608 --> 08:54.166
can see as I stated early,

08:54.288 --> 08:58.142
91.39% of

08:58.196 --> 09:01.150
city council's budget is allocated to personnel.

09:01.490 --> 09:04.642
And then you have 7.28% which is in other

09:04.696 --> 09:08.318
services and charges. And out of the services and charges,

09:08.414 --> 09:11.970
78% is hits related charges,

09:12.470 --> 09:16.790
1.29% is supplies, and then you have 0.4%

09:16.860 --> 09:19.800
for equipment. Next slide please.

09:24.250 --> 09:28.246
So this is Council District Service Fund. Carry forward over from FY 21.

09:28.268 --> 09:32.090
As I stated before, there's 1,779,000

09:32.160 --> 09:35.642
worth of council district service funds that we had to carry over

09:35.696 --> 09:39.194
that were not completed in FY 21. We are

09:39.232 --> 09:43.174
proposing what we adopted 5,500,000 for FY

09:43.222 --> 09:46.686
22. As of today, we don't know how much will be

09:46.708 --> 09:50.766
carried forward to FY 23. We will know that amount on June 30.

09:50.788 --> 09:54.174
When the fiscal year ends, we are projecting

09:54.222 --> 09:57.406
to get another 5,500,000 in council district

09:57.438 --> 10:00.020
service Fund for FY 23.

10:00.790 --> 10:02.180
Next slide please.

10:04.550 --> 10:07.830
Right here are major projects, and I just want everybody

10:07.900 --> 10:12.086
to know that we have approximately 350

10:12.188 --> 10:15.894
to 400 council district service projects that

10:15.932 --> 10:19.290
are performed annually with this money. And on here,

10:19.360 --> 10:22.810
I just basically put the major

10:22.880 --> 10:27.146
projects, projects that are very expensive and

10:27.248 --> 10:30.726
a lot of funding is needed for these. So they have increased

10:30.758 --> 10:34.638
from last year. As far as major projects. On these two pages you can

10:34.724 --> 10:38.702
go through and see all of the major projects that the council members are doing.

10:38.836 --> 10:42.800
And as I stated, these projects are really

10:43.890 --> 10:47.554
important things to the city. That's why I say these council members are

10:47.592 --> 10:50.994
working hard. We go through legal. I know there's been a lot of talk about

10:51.032 --> 10:54.414
council district service funds, but legal reviews

10:54.462 --> 10:58.134
them, the administration approves it. We make sure that

10:58.172 --> 11:02.006
all contracts are accurate before we

11:02.028 --> 11:05.670
do any work with any of these major projects or any projects.

11:06.090 --> 11:07.560
Next slide please.

11:09.290 --> 11:13.146
This is a slide of the priorities and initiatives that

11:13.168 --> 11:16.282
the council members have stated are their top two.

11:16.416 --> 11:20.122
These are the top two, they have several, but this shows by

11:20.176 --> 11:24.282
district which initiatives they have stated to be priorities,

11:24.346 --> 11:28.046
initiative as their top two. And the next page shows

11:28.148 --> 11:31.450
the at large council district service funds,

11:31.530 --> 11:35.970
council district members. These are their priorities and their initiatives.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.500
Next slide please.

11:40.550 --> 11:46.370
Looking at this, you can see that $4,743,915

11:46.440 --> 11:50.582
are allocated to HPW, that is the council district's service

11:50.636 --> 11:54.466
fund, and it is broken down based on how much money we allocated

11:54.578 --> 11:57.430
in FY 22 for these projects.

11:58.250 --> 12:02.410
So HPW and HPD are the most ones that

12:02.480 --> 12:05.622
council district service funds are allocated to. Next slide

12:05.686 --> 12:08.854
please. Appendix and then in the appendix

12:08.902 --> 12:11.798
we have the restricted accounts, because as I stated,

12:11.894 --> 12:15.422
hits restricted accounts really has a major important part

12:15.476 --> 12:18.974
in the council members budget. Thank you for your

12:19.012 --> 12:22.606
attention. Are there any questions for me at this time? That was

12:22.628 --> 12:25.682
such a great presentation. You do an excellent job,

12:25.736 --> 12:29.390
you and your entire staff. Thank you. Council member

12:29.470 --> 12:30.290
Cayman.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.442
Ms. V, thank you for everything. You're welcome.

12:35.576 --> 12:38.854
And to the new staff, welcome. We're so

12:38.892 --> 12:42.440
happy to have you. And, of course, Miss Love, thank you for always

12:43.050 --> 12:44.120
being there.

12:46.170 --> 12:48.710
You do so much for our offices,

12:49.390 --> 12:52.970
from our budget meetings to, again,

12:53.040 --> 12:56.950
tracking, I think you said over 400 projects

12:57.110 --> 13:00.074
that we're each pushing through all of the time. So,

13:00.112 --> 13:03.822
again, huge appreciation to your office in terms

13:03.876 --> 13:07.930
of needs that you see either for your office specifically

13:08.090 --> 13:11.998
or as council, what do you foresee in the coming

13:12.164 --> 13:16.314
future as some of those needs? So I have conferred

13:16.362 --> 13:20.034
with several of the council members, and I do know that they

13:20.072 --> 13:23.602
are short staffed and the needs that they have in their office,

13:23.656 --> 13:27.074
if they could have more staff members, because right

13:27.112 --> 13:30.486
now they are stretched pretty wide based on all

13:30.508 --> 13:34.294
of the work that's going on in their offices. And there are minimum four

13:34.332 --> 13:37.766
to five staff members in every office, and the need to

13:37.788 --> 13:41.942
have more people in their office would be great. And I've always said

13:41.996 --> 13:45.274
that the council district service fund is great, and they've asked for

13:45.312 --> 13:49.046
more because they can't complete all of their projects because they're

13:49.078 --> 13:52.666
kind of waiting toward the end because they don't have enough money to do all

13:52.688 --> 13:55.360
the things that the constituents are asking for.

13:56.290 --> 13:59.594
I certainly echo the need for more staff,

13:59.642 --> 14:02.906
I think our council staff and a huge thank you to all of our council

14:02.938 --> 14:06.426
staff. We did a tally in a poll of

14:06.468 --> 14:10.226
our district, most, of course, per usual three

14:10.248 --> 14:13.890
one one calls, but also most calls of a district office.

14:13.960 --> 14:18.002
I don't know how my staff does it, but they're incredible. And we could always

14:18.136 --> 14:21.286
I think I speak for every at least district office of we could

14:21.308 --> 14:24.646
always use and at large. Okay. And at large, we can

14:24.668 --> 14:27.826
always use more. Just so, Ms. Vernita,

14:27.938 --> 14:30.070
for the public's knowledge,

14:31.530 --> 14:34.854
the council members, our salaries

14:34.902 --> 14:38.138
are not set by the city, is that correct? Yes.

14:38.304 --> 14:41.622
Your salary is based on the judges at the county.

14:41.686 --> 14:45.006
And in terms of I mean, we're covered by

14:45.028 --> 14:48.254
insurance and things like that. But as

14:48.292 --> 14:51.854
council members, we don't have things like FMLA, is that correct? That is

14:51.892 --> 14:55.454
correct. But we were able to get, at least for our chiefs of staff

14:55.502 --> 14:59.806
that had an exception previously, coverage for paid parental

14:59.838 --> 15:03.266
leave and other benefits. That is correct. Okay. I just wanted that

15:03.288 --> 15:05.300
to be clear. Thank you. Okay, thank you.

15:07.620 --> 15:11.190
Council Member David Robinson. Yeah. And just to build on that question,

15:11.800 --> 15:14.656
the recent Hope adjustment, ms.

15:14.688 --> 15:17.728
Jones, if you could comment on that, how that affected the salaries

15:17.824 --> 15:21.288
of our staff and for that matter, council members, if you

15:21.294 --> 15:24.088
could. I'm sorry. The hope,

15:24.254 --> 15:27.620
the city employment, the home contract

15:27.700 --> 15:31.176
yes. And what was the question, if you

15:31.198 --> 15:34.796
could state out loud for the record how that affected our staff and our

15:34.818 --> 15:39.084
personal salaries. So what happens is the

15:39.122 --> 15:42.636
increase is 3% and it is based on an average of

15:42.658 --> 15:46.332
the council members in their office. And because council members

15:46.386 --> 15:49.840
have to have the same budget, we average out the highest office

15:49.910 --> 15:53.760
and whatever that is times 3%, that is determined how

15:53.830 --> 15:57.128
we allocate the 3% and that increases everybody's

15:57.164 --> 16:00.916
budget the same. Thank you. But the council members do

16:00.938 --> 16:03.540
not get a 3%, right?

16:03.690 --> 16:06.550
Correct. That's what I wanted to hear. Thank you.

16:09.480 --> 16:13.156
Well, thank you again for your presentation. Thank you to your entire staff.

16:13.188 --> 16:16.696
We lean on you all for so much and kind

16:16.718 --> 16:20.504
of the backbone of our offices, which are extension of

16:20.542 --> 16:22.940
all of our constituents in each district and at large.

16:23.010 --> 16:27.310
So thank you again and you are dismissed. Thank you.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.504
We will now move on to the public comment

16:32.552 --> 16:35.932
period. We will start with the virtual public speakers.

16:36.076 --> 16:39.616
Please press star six to unmute when your name is

16:39.638 --> 16:42.396
called and the first name is ms.

16:42.428 --> 16:46.290
Saba Blandy. Good afternoon again.

16:47.220 --> 16:51.124
I had a question, a couple I was curious, what is

16:51.162 --> 16:54.276
one piece of information you would most like

16:54.298 --> 16:58.420
to know if you were able to survey every single one of your constituents

16:59.000 --> 17:03.160
and what do you think are the most effective efforts to engage your

17:03.310 --> 17:07.416
constituents in your district? And I'm just curious if anyone

17:07.518 --> 17:10.010
has some new efforts planned for the coming year?

17:12.300 --> 17:15.836
Okay, I'm going to ask you, Ms. Blanding, to repeat that a little slower one

17:15.858 --> 17:19.272
more time. Oh, man, I'm sorry, Councilman Member

17:19.336 --> 17:23.292
Pollard, I was trying to go slower. Okay. I was curious what

17:23.346 --> 17:26.988
one piece of information you would most like to know if

17:26.994 --> 17:30.396
you were able to survey every single one of your constituents?

17:30.588 --> 17:34.684
I was also curious what you think are the most effective efforts to engage

17:34.732 --> 17:38.596
your constituents in your districts. And I was also curious what

17:38.618 --> 17:41.350
are some new efforts planned for the coming year?

17:43.160 --> 17:46.420
Okay, so for my office, and I know for everyone,

17:46.570 --> 17:49.636
it's probably different, but one piece of information I

17:49.658 --> 17:53.156
would like to know is how they feel about our constituent response

17:53.188 --> 17:57.252
times when they reach out to our office, either by telephone

17:57.316 --> 18:01.144
or email. Do they feel as if their issues and concerns are

18:01.182 --> 18:04.724
being addressed promptly? I think the best way to

18:04.782 --> 18:08.824
engage the constituents is by showing up in person, whether that's an HOA

18:08.872 --> 18:13.070
or a civic club. But people like to see you active and in person.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.488
I think it's a great way to develop relationships and also a great way in

18:17.494 --> 18:21.452
which to communicate and understand their needs from the grassroots

18:21.516 --> 18:22.130
level.

18:24.660 --> 18:27.750
Anyone else in the horse you want to chime in?

18:28.680 --> 18:30.900
And your third question, Ms. Blanding.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.084
I was just curious if anyone had some new efforts they wanted to try this

18:36.122 --> 18:39.460
year in terms of engaging constituents.

18:39.900 --> 18:43.544
If anyone had some new ideas, what ideas do you

18:43.582 --> 18:44.170
have?

18:47.580 --> 18:50.856
Oh, well, I mean, I always

18:50.878 --> 18:55.240
think efforts to to provide surveys are good, and I know traditionally there's

18:55.920 --> 18:59.340
club engagement, but as much as I can engage here,

18:59.410 --> 19:03.196
civic club, my husband has a meeting every month for

19:03.218 --> 19:07.276
our civic club. So I was just curious what you all like to try.

19:07.458 --> 19:10.976
I think most of us like to get a lot of our ideas from the

19:10.998 --> 19:14.624
public. We really work for you. So many of the times that you see us

19:14.662 --> 19:18.070
responding to issues or concerns is based on

19:18.840 --> 19:22.564
your engagement. So it would be great to hear from

19:22.602 --> 19:26.244
you as a constituent, what ways in which you think we can

19:26.282 --> 19:30.356
better communicate and collaborate with you and

19:30.378 --> 19:33.556
the community. So if you have

19:33.578 --> 19:36.840
an idea or something you would like to share, maybe even not today,

19:36.990 --> 19:40.456
but feel free to email us if you have ideas on ways in

19:40.478 --> 19:43.710
which we can best communicate and engage with you going forward.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.684
Absolutely. I appreciate the invitation. You're welcome. The next

19:48.722 --> 19:51.500
speaker, Ms. Barbara Herndon.

19:54.950 --> 19:58.550
Barbara Herndon, please press star six to unmute.

20:06.940 --> 20:10.280
Amanda Shy, please press star six to unmute.

20:11.260 --> 20:14.728
Hi, and just briefly, my last name is

20:14.814 --> 20:18.430
she. Thank you. Thank you for your time today.

20:18.960 --> 20:23.004
So many of the other departments have

20:23.042 --> 20:26.156
metrics or outcomes outlined in the budgets that they

20:26.178 --> 20:29.196
publish. So as representatives of constituents,

20:29.228 --> 20:33.612
do you all have target metrics? What do you consider outcomes?

20:33.676 --> 20:37.136
And then I have another thought, which is

20:37.158 --> 20:41.104
that the slide 15 in terms of the distribution of the CDSF

20:41.152 --> 20:45.152
funds, that was really helpful. As a constituent

20:45.216 --> 20:49.204
of District I, I would just like to express that I'm interested in seeing more

20:49.242 --> 20:52.500
funds allocated for Case Education, Do,

20:52.570 --> 20:56.820
N, and HPL, all departments and programs that have expressed

20:56.900 --> 21:01.176
unmet needs throughout these presentations. So I'll return to

21:01.198 --> 21:04.644
my question, which is basically, what are some target

21:04.692 --> 21:08.316
metrics and outcomes that you

21:08.338 --> 21:09.390
all have in mind?

21:11.920 --> 21:15.100
So as it pertains to metrics, I can speak for the District J office.

21:15.170 --> 21:19.096
What we like to do is put out initiatives and projects and ideas

21:19.128 --> 21:22.544
that we have many times that are brand new, and then we

21:22.582 --> 21:25.696
have to wait and see what the outcomes are. We're really a

21:25.718 --> 21:29.312
results based office. And so whether it's with

21:29.366 --> 21:33.504
supplemental trash or a District J Patrol program, new initiatives

21:33.552 --> 21:37.488
that are just now coming to the district, many times it's

21:37.504 --> 21:41.284
going to be based off the feedback, the engagement, how many people are

21:41.402 --> 21:45.348
receptive, and responsive to the things that we're doing, the feedback that

21:45.354 --> 21:49.284
we hear at the civic clubs and the HOA meetings on if it's beneficial

21:49.332 --> 21:52.664
or not. Do they believe it's something that they

21:52.702 --> 21:55.784
want to see their tax dollars spent on? And for

21:55.822 --> 21:59.180
most of us, I think that's how we are able to gauge if a project

21:59.250 --> 22:02.504
is worthwhile going into the next budget

22:02.552 --> 22:06.350
year to fund through our council district service funds going forward.

22:10.910 --> 22:14.220
And was there one other question that you may have had.

22:18.350 --> 22:22.266
That was my main question. Do any of the other council members

22:22.368 --> 22:23.760
want to share?

22:27.410 --> 22:30.574
None at the moment, because I think we're running behind on

22:30.612 --> 22:33.774
time. But I'm sure if you reach out to your

22:33.812 --> 22:37.314
individual district council member, they will collaborate with you

22:37.352 --> 22:40.706
going forward. But thank you for your questions. Next is

22:40.728 --> 22:41.810
Jason Oliver.

22:44.390 --> 22:48.466
All right, if you'll indulge me, I want to start off just by really

22:48.568 --> 22:51.778
I really appreciate CDSF and these presentations

22:51.874 --> 22:55.794
because I know that you all create a lot of these programs

22:55.842 --> 22:59.062
directly in response to what community members are asking

22:59.116 --> 23:02.458
for. So some of the ones I'm excited about and glad to see, a lot

23:02.464 --> 23:06.330
of the trash pickup and drainage work, the Senior Development

23:06.670 --> 23:09.322
Boys and Girls Club and District K,

23:09.456 --> 23:13.238
the Public Safety, the more expansive public safety,

23:13.414 --> 23:16.494
street lights and sidewalks stuff happening in District F,

23:16.692 --> 23:20.398
seeing some of the Vision Zero. And then the

23:20.484 --> 23:23.680
WiFi access is huge in District H,

23:24.210 --> 23:27.934
there's a lot. And then the community beautification work

23:27.972 --> 23:31.026
that's happening in district, just some of the ones that kind of stuck out to

23:31.048 --> 23:34.770
me that I really wanted to highlight. And now to go into my

23:34.840 --> 23:38.178
questions. So first,

23:38.344 --> 23:41.202
where are we in terms of the impartment inspection reform?

23:41.266 --> 23:44.886
Just curious about that project that I know we've heard about over the years.

23:44.988 --> 23:48.706
And then second, does any district and this goes into Council Member Pollard's

23:48.738 --> 23:52.902
question about engagement with constituents.

23:52.966 --> 23:56.566
Does any district have good resources or processes explaining

23:56.598 --> 23:59.130
how the CDSF works to constituents,

23:59.950 --> 24:03.318
explaining how it works, what projects are proposed and eligible,

24:03.414 --> 24:07.454
and the process for submission? I think CDSF is a huge opportunity

24:07.572 --> 24:10.926
to widen the net of how people know about what

24:10.948 --> 24:14.894
the district is doing and then really getting engaged in that process of

24:14.932 --> 24:18.850
directly participating there. So, yeah, that's my idea

24:18.920 --> 24:22.930
for engagement. So regarding the apartment inspection

24:24.310 --> 24:28.378
ordinance, that is something that's pending at the moment. I know that Council Member Leticia

24:28.414 --> 24:32.054
Plumber is taking the lead on that. And so those

24:32.092 --> 24:36.130
discussions are still ongoing on the best considerations

24:36.210 --> 24:39.510
for that as it pertains to the council district service

24:39.580 --> 24:43.306
funds. Many times what we do is we reach out to all of our

24:43.328 --> 24:46.794
neighborhood associations and stakeholders within the community and

24:46.832 --> 24:50.106
ask them what do they like to see regarding if

24:50.128 --> 24:53.862
it's improved parks, if it's improved

24:53.926 --> 24:57.534
infrastructure, do they want to see more police presence? So every

24:57.652 --> 25:01.454
community and district is unique and has its own dynamics. And so

25:01.572 --> 25:05.118
many times the requests that come into our office for things that they want to

25:05.124 --> 25:09.074
see, we prioritize. And then those are what we spend the dollars on

25:09.112 --> 25:10.690
through our council's funds.

25:13.750 --> 25:17.646
Council Member Cayman Jason, to your question about outreach

25:17.678 --> 25:21.106
in terms of determining some CDSF, I know multiple council

25:21.138 --> 25:25.794
members, including my office, have started even doing surveys

25:25.842 --> 25:30.326
on social media. So, for example, we fund air monitors that

25:30.348 --> 25:33.786
are publicly accessible information. But where they should go up we put a

25:33.808 --> 25:37.382
survey out, we ask for suggestions, and the locations

25:37.446 --> 25:41.146
are being determined based on that. I think it's a whole combination of things.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.506
Council member newsletters always open to more information,

25:44.608 --> 25:47.786
but you are asking some really important questions.

25:47.888 --> 25:50.846
They're directed, I think, to all of us. But I think the best way to

25:50.868 --> 25:54.894
get some of those responses or provide your suggestions is to individually reach

25:54.932 --> 25:58.574
out on that and also know that we leverage

25:58.622 --> 26:01.906
a lot of our dollars. So even though we get a

26:01.928 --> 26:05.682
million dollars, 500 for mobility and then 500

26:05.736 --> 26:09.154
for just general operating projects in our

26:09.192 --> 26:12.754
district, we leverage that money with the management districts,

26:12.802 --> 26:16.326
with our Turs, with our county partners. So we try to find outside

26:16.428 --> 26:20.374
dollars, even from the private sector to partner with. So we

26:20.412 --> 26:23.542
may be able to turn $100,000 allocation

26:23.606 --> 26:27.466
into a $400,000 allocation just by working with other

26:27.648 --> 26:30.954
entities that have similar interests in what we're trying

26:30.992 --> 26:35.462
to do. So we appreciate all the constituents

26:35.526 --> 26:38.974
feedback on ways in which we spend your tax dollars.

26:39.092 --> 26:42.574
And if there's particular projects and initiatives that you see in your

26:42.612 --> 26:45.950
community that you like and you want to advocate for

26:46.100 --> 26:49.378
going forward, please do. And if there are things that you don't like or that

26:49.384 --> 26:52.626
you think are not beneficial that we're spending your tax dollars on, let us know

26:52.648 --> 26:56.642
that as well. And that completes our public

26:56.696 --> 27:00.530
comment period for the City Council presentations.

27:00.870 --> 27:04.580
And now we will move on to

27:05.510 --> 27:09.262
welcome director Tina Pius and Valerie Berry

27:09.326 --> 27:13.290
to provide the And Regulatory Affairs budget presentation.
