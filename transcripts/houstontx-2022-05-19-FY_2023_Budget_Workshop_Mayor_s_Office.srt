1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,694
I'm going to carry on now with our

2
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:06,874
next presentation for this budget workshop.

3
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:10,286
And now we will shift to gears to hear from

4
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:13,694
the Mayor's office. And at this time, I would like to welcome

5
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:17,994
our Chief of staff for the Mayor's office, ms. Marvelette Hunter

6
00:00:18,122 --> 00:00:21,610
and Valerie Barry, to provide the Mayor's Office department

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,602
budget presentation. I want to thank you all for your presentation station

8
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:29,638
and turn the floor to you. Excellent. Good morning,

9
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:32,994
chair and council members and council

10
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,834
representatives. I am here today with our CFO,

11
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:40,822
Valerie Berry, and Valerie has ridden side

12
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:44,442
chair with me for the last six budget presentations, so really

13
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:47,994
glad that she is here. We also have several members of

14
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:51,022
the Mayor's office executive team who are present,

15
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:54,362
and I would like for them to please stand and be recognized

16
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:55,200
right now.

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,346
Thank you all. I may have

18
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:10,130
a couple of them come forward during our Q and A time period.

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,226
If you have any additional questions that relate to their

20
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:17,782
specific areas of expertise. After I finish

21
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:21,366
the budget this year, I'm excited to be able to be here with

22
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:25,686
you in person instead of virtually, which was our last

23
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:29,474
fate. We have certainly had our fair share

24
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:33,274
of challenges through this administration, but just like

25
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:36,986
Houston, we've proven that we are resilient and that we can come through anything,

26
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:40,814
even a global pandemic. I'd like to publicly thank the city

27
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:44,654
of Houston for their support of Mayor Turner and this

28
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:48,334
administration. And I also want to thank the 22,000

29
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:51,610
employees who work tirelessly to serve

30
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,642
the citizens of Houston. Today.

31
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:59,054
I'm pleased to present to you the FY 23 Mayor's Office proposed

32
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:01,694
budget. And if we could have our first slide,

33
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:02,340
please.

34
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,072
Here is the Functional organization chart summarizing our

35
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:21,012
six General fund divisions. First,

36
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:24,688
we have our executive offices, which includes our boards

37
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:27,910
and commissions, education,

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,212
constituent services, community relations and our council

39
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:36,216
relations. Next we have our Agenda office,

40
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:39,530
the Economic Development Office, government relations,

41
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,988
Communications and our Veteran Affairs Office.

42
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:47,516
You'll note here the total budget for each of the

43
00:02:47,538 --> 00:02:50,876
six divisions as well as the number of

44
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:55,100
FTEs for each of those respective divisions.

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,570
Next slide, please.

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,444
There are two special revenue funds administered

47
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:09,952
by the Mayor's office. First, we have our Cable

48
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:13,760
TV Special Fund, whose functional organization

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,732
chart you see before you with the budget and the number

50
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:20,420
of FTEs that are represented.

51
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,570
Next slide, please.

52
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,504
You'll see here the other special fund, which is

53
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,860
our Tourism and Promotion Special Fund.

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,436
And this organizational chart shows the budget and

55
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:41,000
the FTEs for each of those respective

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,828
divisions. The tourism and promotion fund

57
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:48,492
includes our special events, trade and international

58
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:51,760
affairs, and it also includes cultural affairs.

59
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,850
Next slide, please.

60
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,092
The next four slides are going to share

61
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:04,390
with you our course services within the Mayor's office.

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,816
First we looked at divisions that are mandated by federal

63
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,216
or state statutes or municipal code. And then

64
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:16,116
we looked at divisions that were created to meet the needs of the citizens

65
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:19,816
of Houston. Now, although most of our divisions are

66
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:22,200
not statutorily required,

67
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,684
the citizens of Houston certainly depend on those services that we

68
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:29,580
provide on a daily basis.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,016
So on this particular slide, you see our Office of Education, our Boards

70
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:38,460
and commissions and our Constituent Services divisions.

71
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,416
And I just wanted to note just a couple of highlights from each one of

72
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:45,792
those and the rest is there for your reading but heart

73
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:49,400
Houston youth. That is one of the Mayor's signature initiatives

74
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,460
and that is administered through our Education Office.

75
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,828
And we are on track currently this year to provide 12,000

76
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:00,948
jobs for our youth ages 16 to 24.

77
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,552
And I will make note that when that program first started, we were only

78
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:08,196
providing 450 jobs. And now we have brought on the private

79
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:12,228
sector and all of the additional jobs now are private sector

80
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:15,708
related. I'll also

81
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:19,080
note that as far as our Boards and Commissions is concerned,

82
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,516
we have, and many people don't know this, over 160

83
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:27,696
Boards and Commissions, and that's a lot of people that

84
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:32,012
we have to administrate over. And then lastly, for Constituent

85
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:35,676
Services, just making a note that there are approximately

86
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,376
1400 pieces of correspondence that comes in to the Mayor's

87
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:42,896
office on a monthly basis. And with a very lean staff

88
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:46,836
of two, we're able to move that and be responsive to

89
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:50,070
the citizens of Houston. Next slide, please.

90
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,404
Here we have our agenda office, the Economic Development

91
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:01,600
office and the Special Events office. And all of these

92
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,664
are statutorily mandated. I wanted

93
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:09,492
to highlight a couple of things, and that is through our Economic Development Office.

94
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:13,584
This is our office that administers the tours, the management

95
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:17,412
districts, the tax abatements, and is responsible for

96
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:20,744
over $25 million in billings through

97
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:25,000
the Industrial Assessments each

98
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,216
year. And then I wanted to also make note of our

99
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:32,632
Special Events Office. Now that we are past COVID or post COVID

100
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:35,448
and beginning to return to our mini events,

101
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:39,004
this particular office produces about 2000

102
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:42,780
special events per year for the City of Houston.

103
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,650
Next slide, please.

104
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,644
Here we have our Intergovernmental Relations Office, our Cultural

105
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:57,636
Affairs, as well as our Veteran Affairs. And I wanted to

106
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:01,844
highlight that our Gr team was

107
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:06,612
mainly responsible for helping to bring $630,000,000

108
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,472
of ARPA funds, which is really being

109
00:07:10,606 --> 00:07:13,832
relied upon to help us get through not only this year,

110
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:17,220
but the next two years of deficits

111
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,970
that we were experiencing due to COVID. So very important,

112
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,824
their work that they're doing. And then our Veteran Affairs.

113
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:28,504
I wanted to point out that Houston hosts the second largest

114
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:31,310
veteran population in the country,

115
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,648
over 300,000 veterans, and this office basically

116
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:39,280
provides services, referral services to that population.

117
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,450
Next slide, please.

118
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,964
Lastly, we have our communications office and our trade and

119
00:07:57,002 --> 00:08:00,848
international affairs and also Houston Television.

120
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:04,068
And I wanted to point out that, of course,

121
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,444
communications statutorily required by the Texas

122
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:10,704
Public Information Act. But I wanted to point out that we receive

123
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:14,572
about 170 TPS per year and

124
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:17,900
over 270 requests for proclamations

125
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,852
or letters from the Mayor's office. And so that

126
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:25,456
is a very busy office with a

127
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:29,036
staff of two in trade and international affairs.

128
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:33,120
This office is critical in coordinating the Mayor's

129
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,376
abroad trade missions and also in marketing

130
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:41,044
the City of Houston as an international city which

131
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:43,888
we're very proud of. And then, lastly,

132
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:47,332
Houston television. And that

133
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:51,700
is mandated by Chapter 37 of the City of Houston Code of Ordinances.

134
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,024
And of course the impact is better transparency of

135
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:59,690
government and making sure that we have an informed public.

136
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,590
Next slide please.

137
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,516
This slide summarizes our revenues for the three funds

138
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:14,200
that are managed in the Mayor's office. We have our general fund

139
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,784
and we also have Houston television special revenue

140
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:21,260
fund and the tourism and promotion special

141
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,872
revenue fund. From our FY 22 estimate,

142
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:28,124
the General Fund has increased in revenues of

143
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:31,824
approximately $887,000 for

144
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,136
FY 23 and this is primarily due to the

145
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,300
projected revenue from the new Digital Kiosk,

146
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,924
which will begin generating revenue in the fourth quarter of

147
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:46,196
22. The revenue projected for FY 23

148
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:50,116
is for a full year of those revenues and

149
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:53,564
the revenue projection for FY 22 was only prorated

150
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:57,384
for a May start date. So there's also a

151
00:09:57,422 --> 00:10:00,904
$33,000 increase in the

152
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:05,280
Industrial District assessment revenue due to the expected

153
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,910
increase in taxable values by 6.3 million.

154
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,976
For our Houston Television Fund, we are projecting

155
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:18,732
an overall revenue decrease of 69,000

156
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:22,336
over the FY 22 estimate and

157
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:25,692
this is primarily due to the projected decrease of the Peg fees,

158
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:29,536
the public education and governmental revenues. And this is something that

159
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:32,868
I've been sharing with Council for the last few years.

160
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:37,024
That trend is continuing. Finally, for our Tourism

161
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:41,220
and Promotion Fund, we are estimating an approximate $2.95

162
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,092
million increase in revenue from our FY

163
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:48,452
22 estimates and the increase is primarily

164
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:52,004
due to the projected post pandemic

165
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:56,084
increase in hotel Occupancy tax revenues,

166
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:59,356
which we're very excited about based on information that

167
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:03,304
has been provided by Houston. First, as you will recall, the FY

168
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:07,116
21 revenues took a substantial hit as

169
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:11,104
a result of COVID nineteen's impact and

170
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:15,264
so we are now projecting for FY 22

171
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:18,992
having a gradual comeback and for FY 23

172
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:22,996
revenue budget reflects a very strong return

173
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:27,110
to pre COVID activity. Next slide please.

174
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,884
This slide reiterates the largest drivers of the revenue

175
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:46,444
increases and decreases for FY 23 and most of which

176
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:50,504
I discussed on the previous slide. General Fund revenue

177
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,128
from the Digital Kiosk contract,

178
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:56,808
HTV, the Peg, contributions from state franchise fees

179
00:11:56,904 --> 00:12:00,556
and a chargeback to funds for HTV.

180
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:04,172
And lastly, tourism promotion. The hot receipts

181
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:07,440
come back to pre COVID levels.

182
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,490
Next slide please.

183
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,356
This slide captures the expenditure comparison for all of

184
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:20,740
our funds between the year in FY 22 estimate

185
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,936
and the FY 23 proposed budget. So the

186
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,456
General Fund shows an expenditure increase of

187
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:32,424
$230,000 or 2.9%.

188
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:36,328
However, this percentage includes the net adjustments which I'll

189
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:39,804
talk about a little bit later for contractual municipal hope,

190
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,688
pay increases, health insurance and restricted

191
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:47,860
accounts. The almost $2.1 million

192
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,644
increase in Houston Television Special Revenue Fund is primarily

193
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:56,592
due to the projection in capital projects from

194
00:12:56,646 --> 00:12:59,916
year to year. So the FY 23 planned

195
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:03,892
capital project improvements include the upgrade for

196
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:06,980
the City Hall chambers, video control room,

197
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,544
which was much needed, the new build of the City Council

198
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:14,136
chambers and the terminal room along with the

199
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:18,072
few much smaller projects. So these funds are

200
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:22,232
capital dollars that are restricted for capital use only,

201
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:25,320
so they cannot be used for administrative purposes.

202
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,812
In the Tourism Special Revenue Fund, we project an increase of

203
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:34,780
$3.1 million in expenditures or

204
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,784
17.47% from the FY 22

205
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:42,524
budget. And this is primarily due to the increase in the city's

206
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,984
net receipts of the hot taxes and thus the

207
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:49,644
city's payment going out to the arts

208
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:53,744
partner houston Arts Alliance is projected

209
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,104
to increase. As noted earlier, our FY

210
00:13:57,152 --> 00:14:00,496
23 budget reflects a strong return to precovid

211
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:03,976
activity and therefore, again an increase in

212
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:07,620
the payment to the arts partner is anticipated.

213
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,130
Next slide please.

214
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,722
The next three slides provides a graphic representation

215
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:23,338
of our personnel versus non personnel budgeted

216
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:26,938
expenses for the Mayor's office's three funds.

217
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:30,738
So to elaborate on that, the Mayor's Office General fund

218
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:34,206
is 65% personnel expenditures.

219
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:37,538
Of the remaining 35%,

220
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:41,522
68% of that is for the general fund

221
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:45,510
transfer to subsidize special events.

222
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,322
So the restricted accounts comprise 22% of this portion,

223
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:54,578
leaving only 10% of the non

224
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:58,294
personnel budget for services and supplies and

225
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:02,438
those things like the novice account, office expenses,

226
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,100
travel, parking and the like.

227
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,900
Next slide, please.

228
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,218
The Houston Television Special Revenue Fund is 26%

229
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:22,270
personnel expenditures. Of the remaining 74%,

230
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,870
more than half is for the planned capital improvement

231
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,222
and more than a third is for the contractual payment to

232
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:34,094
Houston Media Source. And this is the city's

233
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:38,270
public access channel partner. The services and supplies

234
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,142
account for only 6% and the restricted accounts

235
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:45,570
also take another 6% of this portion.

236
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,110
Next slide, please.

237
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,460
Lastly, the tourism promotion special revenue fund

238
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,912
is 15% personnel expenditures and

239
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:03,344
85% other. And please keep in mind

240
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:07,132
that this is the fund where we receive our hot taxes. So therefore

241
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:10,480
the personnel budget is relatively very

242
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,170
small.

243
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,776
92% of the other charges are to pay the arts

244
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:21,076
partner for the hot agreement and then supplies and

245
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:25,450
services are there for only about 7% of the other

246
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,476
for the entire fund. Next slide

247
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:30,090
please.

248
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,104
This slide gives a great summary of the

249
00:16:37,142 --> 00:16:41,348
net change in expenditure budget from FY 22

250
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:45,492
to FY 23. The slide illustrates the net

251
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,444
increase of $230,000 from

252
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:53,732
the FY 22 budget to FY 23 proposed

253
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:57,464
budget. And this represents a

254
00:16:57,502 --> 00:17:00,872
2.9% change as

255
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:03,080
discussed on slide number eleven.

256
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,772
So beginning at the very top of

257
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:11,000
this chart, you'll see that the Mayor's office FY

258
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,652
22 operating budget is $6.95

259
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:18,476
million. So once we add to that our restricted

260
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:22,364
account budget of 621,000 FY

261
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:27,504
22 contractual municipal hope increases of 3% of

262
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:31,204
140,000 revised projection of

263
00:17:31,242 --> 00:17:35,284
restricted accounts of 76,000 the

264
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:38,980
FY 22 council surplus of

265
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,424
10,000, which was granted to us from council member Cisanero's

266
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:47,944
Office for an Intern, and the Mayor's Office of Education and

267
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:51,512
Funding for marketing specialists and special events and

268
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:54,984
program adjustments that we took in the Economic Development

269
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,924
Office for a total FY 22 budget of

270
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:01,644
$7.9 million.

271
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:05,464
Now, the next two areas, shaded areas on the chart,

272
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:09,580
the blocks include our proposed operating budget adjustments

273
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,004
for FY 23, and the first item

274
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:17,116
is the reverse of the one time funding from Council Member Cisnero's

275
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:20,096
office, the FY 22 surplus,

276
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,952
FY 21 surplus, and the balance of the annualized

277
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:27,680
funding amount for the economic development programming.

278
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,684
So, added to this are the contractual adjustments

279
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:36,324
for hope increases, health and benefits offset

280
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:41,512
by a reduction in the restricted accounts taking.

281
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:45,692
All of the increases and the decreases from the FY 22

282
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:49,292
operating budget yields the proposed FY 23

283
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:53,180
budget of $8.16 million

284
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,556
for the Mayor's office. Next slide,

285
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:57,170
please.

286
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,436
This slide provides a brief narrative of each fund's expenditure highlights

287
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:09,540
for your reference, and we discuss the expenditure highlights that are

288
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,868
listed on slide number eleven. The general

289
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:16,224
fund expense budget includes funding for contractual municipal

290
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:19,732
hope pay increases, health benefits and

291
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:23,524
restricted accounts. And some of the highlights of the fund include

292
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:27,252
funding for capital improvements through Houston Television

293
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:30,296
and in the Tourism Promotion Special Revenue Fund,

294
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:34,808
the increase being attributed to the increase in hotel

295
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:36,510
occupancy tax.

296
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,910
Next slide, please.

297
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,244
This concludes the financial portion of the Mayor's Office FY

298
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:52,464
23 budget presentation. For your reference, we have

299
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:55,840
included our office demographics and

300
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,932
some just some of our FY 22 accomplishments

301
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:03,260
in the appendix section. Thank you, and I'll be

302
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,852
happy to answer any questions that you may have. And we also

303
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,324
have our executive staff here in chambers to assist with questions

304
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,008
that you may have regarding their specific areas of focus.

305
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:17,880
I know that we have Andy Icken here from economic development.

306
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:28,018
Why don't you all stand up everybody.

307
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:31,746
So thank you all so much again. So we

308
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:35,326
do have Ted Irving who is here, we have representatives

309
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:38,706
from Veteran Affairs and we have representatives from

310
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:42,914
Special Events as well as our Executive Offices. So turn

311
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:45,766
it over to you. Any questions that you may have, we're happy to answer.

312
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:49,426
Thank you very much, Ms. Hunter. And your staff is well represented.

313
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,074
Great to see everyone here in the chamber with you. We also

314
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:56,694
have been joined by a few colleagues and staff

315
00:20:56,742 --> 00:21:00,506
members. Council member Sally Alcorn has joined us and has been here this

316
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:04,598
morning along with staff from council member Tasha Jackson

317
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:08,078
as well as council member Michael Kubosh's office. So I

318
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:11,626
wanted to acknowledge everyone here, we do have a couple of our council

319
00:21:11,658 --> 00:21:15,002
members in the queue before we get to our public speakers,

320
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:18,770
but first, let's hear from Council Member Alcorn.

321
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,210
Thank you, Chair, and thank you ms. Hunter,

322
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,546
the big increases were in the HTV and then to

323
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:29,394
the arts. I think I submitted those in writing, but you've covered them here.

324
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:33,318
So I appreciate that. If we could have you or Mr. Irving elaborate a

325
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:36,470
little bit more on the capital improvements that are being made.

326
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,742
This include what's already been done in the chamber? Is more stuff coming?

327
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:44,810
What's going on in the control room? A little bit more color around

328
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,266
what I will allow serving to provide a

329
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:51,862
little bit more detail regarding some of the improvements.

330
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:55,414
But as you recall, we did a lot of improvements

331
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:59,294
here. The lighting, of course, the sound. We still have

332
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:02,846
some additional work to do. And those funds that we have that

333
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:06,218
are part of the budget are specifically for capital improvements only.

334
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:10,210
So you will see some additional work, but I'll allow him to elaborate further.

335
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,514
Good morning. Good morning.

336
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:18,934
To answer your question on the capital improvements, the city

337
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:22,514
council horseshoe area was a phase

338
00:22:22,562 --> 00:22:25,846
one. And so the phase two is the control

339
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:28,600
room that is behind this space.

340
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,406
And at one point in time, that control room as

341
00:22:32,428 --> 00:22:36,070
well as the annex chambers control room had not been updated.

342
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,738
There have been no updates excuse me, since 1997.

343
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:43,766
They are extremely outdated. But due to the Cares

344
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:47,054
Act, the annex control room has been

345
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:49,994
modernized with virtual technology. In the next phase,

346
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:54,000
the new build that Chief Hunter is discussing that we are working to have

347
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,642
started here, hopefully in July, FY 23,

348
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:01,730
will be this control room to have it modernized.

349
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,942
Thank you, Council Member and Mr. Irving, I know having worked with you recently

350
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:10,834
on the technology, the TTI committee, we are still tweaking

351
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:14,386
some things. So, council Member, it is very much an ongoing

352
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:18,326
program with coordination with the speakers and the It

353
00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:22,086
platforms and HTV, of course, trying to coordinate

354
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:25,766
it all. So we thank you for that ongoing effort. Next we'll

355
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,090
hear from Council member Cayman staff.

356
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,846
Thank you, chair. Thank you, Ms. Hunter. Ms. Hunter, I was

357
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:38,202
curious if you could speak to, given the city's budgetary

358
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:41,486
constraints, any unmet needs or

359
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:45,390
really particularly critical unmet needs that you all have identified.

360
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:50,402
Well, I don't think we have any critical unmet needs

361
00:23:50,456 --> 00:23:54,466
at current. I think the biggest challenge that we face is that over the

362
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:58,290
last several years, we have trimmed our budgets and kept everything

363
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,474
very, very tight. And so in some instances,

364
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:04,754
we've actually had to eliminate vacancies.

365
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:08,454
And therefore our staffing is at a minimal right

366
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:12,514
now. So as we continue to respond to citizens

367
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:16,154
calls and all of the other things that we have to do within

368
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:20,134
the office, it does present a challenge. But as far as unmet

369
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:24,220
met needs, I don't think that we have any major ones at this point.

370
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,474
Thank you for that question. We have a follow up question now in the queue

371
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:32,394
from Council Member Alcorn. Thank you, Chair. On the Kiosk revenue,

372
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:35,966
how many kiosks does that represent? Trying to

373
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:39,646
remember. I think we have a contract for 25, but I'm going to have Andy

374
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,220
Icken to come forward and answer those specific questions. Thank you.

375
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,510
Good morning, Mr. Ickin. Welcome to the chamber.

376
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,546
Good morning. Chief of staff is correct. The first segment,

377
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:56,914
if you remember, council passed the first 25. We're well on the way

378
00:24:56,952 --> 00:25:00,626
to do that right now. They have been very well received and

379
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:04,086
the advertising revenue was exceeding the expectations that we had at that

380
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:07,654
time. I just saw one going in this morning as I was coming in

381
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:11,078
on Prairie and Fanon. So that'll be 25

382
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:14,760
within 75. 75 within

383
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,290
fiscal year 23. Yeah, we're doing about five a month right now.

384
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,226
That's the pace at which they are letting contracts and doing everything right

385
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:26,682
now. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't come back to us

386
00:25:26,736 --> 00:25:29,854
very soon. If remember, we put a pause at 25.

387
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:33,850
All the feedback we're getting, I'm not sure if council has any direct feedback

388
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,038
has been very positive. Thank you.

389
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:41,850
It might be helpful, director and chief,

390
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,086
to see a map of all of that. I know at some point to get

391
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:47,778
that update would be very we have such a map and we'll get that for

392
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:51,714
you. Excellent. Very good. Well, I believe that is it for comments from

393
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:55,526
the Horseshoe. Both council and staff have had their opportunity to

394
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:59,618
speak. So we'll turn to those in public comment

395
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:03,126
with the five virtual speakers that have signed up.

396
00:26:03,148 --> 00:26:06,682
We're seeing two of whom are here online or

397
00:26:06,736 --> 00:26:09,926
perhaps three. And we're going to start with Ms.

398
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:13,754
Saba Blanding. Ms. Blanding, we may 1

399
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:17,260
hear from you. Good morning.

400
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,614
Thank you for your time. I had a couple of questions.

401
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:25,694
The first was that on slide two it says the executive office

402
00:26:25,812 --> 00:26:28,698
develops and coordinates all city policies.

403
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:32,814
Can we return to a budget hearings where the public can ask department directors

404
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:36,306
their questions directly? If not, why not? And then

405
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,682
my second question is on slide 28. You mentioned

406
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:43,474
initiatives with Houston's unhoused community. What efforts are being

407
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:46,898
made to be proactive and mitigate evictions? Our housing

408
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:50,758
department is grossly underfunded with a budget of only $400,000.

409
00:26:50,924 --> 00:26:54,678
Houston renters, I mean, to quote the Houston Chronicle, houston renters are

410
00:26:54,684 --> 00:26:57,894
now more cost burdened and evicted at a higher rate than renters

411
00:26:57,942 --> 00:27:01,050
in Dallas, Chicago or Atlanta.

412
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,066
In 2019, one in eleven renter households in Harris County had an

413
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,314
eviction notice posted on their door. I know Harris and Houston are different,

414
00:27:08,352 --> 00:27:12,174
but we have a lot of overlap. And an analysis by the eviction lab

415
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:15,774
at Princeton University found 16 Houston apartment complexes have

416
00:27:15,812 --> 00:27:19,482
filed for more than 100 evictions each and over the course of the pandemic.

417
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:22,590
So the first question is about thank you, Ms. Landing,

418
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,330
Ms. Blanding, thank you for your question. Your time has expired.

419
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,714
Give the chief the option to respond. But I think we, as you

420
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:34,866
understand, have been restricted by the instruction

421
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:38,498
of the administration and seeing no council

422
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:42,022
members in queue to respond, we will move on to our next

423
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:45,574
speaker, who is Ms. Lien Chong. Ms.

424
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,434
Chong, if you're with us, we'll give you a moment to hit

425
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:52,886
star six to unmute or otherwise speak up and we'll

426
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:53,660
hear you.

427
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,094
Hello, can you hear me? Yes, Ms. Chong. Go ahead.

428
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:04,320
We hear you and see you online. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

429
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,290
Awesome. So I am an artist

430
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,534
and I'm an organizer for Arts Accountability Houston.

431
00:28:13,662 --> 00:28:16,962
And we have many engaged artists who

432
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:20,642
are advocating for

433
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:23,986
public funding for the arts here in Houston.

434
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:28,214
Now, we are aware of a proposal that's been sent to the mayor by

435
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:31,782
the Cultural District for Arca funding to

436
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:35,030
be allocated to the arts in Houston.

437
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,526
I'd like to sort of as a member of the public Advocate

438
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:43,274
for these fundings to go to

439
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:47,282
fund the arts here in Houston. I know it's not on the budget,

440
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:51,520
but we are curious to know when

441
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,022
these funds will be confirmed from

442
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:58,270
the city to support the arts here in Houston.

443
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,546
Any organizations are still suffering as

444
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:06,242
a result of the pandemic and we

445
00:29:06,296 --> 00:29:09,934
would really like for the city to allocate

446
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,410
ARPA funding towards the arts here in Houston.

447
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,354
Thank you very much, Mrs. Chong. We're well aware of the ongoing

448
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:21,542
challenges for our arts community and thank you very much

449
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:24,902
for bringing this question to council. It is something that

450
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:28,806
we are working on with local organizations and appreciate

451
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:32,506
you calling our attention to it and we will

452
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:36,394
stay vigilant with that item. Next, we'll hear from Mr.

453
00:29:36,592 --> 00:29:40,190
Yes, ma'am. Thank you. We will respond accordingly.

454
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,630
Our next speaker is Mr. Jason Oliver.

455
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,422
Mr. Oliver, if you're with us

456
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:51,090
or hit star six to unmute, I'm here.

457
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,610
Good morning. First, I want to speak up in

458
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,142
support of Leanne and the arts

459
00:29:58,206 --> 00:30:01,714
proposal. Like, there was significant losses and hot

460
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:05,862
taxes and using ARPA funds for revenue replacement would be

461
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:09,394
a great idea to kind of stimulate the economy and economic

462
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:12,902
activity in Houston. First, and so along

463
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:16,354
those lines, it's come up before, but I'm interested in the process for approving

464
00:30:16,402 --> 00:30:20,054
ARPA fund suggestions. Can you share that process and any rubric

465
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:23,546
that exists? Also, I would like to see the proposals that

466
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:27,466
have been received by the mayor's office thus far. And then second,

467
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:31,134
HTV feels like an under celebrated entity within the city,

468
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:34,382
but it's vital for transparency. As Ms. Hunter mentioned,

469
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:38,266
the expenditures accepting a two and a half million furniture

470
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:41,710
and equipment line item seemed flat decreasing over the past six years,

471
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,074
even with the pandemic going on. I'm wondering if

472
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:48,994
HTV saw an increased workload during the pandemic and if there

473
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:52,258
was an increase in overtime or other pay, because I'm not seeing it

474
00:30:52,344 --> 00:30:55,666
in the line items. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Oliver.

475
00:30:55,698 --> 00:30:59,094
I'm going to pick up on your final point there about the good work of

476
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:02,534
HTV. And I know council members have been

477
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:06,854
encouraged to utilize that facility and that

478
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:10,906
ability for us to really program according to some of

479
00:31:11,008 --> 00:31:13,914
the highlights of what we're doing around City Hall. So,

480
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:17,574
again, thank you for your question, for being here with us virtually.

481
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:21,118
And Ms. Hunter, again, I want to thank you for your presentation today,

482
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:24,042
for your team being here with us in chambers.

483
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:28,618
And with that, we will take a break and resume

484
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:32,366
after lunch this afternoon at 01:00 with presentation

485
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,794
of the budget workshop. Our next group to hear from will be

486
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:39,838
our legal department. And with that, our break commences.

487
00:31:40,014 --> 00:31:42,210
Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Council.

488
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,970
Share the investment priorities identified by the Eastwood Civic Association.

489
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,830
We need relief on three lines to improve mobility in our community.

490
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,382
I will speak to the Galveston sub and my neighbor Lindsay, who's up next,

491
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:16,082
will speak about east and west belts later on the Galveston sub.

492
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:20,142
Our top priority is an underpass on lockwood, which was in the presentation.

493
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:23,534
This is the expected route of Metro BRT's University

494
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:27,810
corridor line. But let me be clear. Our neighborhood believes an overpass

495
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,462
in this area wouldn't be the right solution. We are instead in favor

496
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:35,586
of a small underpass that would provide the community with one additional north south

497
00:32:35,618 --> 00:32:39,126
crossing, but still leave seven crossings aggregate that

498
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:43,002
are blocked daily. As such, I urge the city of Houston to also

499
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:46,902
seek funding for a rail improvement study on this line to explore alternative

500
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:50,726
solutions that address the entirety of the sub, not just one crossing.

501
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:54,526
And this needs to be done in conjunction with Metro to ensure solutions can

502
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:58,154
be expedited to align with the timelines for BRT construction.

503
00:32:58,282 --> 00:33:01,774
Thank you, Chair. My colleague Glimpsey will share priorities for East End,

504
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:05,026
West Belt or east and west belts in her remarks. Thank you.

505
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:09,006
Thank you very much, Ms. La Perrier, and we'll proceed

506
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,402
with the I believe hold on. Before you leave the podium, we have a question

507
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:15,538
from Chair Gallegos. Thank you,

508
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:19,446
Daniel, for being here today and representing Eastwood. Just for your

509
00:33:19,468 --> 00:33:22,982
information, a couple of weeks ago, I did meet with the new board

510
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:26,754
chair, Sanjay, and did bring that to his attention.

511
00:33:26,802 --> 00:33:30,218
He came into my office that there are concerns in regards to

512
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:33,466
the BRT going down lockwood, in regards to an

513
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:36,730
overpass that may be constructed or an underpass.

514
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,366
So they are aware of it and we are going

515
00:33:40,388 --> 00:33:43,898
to be monitoring it. Thank you. Thank you, council member.

516
00:33:44,074 --> 00:33:47,706
Proceed to our next speaker. Thanks again. Ms. Lindsay Williams

517
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:52,450
with us virtually and online. Proceed, ms Williams.

If you'd hit star six to unmute,

519
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,530
we'll await your comment.

520
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,790
Ms. Lindsay Williams,

521
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,200
online.

522
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,706
We see you online. If you can unmute

523
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:13,880
star six,

524
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,290
we can come back to you if there are technical challenges.

525
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,426
With that nice intro from Danielle, I'm sorry we can't take it

526
00:34:24,448 --> 00:34:27,180
right to Ms. Williams, but we'll come back to you if we can.

527
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,418
Mr. Tom Thompson, also online, virtually testing

528
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:35,310
our system here. Mr. Thompson, are you there? Are you able to mute

529
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,870
unmute, please. Unmute.

530
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,516
We see you, Mr. Thompson, and we

531
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:50,260
know we heard you at the public session this week at council.

532
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,400
We're checking our system to see if there's any technical challenges

533
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,072
right now, but proceeding with our list, a call for either

534
00:34:58,126 --> 00:35:00,890
Ms. Williams or Mr. Thompson online.

535
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,360
And while we're addressing the challenges there, we will proceed.

536
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:11,560
Present here in chambers is Punkaj Wadha.

537
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,800
Punkage is here with us. Let's hear from you at the podium,

538
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,892
sir. Thank you for being here. If you could state your name for the record

539
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:21,260
and proceed with your question or comment.

540
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,370
Yes, sir. Thank you.

541
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,424
Good morning. Good morning,

542
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:33,308
Council. Good morning. Thank you for holding this meeting. Thank you, BNSF,

543
00:35:33,404 --> 00:35:37,096
for being present, providing vital

544
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:40,932
rail services to our city and the country. I just want to say I love

545
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:44,532
trains. I enjoy counting train cars with my kids

546
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:47,472
as they roll by when I'm stuck at one of the block crossings,

547
00:35:47,616 --> 00:35:51,016
unfortunately. My name is Punkage Wadhwa. I'm part

548
00:35:51,038 --> 00:35:54,536
of the Houston Quiet Zones Committee, and I'm one of the residents in the

549
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:58,404
neighborhoods that are near the BNSF rail line that runs

550
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:02,300
parallel to the 34th street tracks just north

551
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,696
outside of 610 Loop on the northwest side from the neighborhoods

552
00:36:06,728 --> 00:36:10,588
from Oak Forest all the way to Independence Heights. As you can see on

553
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:13,932
the map I provided you guys, there are over 500

554
00:36:13,986 --> 00:36:17,344
households that have voiced their support for the 34th

555
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:20,560
Street Street quadzone corridor. Considering each

556
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,184
household typically has two to four residents, there are at least several

557
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:28,644
thousand Houstonians impacted by the train horns on this

558
00:36:28,682 --> 00:36:31,796
stretch of tracks. It's time to

559
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:35,476
silence the train horns in Houston's. People in countries around the

560
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:38,952
world live in communities that are much

561
00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:42,804
more dense without the obnoxiously loud train horns.

562
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:47,028
Houston can do the same. We don't live in the 18 hundreds with coal

563
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:50,564
fired trains belching out black soot black soot

564
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:53,756
and polluting the environment, do we? Then why should we live with

565
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:57,288
an outdated safety measure as a train horn? The train horn

566
00:36:57,304 --> 00:37:00,668
is the last resort for emergency situations, notifying anyone

567
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:04,176
to get off the tracks, same as it is for

568
00:37:04,198 --> 00:37:07,344
when we drive our vehicles. We don't honk our horn every

569
00:37:07,382 --> 00:37:09,200
time we drive through an intersection.

570
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,440
We don't honk our horn when we change lanes.

571
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,988
So we have safety measures in place. And we have the technology

572
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:21,296
to mandate, per the City of Houston infrastructure

573
00:37:21,328 --> 00:37:24,996
Design manual, to put these measures in place and have horns only as

574
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:28,772
a last resort. Per the FRA.

575
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:32,170
The City of Houston has the authority to mandate this,

576
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,404
to put effective quiet zones in place, as you guys have discussed earlier

577
00:37:36,452 --> 00:37:40,056
today, and I know you guys are in process of doing that, but we

578
00:37:40,078 --> 00:37:43,436
need to do this now. It's long awaited. You guys are

579
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:47,292
part of the quality of life committee. It's now time to make this better

580
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:51,576
for all citizens. Quality of. Life, especially the thousands of Houstonians

581
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:54,928
that have just advocated for this. If I

582
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:58,736
may have one more minute. Well, you can conclude your remarks. Yeah,

583
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:02,192
I have one more minute. I'll give you a few more seconds. I'm speaking

584
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,664
on behalf of thousands of members of we have a long way to go today,

585
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:09,216
Mr. Padwa. Thank you. Okay. Regarding funding and costs of the quiet

586
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:13,136
zones, I don't think the city should be burdened with this, nor the taxpayers.

587
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:17,652
Let's look at BNSF's financial statement. In 2021,

588
00:38:17,706 --> 00:38:21,716
they had 22 billions in revenue, 13 billions in expenses,

589
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:25,496
with a net income of 7 billion. Now, if you look at the

590
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:29,000
number, 350,000 was mentioned earlier as a cost

591
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,144
per. If you'd like to intersection,

592
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:35,436
we can take your comment online and we'll be happy to post it and

593
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:38,844
circulate it to the committees. But thank you again for being

594
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:42,428
here. I appreciate asking your question. I appreciate you allowing me to speak.

595
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:46,636
If you could wrap up, you're looking at 0.3% of BNF's profits

596
00:38:46,748 --> 00:38:50,208
to implement a $2 million quiet zone along the

597
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:53,796
34th street corridor. Thank you

598
00:38:53,818 --> 00:38:55,830
very much. Appreciate that.

599
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,388
Proceeding now to our next speaker. We're going to try again for online.

600
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:05,868
Our speaker is Ms. Orlando Pulito.

601
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,930
Ms. Pulito, if you're here,

602
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,616
please join. There you are. Okay, thank you.

603
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:14,730
Ms. Pulito, we can hear you. Hello?

604
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,636
Go ahead, ma'am. We can hear you. Okay,

605
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:24,924
thank you for allowing me a few minutes to speak. So I

606
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,924
submitted in writing my concerns to back up

607
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:32,384
what I'm speaking of today. So with the railroad I've been in this

608
00:39:32,422 --> 00:39:36,304
community for a very long time, and I'm just

609
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:39,984
very upset. The fact that the railroad is sitting there

610
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:43,240
talking about they have daily conversations,

611
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,864
monthly meetings, but yet there's no solution. In addition

612
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:52,096
to this blocking of vehicles

613
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:55,376
having to reroute include massive 18 wheelers

614
00:39:55,408 --> 00:39:59,064
trying to get to these back industries, these are

615
00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:02,276
neighborhoods. These are small streets. And these massive trucks

616
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:05,924
navigating through the community are not only tearing up our streets,

617
00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:09,108
but more importantly, we have a trail,

618
00:40:09,204 --> 00:40:12,696
walking trail. We have a park, but our wires

619
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:16,476
sit low when they come through here, and I've already reported this numerous times,

620
00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:20,076
they cause damage to my house in more ways than one. They have

621
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:23,872
popped my Internet wires, causing my whole house

622
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:27,072
to be damaged. They forced their way

623
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:30,976
in anyhow possible any way possible. And I've submitted pictures of

624
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:34,536
that. We have children riding their bikes.

625
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:37,300
We have people. We have older seniors walking.

626
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,308
These trucks are trying to get to this industry. They're trying to

627
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,990
exit this industry. Our community streets are not for that.

628
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,736
And the young man before me was talking about

629
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,480
the revenue. Yeah, there has to be alternative ways

630
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,936
in these meetings that they have to put this revenue in

631
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,790
effect. But more importantly is,

632
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,670
yeah, we need solutions and we need them quickly.

633
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,648
Thank you very much, Ms. Pulito. We do have the handout that you brought

634
00:41:08,744 --> 00:41:12,656
or delivered to us with the photographs that you mentioned. So thank you

635
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:16,416
for that, and we

636
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:20,044
will post those and circulate. So thank you again for your comments

637
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:23,568
and being here. Seeing no questions from the council, we're going to proceed to the

638
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:27,112
next speaker, which is Ms. Mara Gomez.

639
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,288
Ms. Gomez is here with us in City Hall chambers,

640
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:34,244
so thank you for being here. If you join us at the podium, we'd love

641
00:41:34,282 --> 00:41:37,320
to hear your comment or question today for the council.

642
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,530
If you could identify yourself. Yes, good morning.

643
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,796
My name is Mana Gomez, and I am with Link Houston, a nonprofit

644
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:49,436
that advocates for a robust and equitable transportation network so that

645
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:53,464
all people can reach opportunity. Today, I am addressing this joint committee

646
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:56,840
about the increasing burden train blockages continue to pose

647
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,036
for transit riders, bicyclists, and pedestrians in

648
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:04,364
the East End and Fifth Ward communities. Link Houston

649
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:08,096
shares many of the concerns residents are sharing with you today.

650
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:12,092
I live in the East End, so I experience firsthand the impact

651
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:14,500
these train blockages have on our communities.

652
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,312
We are forced to reroute to access jobs,

653
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:22,064
education, health care and wellness,

654
00:42:22,192 --> 00:42:25,616
recreational opportunities, and other essential destinations.

655
00:42:25,728 --> 00:42:28,984
For example, while riding Metro's 40 local bus

656
00:42:29,022 --> 00:42:32,712
route, one day, the driver had to reroute along the I 45

657
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:36,184
frontage road and missed ten stops on both

658
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:39,772
sides of the train blockage. Several Metro bus routes are

659
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:43,768
often forced to redirect when trains block a crossing,

660
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:47,960
causing people to be late to their destinations. Some pedestrians,

661
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,532
school age children included, go under or over in between

662
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:55,116
the cars of trains of stopped trains blocking

663
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:58,704
their route and risk their lives by doing so. Pedestrians will

664
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,476
try to find the quickest way to their destination, especially if they're

665
00:43:02,508 --> 00:43:05,350
being late affects their quality of life.

666
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,424
Additionally, they can force bicyclists to reroute

667
00:43:09,472 --> 00:43:12,692
onto busier streets, which may not have the built in

668
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:16,060
infrastructure to afford sufficient safety.

669
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,860
So today, we ask the Federal Railroad Administration,

670
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,524
Up, BNSF and the KCS rail

671
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:27,416
companies to work with our local elected officials and communities to

672
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:31,624
find the best community driven solutions to these train blockages

673
00:43:31,752 --> 00:43:36,072
with our most vulnerable road users in mind, and without further dividing

674
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:38,940
the communities the railway infrastructure goes through.

675
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,548
And we ask our elected officials to help hold these companies accountable

676
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:46,992
and do right by the communities they operate in.

677
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:50,556
Your efforts to remedy these issues will remove adverse

678
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:54,144
barriers and bring about equity in historically underserved

679
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:56,736
areas. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ms.

680
00:43:56,768 --> 00:44:00,144
Gomez, for your comments. Seeing no questions in the queue,

681
00:44:00,192 --> 00:44:03,088
we'll proceed. I see that Ms.

682
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:06,868
Williams has rejoined us or hopefully is able to

683
00:44:06,954 --> 00:44:10,216
unmute Ms. Williams. Can you do that? There you

684
00:44:10,238 --> 00:44:14,280
are. Yes. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. Loud and clear.

685
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,132
Perfect. My name is Lindsay Williams. I'm the Eastwood Civic

686
00:44:18,196 --> 00:44:21,832
Association train committee chair, continuing to share our investment priorities.

687
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:25,128
Danielle started with on the west belt. We agreed

688
00:44:25,144 --> 00:44:28,536
with the prioritization of York Street, presented by staff and included

689
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:32,456
in the ten year old rail district study. However, there is a critical missing

690
00:44:32,488 --> 00:44:36,352
piece in Phase one needed to address the Nhhips plan.

691
00:44:36,486 --> 00:44:40,256
In anticipation of the closure at Polk and St. Emmanuel, we would urge the

692
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:43,964
inclusion of an underpass at Leland as an equal priority. To allow Eastern

693
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:47,696
residents a straight access to downtown on the East Belt,

694
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:50,656
the community desperately needs at least one east west crossing,

695
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,480
either at Polk lawndale or telephone. Each crossing has its merits.

696
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,244
Polk serves as a route for Metro buses, lawndale would provide better

697
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:01,716
access to Kip School and post office, and the telephone may undergo

698
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:05,444
a complete transformation if the raised grant and Terra's 23 partnerships

699
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:08,536
come through. There are test choices, but we'd be happy to work with

700
00:45:08,558 --> 00:45:11,884
the city to engage with the community on which crossing they would like to see

701
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:15,368
prioritize. Moving on from infrastructure to Quiet Zones

702
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:19,304
since at least 2011, the neighborhood has been seeking quiet zones

703
00:45:19,352 --> 00:45:23,668
across the West Belt, East Belt and the Galveston Line. Each time, there's something preventing

704
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:27,068
quiet zones from moving forward, funding other priorities, or waiting

705
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:30,396
on no horn signs. Council, there are new Bil grants

706
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:33,888
which could solve for funding. We could

707
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:37,216
have had quiet zones implemented a long time ago with the use of grants to

708
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:40,996
improve infrastructure, but it feels like our voices have gone unheard. Money is

709
00:45:41,018 --> 00:45:44,244
available now, and there seems to be no urgency at the city to apply for

710
00:45:44,282 --> 00:45:48,080
dollars to improve quality of life in the East End. Projects have historically

711
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,816
been focused on the West Side, and it's time to see dollars helping those who

712
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:54,984
live east of I 45 put the money where the problem is,

713
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:58,644
and it's in the East End. Chicago is already celebrating Bil

714
00:45:58,692 --> 00:46:02,220
dollars that they expect to receive, and we are already behind.

715
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,884
So, passing it back to council, how soon do you expect to have the first

716
00:46:05,922 --> 00:46:09,950
proposals ready for funding from the Bil? And I hope you have an answer.

717
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,304
Well, Ms. Williams, I want to thank you for being here and asking your

718
00:46:14,342 --> 00:46:17,664
question. I don't see any council members jumping at the

719
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:19,360
opportunity to respond,

720
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,216
but at the same time, well, there we go. We've got Council Member Chair

721
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:29,108
Alcorn here to address you. Ms. Williams. Thank you. Good question.

722
00:46:29,194 --> 00:46:32,608
And we'll find out. And I just want to say I'm

723
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:37,188
so impressed with the Eastwood residents. I mean, you guys not only know

724
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:41,108
your comments are with such specificity that is so helpful

725
00:46:41,204 --> 00:46:45,320
about what you exactly want. You have a lot of knowledge about the funding opportunities.

726
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:49,576
You guys know your stuff. And I for 01:00 a.m. Impressed by that and

727
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:53,276
will certainly do what I can to advocate for

728
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:57,292
what you're talking about. We are working very hard here.

729
00:46:57,426 --> 00:47:01,100
Thank you, Ms. Williams. We have council member Gallegos also in the queue.

730
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,008
Thank you, Ms. Williams, for taking time to be here.

731
00:47:05,174 --> 00:47:09,216
Just for your information, we have submitted a request to

732
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:13,292
congresswoman Garcia and congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee

733
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:16,596
for funding for community project for the

734
00:47:16,618 --> 00:47:19,984
east end quiet two zone. So we're

735
00:47:20,032 --> 00:47:23,716
hoping that that will be approved. Thank you. Thank you

736
00:47:23,738 --> 00:47:27,332
council member, and thank you Ms. Williams, for being here again

737
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,840
for your leadership in the community and bringing your question today.

738
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:34,024
So with that, we're moving on to the next speaker. We're going to try again

739
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:37,320
for Mr. Tom Thompson if he's back online

740
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:41,576
and able to join us, star six to unmute.

741
00:47:41,768 --> 00:47:45,356
Otherwise, we're going to proceed with the

742
00:47:45,378 --> 00:47:48,680
next speaker, which is Ms. Amy Din. Amy din

743
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,510
virtually with us, I believe.

744
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,250
Amy, are you there?

745
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,586
We're seeing you online but hearing nothing. Can you join

746
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:03,920
us with star six?

747
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:10,434
If not, we will proceed and hopefully get back from

748
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:14,530
you. The next speaker on the list is Mr. Clay Dippel.

749
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:19,646
Clay, glad you're with us. If you could approach to the podium,

750
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:23,286
happy to hear your question or comment today. If you could identify yourself for the

751
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:26,754
record. Thank you very much. I'm Clay Dippel,

752
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:30,150
I'm also a resident of Eastwood. I want to thank you committee members,

753
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,086
elected officials, chief pena, thank you. And to the railroads.

754
00:48:34,118 --> 00:48:37,946
I also regret that the FRA could not make it. We have

755
00:48:37,968 --> 00:48:41,254
established in several public meetings that the train blockages

756
00:48:41,302 --> 00:48:44,570
in the east end have been increasing in frequency and in duration,

757
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:48,698
all while the trains themselves get longer, while Houston's

758
00:48:48,714 --> 00:48:52,302
population grows. Union pacific tells us they expect train

759
00:48:52,356 --> 00:48:56,274
traffic through our neighborhood is only going to increase with

760
00:48:56,312 --> 00:49:00,206
just a $30 security camera at just one crossing

761
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:04,034
in Eastwood, private citizens have unmassed an incredible amount

762
00:49:04,072 --> 00:49:07,458
of data to prove the scope of the blockage problem.

763
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:11,142
It's measurable, it's persistent, and it's about public

764
00:49:11,196 --> 00:49:14,354
safety. The problem is only going to get worse.

765
00:49:14,482 --> 00:49:18,022
We come now to urge the council to work with city public works starting

766
00:49:18,076 --> 00:49:21,942
today to use this data and the data from these pilot surveillance

767
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:25,178
programs to create a concrete action plan.

768
00:49:25,344 --> 00:49:29,066
We want to know how Houston can apply and allocate for

769
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:33,058
infrastructure dollars for grade separated underpasses completion

770
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:37,118
of long promised quiet zones and additional improvement studies so that a

771
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:41,162
comprehensive plan can give your constituents a clear understanding

772
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:44,622
of which projects you intend to apply for in each

773
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:47,860
year of the BIL's five available years.

774
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:51,470
Rail operators have long treated our neighborhood,

775
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:54,594
Eastwood like a parking lot for trains that are too long

776
00:49:54,632 --> 00:49:58,242
by their own standards to fit in the switching yards built to accommodate them.

777
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:01,250
They don't even know which intersections they're blocking.

778
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:05,254
The people who live and work and shop and invest here want to see

779
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:08,150
boots on the ground to secure funding for a fix.

780
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,718
Please take ownership of this issue. Council members,

781
00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:15,274
you are our voice. We need you to speak up for us. And I end

782
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:18,934
with a question for council. What are the city of Houston's funding

783
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:22,474
request priorities for alleviating rail blockage issues? And how

784
00:50:22,512 --> 00:50:25,934
do you intend to involve the community in deciding which of these

785
00:50:25,972 --> 00:50:29,246
improvements come 1st? First of all, Mr. Dibble, thank you very

786
00:50:29,268 --> 00:50:32,798
much for being here today. And for your question for

787
00:50:32,964 --> 00:50:35,390
response is Chair Gallegos.

788
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,110
Thank you, Chair. And thank you, Clay, for your continued advocacy.

789
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,758
I know you and others were at the town hall

790
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:48,038
held by the Easton Chamber as well as the Fifth Ward and

791
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:51,922
there at Guadalupe Church with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.

792
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:55,798
And thank you for the nice handwritten note. Appreciate that as

793
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:59,538
well. Thank you. Also, I just want to say

794
00:50:59,644 --> 00:51:03,814
that's why it's so important that Union Pacific and Burlington

795
00:51:03,862 --> 00:51:07,322
Northern are aware of this

796
00:51:07,376 --> 00:51:11,014
triangle wish affects Eastwood Fire Station

797
00:51:11,062 --> 00:51:14,910
18. Again, it doesn't happen often, but it does happen

798
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,862
where there's a train on all three tracks. So you're talking about

799
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,470
residents, you're talking about emergency vehicles.

800
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:25,810
Again, you're talking about parents that can't take their kids to school or

801
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,582
pick them up after school. So it's just chaos.

802
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:33,154
And that's why I'm asking Burnington Northern and Union Pacific to look

803
00:51:33,192 --> 00:51:36,638
at this triangle and ask your dispatchers

804
00:51:36,814 --> 00:51:40,054
to not stop trains within this triangle because

805
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:43,446
it impacts quite a few residents. Thank you. Thank you,

806
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:47,302
ma'am. Thank you, Chair. Great question. Appreciate you being here.

807
00:51:47,436 --> 00:51:51,026
Our next speaker is Ms. Erica Miranda,

808
00:51:51,058 --> 00:51:54,570
who I believe is online. This is Amy Den.

809
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:58,086
Okay. Can you hear me? Yeah. Let's hold off on the question for Ms.

810
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:01,546
Miranda and go back on our list for Ms. Din. We can hear

811
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:04,800
you, Amy. Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry,

812
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:09,006
somehow we had a misconnection, so my name

813
00:52:09,028 --> 00:52:13,054
is Amy Denn. I'm the president of Super Neighborhood 64 and 88.

814
00:52:13,092 --> 00:52:16,926
We appreciate your having the second meeting on railroad operations

815
00:52:17,038 --> 00:52:19,950
after the January 2022 meeting.

816
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:24,494
Since your first joint Committee meeting in January, our Super Neighborhood conducted

817
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:27,842
a community survey regarding railroad impacts. And Mr.

818
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:31,702
Hannigritt presented at our February 9, 2022 Super

819
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:35,398
Neighborhood meeting to share the information with our community members specific

820
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:39,506
to our neighborhood. We also shared these results of that community survey

821
00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:42,874
with Mr. Hannigriff, and we're happy to share that information with

822
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:46,006
any of the council members that are interested. We are glad

823
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:50,166
that Council is continuing to engage on this issue, the current railroad operations,

824
00:52:50,278 --> 00:52:53,766
our safety issues for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles

825
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:57,086
in our Super Neighborhood and their quality of life issues because of the

826
00:52:57,108 --> 00:53:01,102
horns, noise, and impact of productivity for those traveling to work or school.

827
00:53:01,236 --> 00:53:03,914
Our survey revealed the following concerns.

828
00:53:04,042 --> 00:53:07,858
First extended and repeated block crossings for many hours

829
00:53:07,944 --> 00:53:11,794
at Lawndale and telephone by the Kip post office at

830
00:53:11,832 --> 00:53:15,234
Leland and Scott at Lockwood at

831
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:19,778
Rusk and Harrisburg on Hughes Street at Polk and Harrisburg

832
00:53:19,874 --> 00:53:23,126
on Griggs at Redwood and Bobby Lee at the

833
00:53:23,148 --> 00:53:26,646
Gus Worthham Golf Course, blocking the pedestrian bike and

834
00:53:26,668 --> 00:53:30,682
Bayou Trail to Capitol Street for hours on Saturday morning.

835
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:34,566
The Dumble and Harrisburg Intersections.

836
00:53:34,598 --> 00:53:38,442
And at 1500 Telephone Road near Sierrajo We

837
00:53:38,496 --> 00:53:42,134
also experienced regularly horn noise

838
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:45,834
during the day and night and specifically illegal dumping

839
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:49,774
along the rail line at 300 north 67th

840
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:53,214
street in Houston, Texas. 77011 was

841
00:53:53,252 --> 00:53:56,514
reported. We thank you for listening to our concerns and giving

842
00:53:56,552 --> 00:54:00,370
us this form. The results of our survey are available by request.

843
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,642
You can send the request to me and I'm listed under Super

844
00:54:04,696 --> 00:54:07,826
Neighborhood Council information. Thank you. Thank you,

845
00:54:07,848 --> 00:54:11,398
Ms. Stan. Appreciate your comments and your ongoing work

846
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:15,240
on the issue as well. All right, we're now going to try for

847
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,046
excuse me. Hold on, Amy. Council Member Gallegos would

848
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:22,426
like to address you. Thank you, Amy. I just want to say thank

849
00:54:22,448 --> 00:54:26,310
you for being here again. I know you addressed us in the January

850
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:30,406
meeting that we had. And thank you for representing

851
00:54:30,438 --> 00:54:34,270
the Eastwood Lawndale Wayside super neighborhood again.

852
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,440
Twice in January and today. So thank you.

853
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:42,394
Thank you, Ms. Din. Our next speaker is Ms. Erica Miranda,

854
00:54:42,442 --> 00:54:45,842
who is with us virtually. If you're online, speak up

855
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:48,290
or hit star six to Unmute.

856
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:53,330
Ms. Erica Miranda.

857
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:58,454
Okay, we'll put a hold on, Erica. If you join us,

858
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:01,446
please let us know or I'm here.

859
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,630
There you are. Okay, very good. Go ahead, Ms. Miranda.

860
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,350
Erica miranda. I'm an Eastwood resident.

861
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:13,500
I just wanted to say maybe the city

862
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,526
and the railroad can work on the low hanging

863
00:55:17,558 --> 00:55:21,178
fruit, meaning the easy things. I would think

864
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:24,766
that it doesn't involve logistics because I work in

865
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:28,654
logistics and I know how hard that can be. But I'm thinking putting

866
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:32,206
up quiet stone signs does not inflict on

867
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:35,280
logistics. So that's something that can be worked on.

868
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:39,906
Also putting signs for alternate routes because there

869
00:55:39,928 --> 00:55:43,346
are bus drivers that are new and they don't know the

870
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:46,846
routes around the neighborhood, it would be good for them along with

871
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,640
bus drivers both school and public.

872
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:55,222
Also, one of the roads that is used for

873
00:55:55,276 --> 00:55:58,754
an alternate route coming off is Broadmore.

874
00:55:58,882 --> 00:56:02,682
I know my mother lives between Broadmore and Munger and

875
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:06,860
the speed sometimes people are going 40, 50 and

876
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:11,446
maybe putting speed bumps or signs saying what the speed

877
00:56:11,478 --> 00:56:14,766
limit is would be good. Also, one of

878
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,958
the roads that is used to do the back way to get access

879
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:22,894
to the access road and then get into the neighborhood again is

880
00:56:22,932 --> 00:56:27,698
Knock Block Street. So that street is very

881
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:31,714
there's a lot of potholes. It's very narrow and it does need to be

882
00:56:31,752 --> 00:56:35,700
fixed, I think for the time being until data is

883
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:41,042
put together and a long term or midterm solution

884
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,870
is done, maybe something like this can be a short term solution.

885
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,934
And also on the long term to think whether

886
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:52,186
it's an overpass or an underpass, think of the

887
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:56,186
people that walk. I know my mom walks to

888
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:59,562
the grocery store, so sometimes she's stuck waiting for

889
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:03,434
the train to start moving and sometimes she's waiting two or 3 hours

890
00:57:03,552 --> 00:57:07,738
because of the whole COVID thing. She was not taking public transportation,

891
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:11,246
but instead she was walking and so her trip to

892
00:57:11,268 --> 00:57:14,750
the grocery store, even though it's a 45 minutes walk for her,

893
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,034
it would end up being a four

894
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:21,122
hour transit time because she needed to wait for the train.

895
00:57:21,256 --> 00:57:24,846
Thank you, Miranda. Move on. Thank you. Ms. Miranda. Council member

896
00:57:24,878 --> 00:57:28,226
Gallegos would like to respond. Thank you,

897
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:32,190
chair. Ms. Minonda, you had mentioned that you

898
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,014
were hoping that we could have some kind of signs or something to let people

899
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:38,102
know that there's a train, therefore they don't spend their time going to that

900
00:57:38,156 --> 00:57:41,846
crossing. I know that the public works has reached out

901
00:57:41,868 --> 00:57:45,306
to my office and they are working on

902
00:57:45,488 --> 00:57:49,750
some digital boards. I believe there's one going up at Lawndale near Griggs.

903
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:53,134
I believe there's one on Wayside, and I'm not sure where the other

904
00:57:53,172 --> 00:57:57,054
1 may go, but hopefully in the near future,

905
00:57:57,252 --> 00:58:00,682
that will be tied into the Smart railroad crossing.

906
00:58:00,826 --> 00:58:04,478
So that way it lets the drivers know that there's a

907
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:08,130
train, for example, at the 5200 block of Lawndale, and therefore the

908
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,218
driver doesn't have to spend their time going over there to find out there's a

909
00:58:11,224 --> 00:58:14,180
train blocking the crossing. Thank you.

910
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:18,200
Thanks again, Ms. Miranda, for being with us. And thank you for your question.

911
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,738
Next, we'll hear from Mr. Brandon Martindale,

912
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:24,390
who's with us virtually.

913
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:31,122
Or are you here in person? Mr. Martindale,

914
00:58:31,186 --> 00:58:35,018
we've got you as being with us present, but I do not see you

915
00:58:35,104 --> 00:58:38,298
take a second to look for you again. No.

916
00:58:38,384 --> 00:58:42,310
And we'll go on to the next speaker, Mr. Kyle Rogers,

917
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:45,866
online. Mr. Rogers, can you

918
00:58:45,968 --> 00:58:49,260
speak up or hit star six to join us?

919
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,060
Hearing none, looking online.

920
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:00,142
We'll call you again, Mr. Kyle Rogers virtually

921
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:05,010
with us, otherwise proceeding next to Sarah Gutierrez.

922
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,390
Ms. Gutierrez with us online,

923
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:12,246
presumably, if you can hit star six

924
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:13,720
or speak up.

925
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,846
It's been a long meeting. Folks may be getting some lunch. Ms.

926
00:59:19,878 --> 00:59:22,060
Gutierrez, last call for you.

927
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:27,210
Otherwise, we'll move on to

928
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,134
Ms. Virginia Ivanias. Ms.

929
00:59:30,182 --> 00:59:33,930
Ivanyez, if you are with us virtually,

930
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,254
we'll take a moment to hear from you or hit star six if you can

931
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:41,966
unmute and we're not seeing you online.

932
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:45,394
Can you hear me? This is Kyle Rogers. I'm sorry,

933
00:59:45,432 --> 00:59:48,866
go ahead. Kyle Rogers with us. Thank you, Kyle, for joining. We can hear you.

934
00:59:48,888 --> 00:59:51,794
Why don't you go ahead? Okay,

935
00:59:51,912 --> 00:59:55,634
thank you. Hello. At a recent three

936
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:58,866
day NTSB national Transportation Safety

937
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:02,882
Board hearing on rail inefficiency, a former BNSF

938
01:00:02,946 --> 01:00:06,790
supervisor stated that BNSF utilizes public

939
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,438
crossings as parking lots because its acceptable train lengths

940
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:12,490
exceed rail yard capacity.

941
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,514
Should public streets be used as de facto yards? I would

942
01:00:17,552 --> 01:00:21,274
say no. But I want to know what does BNSF think?

943
01:00:21,392 --> 01:00:24,634
What does up think? What does the FRA

944
01:00:24,682 --> 01:00:28,842
think? What is an internally

945
01:00:28,906 --> 01:00:32,906
acceptable stoppage time for a train to be blocking an upgrade

946
01:00:33,098 --> 01:00:37,170
track crossing? Is it 30 minutes, 60 minutes?

947
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,740
120?

948
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,974
What are the reasons for the frequent blockages near BNSF

949
01:00:45,022 --> 01:00:48,310
south yard, nearby telephone Lawndale and Polk

950
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:52,322
to up? What are the reasons for the frequent blockages

951
01:00:52,386 --> 01:00:56,630
at the Galveston sub between Milby and Altic? Is it train length?

952
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,914
What investments or operational changes is BNSF

953
01:01:00,962 --> 01:01:04,666
and up are making to reduce those blockages? We need

954
01:01:04,688 --> 01:01:08,886
to know this. As of the last available data, trains are stopping

955
01:01:08,918 --> 01:01:12,570
for over an hour on average, at the Galveston subline.

956
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:18,650
We want to work together with the city, federal regulators and railroads.

957
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:22,286
We have data. We can give you this data. But if you would

958
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:25,538
like something in return but we would like something in return.

959
01:01:25,624 --> 01:01:29,106
We want minimal blockages. Children are

960
01:01:29,128 --> 01:01:32,546
frequently tardied to school, affecting education. Goods are held up

961
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:36,226
at these blockages, affecting commerce. First responders are

962
01:01:36,248 --> 01:01:40,038
rerouted during emergencies, affecting safety and health.

963
01:01:40,204 --> 01:01:43,702
We urge our rail companies to keep

964
01:01:43,756 --> 01:01:47,746
better blockage data and make it easier for the public to access. We urge

965
01:01:47,778 --> 01:01:51,802
them to drastically improve their operations, especially in the East End.

966
01:01:51,936 --> 01:01:55,958
We urge the federal representatives and regulators to look at how railroads

967
01:01:55,974 --> 01:01:59,670
are operating and change the rules and laws to limit unnecessary,

968
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:03,898
unpredictable, and unprecedented blockages on our streets.

969
01:02:04,074 --> 01:02:08,154
And lastly, we urge our city, county, and state officials

970
01:02:08,202 --> 01:02:11,854
to help catalyze cooperation between us all. To this end,

971
01:02:11,892 --> 01:02:15,134
we encourage any and all funding that will alleviate our

972
01:02:15,172 --> 01:02:18,578
pain and be sought out and applications to be made. Thank you.

973
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:21,886
Thank you, Mr. Rogers. Great question, and I appreciate your willingness

974
01:02:21,918 --> 01:02:25,614
to offer that data. We do have the representative,

975
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:29,266
Ms. Davis from BNSF, responding to your question. Ms.

976
01:02:29,298 --> 01:02:30,070
Davis.

977
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,790
Sir, thank you very much for sharing.

978
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:40,246
Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very

979
01:02:40,268 --> 01:02:43,714
much for sharing your concerns with us. We most certainly

980
01:02:43,772 --> 01:02:47,334
are trying to move our trains as quickly and safely as we possibly

981
01:02:47,382 --> 01:02:50,874
can through communities when there is an issue. As mentioned before, we try our best.

982
01:02:50,912 --> 01:02:54,638
Our crews work to address those issues

983
01:02:54,724 --> 01:02:57,242
and resume the movement of our trains.

984
01:02:57,386 --> 01:03:01,162
So we'll certainly take your concerns back and talk to our operations

985
01:03:01,226 --> 01:03:05,454
team and also work with Union Pacific to work

986
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:08,546
on that coordination and that handoff of our trains going in and out of our

987
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:11,780
yard as well. As I mentioned in my presentation before,

988
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:16,322
communication can always be improved. And so we are committed to both

989
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:19,958
communicating between our crews and our yard, as well as

990
01:03:20,044 --> 01:03:22,550
between up dispatching and our crews.

991
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,502
Thank you, Ms. Davis. I want to thank you, Mr.

992
01:03:26,556 --> 01:03:30,086
Rogers, again, for being here with your question. And I think with

993
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:33,926
that, we'll move on to the next speaker. And I'm told that Mr. Tom Thompson

994
01:03:34,038 --> 01:03:37,446
is with us online. I'm going to try that now. Mr. Thompson,

995
01:03:37,478 --> 01:03:42,734
can you unmute or identify hello.

996
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,840
There he is. All right, sir, go ahead with your question.

997
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:51,134
I'm sorry about the poor reception I have here.

998
01:03:51,332 --> 01:03:54,662
No worries. Go ahead with your question or comment.

999
01:03:54,826 --> 01:03:58,946
Sure. I just wanted to comment in

1000
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:02,558
the presentation from Director Davis and Ms.

1001
01:04:02,574 --> 01:04:06,066
Summerlin, they pointed out some exciting new funding opportunities that

1002
01:04:06,088 --> 01:04:09,474
maybe could be applied for some of the issues we're talking

1003
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:13,442
about here. Of course, it seems that all of them require

1004
01:04:13,506 --> 01:04:17,206
some kind of local match. And that's where it gets tough for us

1005
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,800
because we have limited resources, as we all know.

1006
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:24,154
But several years ago, the voters of Texas approved a

1007
01:04:24,192 --> 01:04:27,770
constitutional amendment that established

1008
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:31,850
a Texas Rail Relocation and Improvement Fund.

1009
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,790
This was back in 2005. Unfortunately, that fund

1010
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:39,086
has never been funded by the legislature. It seems to

1011
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:43,070
me that that could be a source of funding for the kind of projects we're

1012
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:46,754
talking about here that could be used for our

1013
01:04:46,792 --> 01:04:50,130
match to get the federal funding.

1014
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:54,366
And I'm a member of Texas Rail Advocates.

1015
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:58,466
This organization is beginning a campaign now to solicit

1016
01:04:58,498 --> 01:05:02,326
letters of support that can be submitted to the

1017
01:05:02,348 --> 01:05:06,422
Texas State legislature prior to the 2023

1018
01:05:06,476 --> 01:05:10,630
session requesting them to actually allocate funding to the Texas

1019
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:14,474
Rail Relocation and Improvement Fund. And I will be following up with

1020
01:05:14,512 --> 01:05:17,420
emails to the council members with more information.

1021
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,554
Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Thompson, for making it to us

1022
01:05:22,592 --> 01:05:26,240
and for adding your comment for the public record. Thanks very much.

1023
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,634
Thank you. Proceeding with our next speaker, I'm going to call again briefly,

1024
01:05:30,682 --> 01:05:33,920
virginia Yvonnez, who I don't believe is with us.

1025
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:38,050
And following that call is one now for

1026
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,050
Batiri Bankston, who I believe is with us virtually.

1027
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:44,930
Batiri Bankston,

1028
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:52,114
we're looking for phone number and seeing none.

1029
01:05:52,242 --> 01:05:55,430
If you're there, hit star six

1030
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,286
or identify otherwise. Moving on then to our

1031
01:05:59,308 --> 01:06:02,758
next speaker is Mr. James Ganarelli. Mr.

1032
01:06:02,844 --> 01:06:06,538
Gonorelli virtually with us. If you

1033
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:10,250
can speak up or hit star six to unmute

1034
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:15,280
join us with your who do we have?

1035
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:19,470
This is James gunrelli. Okay. Go ahead, Mr.

1036
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:23,246
Gunrelli. Go ahead. Thank you, chair. Thanks for allowing me

1037
01:06:23,268 --> 01:06:26,942
to speak today. I've lived here for 16

1038
01:06:27,006 --> 01:06:30,882
years in the same house in the Fifth Ward, and I've experienced all

1039
01:06:30,936 --> 01:06:34,526
the issues that everyone else has mentioned from loud

1040
01:06:34,558 --> 01:06:38,414
horns, lots of blockages, being stuck in a triangle

1041
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:41,298
where if you've got one behind you and one in front of you, you can't

1042
01:06:41,314 --> 01:06:45,046
go anywhere. Hour, 30 minutes, delays getting

1043
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:49,270
to work, trying to do things in the evening. I'll submit the

1044
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,886
more details on these intersections and also where 18 wheelers

1045
01:06:52,918 --> 01:06:56,566
are rerouting due to blockages that will shake

1046
01:06:56,598 --> 01:07:00,486
my bed at 530 in the morning. And I'll

1047
01:07:00,518 --> 01:07:03,998
send those for comment. Kind of ad living a little bit here because I

1048
01:07:04,004 --> 01:07:07,534
learned a lot today listening to everybody and I noticed two

1049
01:07:07,572 --> 01:07:10,430
themes that I would hope could be addressed.

1050
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:16,050
One of them is that the onus continues to be on the citizens

1051
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:19,842
to report the blockages through a website, a phone number,

1052
01:07:19,976 --> 01:07:23,394
so many different ways or three

1053
01:07:23,432 --> 01:07:26,942
step process on UP's website. I really then

1054
01:07:27,016 --> 01:07:31,586
with Mr. Bounds in the pilot program noticed

1055
01:07:31,618 --> 01:07:35,654
that more passive gathering of the data continuously real

1056
01:07:35,692 --> 01:07:38,322
time is going to provide much more benefit.

1057
01:07:38,466 --> 01:07:41,962
So the second part of it is there seems

1058
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,546
to be so much request for funding that

1059
01:07:45,568 --> 01:07:49,482
will have to be out there that either comes from federal tax dollars, property tax

1060
01:07:49,536 --> 01:07:52,646
dollars, local match, everything else. And I noticed

1061
01:07:52,678 --> 01:07:55,070
with all those partners that were listed,

1062
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:59,966
we unfortunately didn't see Union Pacific as one

1063
01:07:59,988 --> 01:08:03,246
of them on there. So I would hope that they could be

1064
01:08:03,268 --> 01:08:07,342
a willing partner, especially with as cheap as he said so that we can hopefully

1065
01:08:07,486 --> 01:08:11,266
turn this from not just a pilot program, but more into a

1066
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:15,380
much more continuous one and to touch on what everyone else has said.

1067
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:19,526
I remember in 2007 when Mayor Bill White took

1068
01:08:19,548 --> 01:08:23,382
a helicopter around and spoke about the arrogance of

1069
01:08:23,436 --> 01:08:26,520
the stops trains that were around here.

1070
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:30,854
And since 2007, Union Pacific has spent

1071
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:34,166
$48.2 billion on stock

1072
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:37,834
buyback. Thank you very much Mr. Generally appreciate your comment. Your time has

1073
01:08:37,872 --> 01:08:41,802
expired. Appreciate that point. And with

1074
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:45,854
up here still in the chamber today, I think

1075
01:08:45,892 --> 01:08:49,886
your point is a strong one for how they might continue to

1076
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:53,806
step up or further step up. So I appreciate that comment from

1077
01:08:53,828 --> 01:08:56,820
you for the record today. Thanks again for being here.

1078
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:01,106
And our next speaker on our list will move now to Mr.

1079
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:04,946
Oscar Aguilar, who I believe is with us in

1080
01:09:04,968 --> 01:09:08,600
the chamber. Yes, sir. If you would come forward to the podium and

1081
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,240
state your name for the record, we'd appreciate hearing from you,

1082
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,190
Mr. Aguilar.

1083
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,958
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. Committee members,

1084
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:25,606
I'm Oscar Aguilar, General Counsel for State Senator Carol Alvarado,

1085
01:09:25,638 --> 01:09:28,634
and today I'm here on her behalf and I will be reading a statement from

1086
01:09:28,672 --> 01:09:31,722
her. Dear committee members, as a native of the East End,

1087
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:35,546
I have witnessed firsthand the logical and quality of life issues that

1088
01:09:35,568 --> 01:09:38,734
have resulted from the Blocket crossings in the East End.

1089
01:09:38,852 --> 01:09:42,302
Rail traffic has long kept our communities isolated from each other,

1090
01:09:42,356 --> 01:09:46,278
and as important as rail traffic is, the ability of our community to remain

1091
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:49,774
connected is much more paramount. My district office is located

1092
01:09:49,822 --> 01:09:53,694
at the intersection of Lockwood and Harrisburg alongside a BC

1093
01:09:53,742 --> 01:09:57,634
rail line in the East End. On a weekly basis, trains luggagely move

1094
01:09:57,672 --> 01:10:01,190
through the neighborhood, often stopping and blocking multiple crossings

1095
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:04,994
along the track. Consequently, many of my constituents daily routines

1096
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:08,930
are often thrown off by the extensive weights and unnecessary detours

1097
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:12,602
that these blockages cause. Moreover, first responders often

1098
01:10:12,656 --> 01:10:16,214
drive our office responding to calls for service, only to find block

1099
01:10:16,262 --> 01:10:19,802
crossings putting further distance between them and where they're needed.

1100
01:10:19,936 --> 01:10:22,982
The train disruptions largely affect the communities I represent,

1101
01:10:23,046 --> 01:10:26,506
and I am glad to see the city of Houston is working towards a solution.

1102
01:10:26,618 --> 01:10:30,426
I appreciate the initiative that the Houston City Council is taking to find solution

1103
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:34,314
to this ongoing problem. The Smart Railroad Crossing Monitors pilot

1104
01:10:34,362 --> 01:10:38,334
program includes several BC crossings in my district, and I'm eager to review the

1105
01:10:38,372 --> 01:10:41,838
data that the program will produce. The federal funding solutions discussed

1106
01:10:41,854 --> 01:10:45,586
today are also a. Good step in the right direction. And I look forward to

1107
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:49,074
your input on how state resources can be used to address the issue.

1108
01:10:49,192 --> 01:10:52,646
We must continue the discourse so that rail companies know that

1109
01:10:52,668 --> 01:10:56,646
this is an issue that can no longer be ignored and an issue that

1110
01:10:56,668 --> 01:11:00,834
will take significant action from their part to address. I look forward to our continued

1111
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:04,202
work together to address the transportation and quality of life needs

1112
01:11:04,256 --> 01:11:07,830
of Houston and Senate District Six. Sincerely,

1113
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:11,146
Carol Alvarado, state Senator for District Six. Thank you.

1114
01:11:11,168 --> 01:11:14,382
Thank you very much, Mr. Aguilar, and for the letter that

1115
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:17,966
is here submitted for the record. Thank you to her and for

1116
01:11:17,988 --> 01:11:21,882
her involvement as a member of the Senate Transportation Committee.

1117
01:11:21,946 --> 01:11:25,906
I know we're very grateful for her service and for yours as well.

1118
01:11:26,008 --> 01:11:29,106
Council Member Gallegos. Thank you, Chair. Thank you,

1119
01:11:29,128 --> 01:11:32,606
Mr. Aguilar. And also thank Senator

1120
01:11:32,638 --> 01:11:36,498
Alvarado for the letter and for her support in our

1121
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:39,890
efforts to address this issue. Thank you.

1122
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,366
Thank you. Council member. Thank you, Chairman. Yes, sir. And thanks for getting that

1123
01:11:43,388 --> 01:11:47,858
onto the record. Returning now for a moment to our speaker. We understand Batiri

1124
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:50,946
Bankson is with us online. Ms.

1125
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:51,910
Bankson,

1126
01:11:57,350 --> 01:12:01,670
Batiri Bankston told

1127
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:05,190
that you're with us online. If not, we will proceed.

1128
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:08,890
Hit star Six or let us know you're there.

1129
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,666
Otherwise we'll move on in the chamber. I believe with us

1130
01:12:12,688 --> 01:12:16,202
is Mr. Tony Garcia. Mr.

1131
01:12:16,256 --> 01:12:19,754
Garcia is here with us. If you'll come forward and identify

1132
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:23,594
yourself, we'd love to hear your comment or question for the committees

1133
01:12:23,642 --> 01:12:26,670
assembled today. Thank you, Mr. Garcia.

1134
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:31,326
Thank you, Chair Robinson. Thank you, Chair Gagos. So for those

1135
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,878
of you that don't know me, I'm Tony Garcia. I'm a local East End resident.

1136
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:39,346
I'm a businessman, community leader, philanthropist, and all around just

1137
01:12:39,528 --> 01:12:43,246
community servant. As I was here in this meeting

1138
01:12:43,278 --> 01:12:46,770
today, I was just blown away by the things that I've been hearing.

1139
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:50,386
And I just want to give you my point of view. From my perspective,

1140
01:12:50,498 --> 01:12:54,034
the number ten comes to mind, and that is my everyday

1141
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:57,126
task. It's ten. It's ten railroad crossings that are

1142
01:12:57,148 --> 01:13:00,746
blocked while I'm trying to access my child, to get

1143
01:13:00,768 --> 01:13:04,218
them to school, to see my mother, who is a grandmother and an

1144
01:13:04,224 --> 01:13:07,402
elderly woman, reporting to my office,

1145
01:13:07,536 --> 01:13:11,402
reporting to several of my businesses and reporting to my cafe.

1146
01:13:11,546 --> 01:13:15,566
Ten crossings every day that are blocked in

1147
01:13:15,588 --> 01:13:18,250
the East End. Resident that's Lawndale.

1148
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:21,902
Leland Lockwood. Milby Oakhurst.

1149
01:13:22,046 --> 01:13:24,850
Polk. Scott samson,

1150
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:29,758
Ernestine. And if I missed a few, my apologies.

1151
01:13:29,934 --> 01:13:33,426
This just has to stop. I do business elsewhere in

1152
01:13:33,448 --> 01:13:37,186
Houston and throughout Texas. And I can share with you that I don't encounter

1153
01:13:37,218 --> 01:13:40,998
ten blockings anywhere in Houston other than the East End. So at

1154
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:44,454
what point did our lives become less valuable? At what point

1155
01:13:44,492 --> 01:13:48,390
did the city say it's okay for up and BNSF

1156
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:52,634
to just park your trains on our tracks? This must stop now.

1157
01:13:52,832 --> 01:13:56,186
I heard earlier about detections and cameras and

1158
01:13:56,368 --> 01:13:59,878
quiet zones and how they know how they can detect when they're

1159
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:03,662
approaching a quiet zone. Well, clearly an engineer is

1160
01:14:03,716 --> 01:14:07,786
certain he's blocking a track. They know what they're doing. And I can't

1161
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:11,122
imagine that it's anything from mechanical failure when it happens

1162
01:14:11,176 --> 01:14:15,358
on a routine basis. Every single day they deliberately

1163
01:14:15,454 --> 01:14:19,134
block our tracks. It's hindering

1164
01:14:19,182 --> 01:14:22,318
our quality of life. It's a safety hazard.

1165
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:26,546
It's as if every single day we parked a train outside

1166
01:14:26,648 --> 01:14:30,086
your home, BNSF and up, and said, you can't get out, you can't go

1167
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:33,766
to the hospital, you can't take your child to school. We're just

1168
01:14:33,788 --> 01:14:35,800
going to park a track outside your house.

1169
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:40,886
That's all I have. My name is Tony Garcia, and I thank

1170
01:14:40,908 --> 01:14:44,154
you for the time. Well, thank you, Mr. Garcia, for paying attention and for being

1171
01:14:44,192 --> 01:14:47,146
with us. Council Member Gallegos would like to address you. Thank you,

1172
01:14:47,168 --> 01:14:49,978
Chair. And thank you, Tony, for your time, for being here. I know you're a

1173
01:14:49,984 --> 01:14:53,566
busy man, and I know you are very active in the East End, so thank

1174
01:14:53,588 --> 01:14:56,986
you for everything you do for our communities in the East

1175
01:14:57,018 --> 01:15:00,202
End. And like you stated, Leland,

1176
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:03,186
I know you have one of your offices there on Leland, just a block or

1177
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:06,990
so away from the railroad track. So I can only imagine the frustration

1178
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:10,962
that you and your employees go through not able

1179
01:15:11,016 --> 01:15:13,890
to get across that railroad track.

1180
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,094
So, again, thank you for everything that you do. Thank you. Mr.

1181
01:15:17,132 --> 01:15:20,850
Garcia, if you would entertain one comment from Chair.

1182
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:24,198
I know Council Member Gallegos and I were recently at

1183
01:15:24,204 --> 01:15:28,134
the botanical Garden, or right adjacent to it for a track completion

1184
01:15:28,182 --> 01:15:31,850
for part of our pedestrian and rail. And I rode my bike back

1185
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,834
from there and was through your neighborhood and witnessed myself a

1186
01:15:35,872 --> 01:15:39,450
number of blocked intersections. And I know from

1187
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,134
my route that I've got an app on my phone where I know exactly where

1188
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:47,498
I went on that bike ride that day. And with your ten crossings,

1189
01:15:47,594 --> 01:15:51,130
I wonder if you know such an app that you could map your daily route.

1190
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:55,454
Because what you just described to me is not only compromise

1191
01:15:55,502 --> 01:16:00,206
of your personal quality of life, but one that also is representing

1192
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:04,114
what we're here fundamentally for today, which is public safety and the concerns that,

1193
01:16:04,152 --> 01:16:08,146
among others, chief Pena described. So I would love to see what

1194
01:16:08,168 --> 01:16:11,618
you described mapped. And if you need any help, let me know and I'll loan

1195
01:16:11,634 --> 01:16:14,946
you mine. I appreciate that, and I will be certain to map

1196
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:18,026
it out for you and convey it to your office. Okay? Thank you for your

1197
01:16:18,048 --> 01:16:21,722
time. Thank you, Mr. Ricarcia. Thank you, Council. Okay, our next

1198
01:16:21,776 --> 01:16:25,350
speaker is with us online and virtually.

1199
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:29,342
I believe that's Mr. Andrew Wright, if you're with us, hit star

1200
01:16:29,396 --> 01:16:32,782
six or speak up

1201
01:16:32,836 --> 01:16:37,258
and we can hear you now. Mr. Andrew Wright,

1202
01:16:37,354 --> 01:16:38,720
are you still with us?

1203
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:46,668
Okay, we're hearing from Ms. Virginia Ivanyez,

1204
01:16:46,704 --> 01:16:50,216
who we think is online. If you're able to speak. We'd love

1205
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:54,424
to hear from you. Ms. Ivanyez hit

1206
01:16:54,462 --> 01:16:56,300
star six to unmute.

1207
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,772
Not hearing you. We're going to move on. I do see Mr.

1208
01:17:03,826 --> 01:17:07,324
Mark Klein with us in chambers. So let's move to your

1209
01:17:07,362 --> 01:17:10,496
comment. Mr. Klein, I believe you're on

1210
01:17:10,518 --> 01:17:12,850
the north side. I am, thank you.

1211
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:18,028
If you could. Chair Althorn and Chair Geigos and Chair

1212
01:17:18,044 --> 01:17:21,984
Robinson. I appreciate it. I'm Mark Klein, president of Super Neighborhood Twelve,

1213
01:17:22,102 --> 01:17:25,348
and I've been working on the 34th street quiet zone since 2010.

1214
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:28,996
And we've worked really long and hard. Thousands of

1215
01:17:29,018 --> 01:17:32,512
residents support it. It was a crushing blow when, in 2011,

1216
01:17:32,576 --> 01:17:36,580
the funding mechanism, which was rebuilt, Houston passed, and so the funding mechanism

1217
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:40,264
for quiet zones went away. And so we spent the next seven years,

1218
01:17:40,302 --> 01:17:44,804
or at least I did, talking with Public Works jeffrey Weatherford, harry Hayes,

1219
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:48,376
ellen Cohen, formerly City Council, District C,

1220
01:17:48,478 --> 01:17:51,820
and others. And we're told that there just wasn't any money

1221
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:55,372
and that we'd have to find skin in the game to get the city

1222
01:17:55,426 --> 01:17:59,004
council to pony up its share. And I understand that. But the amount of money

1223
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:01,410
we were talking about at the time, half million dollars,

1224
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:05,488
that would be a momentous undertaking for any nonprofit to take,

1225
01:18:05,574 --> 01:18:09,136
let alone a bunch of volunteers. And so we were 9th on the

1226
01:18:09,158 --> 01:18:12,752
list when that list, eight of us, got completed. So when that list went away,

1227
01:18:12,806 --> 01:18:16,368
this is a list that had been vetted by council, by staff,

1228
01:18:16,464 --> 01:18:19,504
and then all of a sudden, we are facing that this has been reshuffled.

1229
01:18:19,552 --> 01:18:22,708
And now 34th street quiet zone could be anywhere on the list. And I just

1230
01:18:22,714 --> 01:18:26,436
want to make sure that it remains top of mind for you folks

1231
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:30,120
and City Council, we're talking about the largest quiet zone that would

1232
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:33,588
occur in Houston. It would impact thousands of residents.

1233
01:18:33,684 --> 01:18:37,372
It would improve the safety for their elementary schools, high three

1234
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:40,924
high schools, the YMCAs on it. There are

1235
01:18:40,962 --> 01:18:44,216
affordable housing, apartment complexes on it. And most importantly,

1236
01:18:44,248 --> 01:18:48,028
there's an underserved community that has probably been underserved since it was formed in

1237
01:18:48,034 --> 01:18:51,792
1915. And that's Independence Heights. And this could be a huge

1238
01:18:51,846 --> 01:18:55,024
improvement for them. And they just built that new high school, burke or two.

1239
01:18:55,062 --> 01:18:58,496
Washington. It's an amazing thing, and I want to say that

1240
01:18:58,598 --> 01:19:02,832
I'm always confounded by Burlington Northern that

1241
01:19:02,886 --> 01:19:06,448
doesn't necessarily pay or contribute for some of these improvements.

1242
01:19:06,544 --> 01:19:09,396
No one's asking anybody to pay the full amount of this,

1243
01:19:09,498 --> 01:19:12,916
but they did make $7 billion in profits last year. And though some

1244
01:19:12,938 --> 01:19:16,280
of those profits are born on the backs of residents living along

1245
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:19,668
these lines that suffer from the consequences of noise pollution,

1246
01:19:19,844 --> 01:19:23,268
which research has shown to be as egregious as air pollution,

1247
01:19:23,364 --> 01:19:27,368
but none of those costs are baked into those profits. And so this

1248
01:19:27,374 --> 01:19:31,324
is an opportunity for a brand to really get out ahead of itself and to

1249
01:19:31,442 --> 01:19:34,748
not only help its shareholders, but to help stakeholders in the community

1250
01:19:34,834 --> 01:19:38,604
improve their lives, improve their quality of life. I've seen firsthand what

1251
01:19:38,642 --> 01:19:42,032
noise pollution and the train horn can do. And so this is a great opportunity

1252
01:19:42,086 --> 01:19:45,456
for BNSF to improve life for thousands of Houstonians and

1253
01:19:45,478 --> 01:19:49,184
for city council as well. Thank you, Mr. Klein. Thank you very much for being

1254
01:19:49,222 --> 01:19:52,644
with us and your appeal to the industry. We appreciate that very

1255
01:19:52,682 --> 01:19:56,304
much. A few more speakers on our list. We will proceed

1256
01:19:56,352 --> 01:19:59,840
with virtually with Ms. Ruby Thomas.

1257
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,688
Ms. Thomas, if you're with us at star six or

1258
01:20:03,854 --> 01:20:07,080
start talking, ms. Thomas,

1259
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:10,810
Ruby Thomas looking for you online, star six.

1260
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:14,260
Otherwise we will move on. Our next speaker is Ms.

1261
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:18,184
Paulette Kukuk in the chamber

1262
01:20:18,232 --> 01:20:21,564
today. Ms. Kukuk, glad you're with us.

1263
01:20:21,762 --> 01:20:25,404
If you could take the podium and state

1264
01:20:25,442 --> 01:20:28,796
your name for the record. Congratulations for saying my

1265
01:20:28,818 --> 01:20:32,048
name correctly. Well, it's very difficult.

1266
01:20:32,214 --> 01:20:35,376
Hello, I'm Paulette Kakuk. I am a director with the

1267
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:39,264
Eastwood Civic Association, and I would like to share some

1268
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:43,232
information in regard to the intersections blocked on the Galveston

1269
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:46,432
sub as a result of stop trains.

1270
01:20:46,576 --> 01:20:49,856
This data was collected by a surveillance camera directed

1271
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:53,960
at the crossing at Eastwood dot number 85

1272
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:57,864
95 22 y. In March of

1273
01:20:57,902 --> 01:21:01,796
2021, 218 trains traveled

1274
01:21:01,828 --> 01:21:05,588
this crossing, of which 26 stopped and blocked

1275
01:21:05,604 --> 01:21:08,430
the intersection for a total of 20 hours.

1276
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,372
In March of 2022, we saw 188

1277
01:21:13,426 --> 01:21:17,400
trains travel this crossing, of which 63

1278
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:21,648
stopped and blocked the intersection for a total of 73 hours

1279
01:21:21,734 --> 01:21:25,740
of blockages. That's 30 less trains,

1280
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:29,760
but 37 more blockages and 52

1281
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:33,936
more hours in a year to year comparison.

1282
01:21:34,128 --> 01:21:37,520
This illustrates that this problem is getting much worse.

1283
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:41,476
Despite fewer trains traveling the track for the

1284
01:21:41,498 --> 01:21:45,224
last six months. I've painstakingly recorded the

1285
01:21:45,262 --> 01:21:49,176
details of every train that's traveled this crossing. Here's what

1286
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:53,524
we learned. We see an average of 163 trains

1287
01:21:53,572 --> 01:21:55,916
a month. Of those,

1288
01:21:56,018 --> 01:22:00,136
34% of them come to a complete stop and block

1289
01:22:00,168 --> 01:22:02,350
the road for at least ten minutes.

1290
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,620
The average duration of the blockage is 62

1291
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:09,648
minutes. Each month,

1292
01:22:09,734 --> 01:22:13,136
this crossing is blocked for a total of 56 hours.

1293
01:22:13,238 --> 01:22:16,944
On average, the longest single blockage was

1294
01:22:16,982 --> 01:22:20,512
8 hours and 38 minutes. We see at least

1295
01:22:20,566 --> 01:22:23,510
one blockage of over 3 hours every month.

1296
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:27,536
This is just a snapshot of what it looks like in the East

1297
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:31,572
End. This is a single crossing on a single rail line.

1298
01:22:31,706 --> 01:22:35,768
The impacts are similar at other crossings on other

1299
01:22:35,854 --> 01:22:39,224
lines. We need the city to accelerate and

1300
01:22:39,262 --> 01:22:42,840
expand its smart railroad crossing. Monitor pilot.

1301
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,664
I would like to ask council and staff, are there

1302
01:22:46,702 --> 01:22:50,824
plans to regularly share the data from the pilot publicly?

1303
01:22:50,952 --> 01:22:54,088
Thank you very much for your time. Well, thank you very much, Ms.

1304
01:22:54,104 --> 01:22:57,804
Kokokin. I think the intention is very much to share that

1305
01:22:57,922 --> 01:23:01,872
data. How we do that? I think we're taking

1306
01:23:01,926 --> 01:23:04,576
a good look at it with the partners who've presented today.

1307
01:23:04,678 --> 01:23:08,396
And I do see Mr. Hannigraff behind you, who presented

1308
01:23:08,428 --> 01:23:10,560
earlier, who may like to approach.

1309
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:16,550
Can you please come forward, mr. Hannigraff, if you'd like to be

1310
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,796
on the record with your comment or response? No, I've been

1311
01:23:21,818 --> 01:23:25,384
working really closely with the East End community and they have been providing us

1312
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:29,032
the data to help us compile the entire story along

1313
01:23:29,086 --> 01:23:32,696
with our sensors. Excellent. And we know the concentration of

1314
01:23:32,798 --> 01:23:36,468
railroad crossings in the East End, the triangle that Council

1315
01:23:36,484 --> 01:23:39,864
Member Gallegos has been speaking of today. So we're grateful

1316
01:23:39,912 --> 01:23:43,036
for your data collection, your observations, and for working with our

1317
01:23:43,058 --> 01:23:45,230
team. Thank you very much. Thank you.

1318
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,950
We do. Miss Kakuk, if you'd hold on, council Member Gallegos would like to

1319
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,876
speak. Go ahead, sir. Thank you. Thank you, chair paulette,

1320
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:58,256
if there was an East End award, you'd be the recipient of

1321
01:23:58,278 --> 01:24:01,888
the East End award for 2022. Can you please share

1322
01:24:01,974 --> 01:24:05,684
how you gathered all this information? Yes, I'd be glad to.

1323
01:24:05,802 --> 01:24:09,140
I bought a Wise camera for $30.

1324
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:12,744
I mounted it at the back of the house because the train track is right

1325
01:24:12,782 --> 01:24:16,824
behind our house. And each day I look at

1326
01:24:16,862 --> 01:24:20,312
the data that's collected from the camera and

1327
01:24:20,446 --> 01:24:23,976
it records for 24 hours. I painstakingly look

1328
01:24:23,998 --> 01:24:27,324
at each time there is a stop train and how long

1329
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:30,716
it stopped. I record it and I give it to

1330
01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:34,408
Danielle, who converts it into a chart.

1331
01:24:34,584 --> 01:24:37,116
Wow. So thank you.

1332
01:24:37,298 --> 01:24:41,324
Thank you for taking your personal time to do this for our community.

1333
01:24:41,442 --> 01:24:45,376
Thank you. Glad to. Thank you. Thanks. Ms. Cook and I

1334
01:24:45,398 --> 01:24:49,024
had a Lionel train when I was a kid. I want your help building that

1335
01:24:49,062 --> 01:24:52,436
next train set. You all

1336
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:56,164
are awesome. We may be down to our final speaker on the list

1337
01:24:56,282 --> 01:24:59,232
before we call anyone who we've missed. Ms.

1338
01:24:59,296 --> 01:25:02,900
Melissa Bealer, I believe you're with us virtually.

1339
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:11,000
Ms. Bealer, if you could hit star six or unmute going

1340
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:14,596
once, going twice, and ask again for Ms.

1341
01:25:14,628 --> 01:25:18,172
Bealer to unmute or speak now

1342
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:22,520
and hearing nothing there, I'm going to call any of those who may have missed.

1343
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,020
And thank you,

1344
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:28,832
Chief. My chief of staff has done an

1345
01:25:28,886 --> 01:25:32,428
incredible job. I want to thank Diana Caisedo,

1346
01:25:32,524 --> 01:25:36,512
as well as Daniel from Council Member Gallegas's office,

1347
01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:40,128
as well as Jordan from Council Member Alcorn's office, and the rest of

1348
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:44,256
our staff. You all are doing great work for us. Thank you so much.

1349
01:25:44,438 --> 01:25:48,464
And we have been passed to two speakers who are with us in Chambers late

1350
01:25:48,512 --> 01:25:52,112
editions. But we do want to hear from everyone. Mr. John Segovia.

1351
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,250
Mr. Segovia, if you're with us,

1352
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:58,936
please state your name for the record.

1353
01:25:59,038 --> 01:26:02,312
And thank you for being here. Good morning,

1354
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:05,896
Council. If it's still morning. It's not, but good

1355
01:26:05,918 --> 01:26:09,592
afternoon. My name is John Paul Segovia.

1356
01:26:09,656 --> 01:26:13,576
I open up an hello? If you could hold on speaker,

1357
01:26:13,608 --> 01:26:17,180
we'll take one more call in a moment, but Mr. Segovia, go ahead.

1358
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:20,764
Thank you. My name is John Paul Segovia. I opened up an art gallery

1359
01:26:20,812 --> 01:26:24,496
in the East End about three years ago and it

1360
01:26:24,518 --> 01:26:28,188
sits in between five train tracks on Samson and Rusk.

1361
01:26:28,364 --> 01:26:31,744
So being there every day

1362
01:26:31,782 --> 01:26:35,088
for the last three years, I get to witness this firsthand

1363
01:26:35,184 --> 01:26:38,756
every day. So it's hard for my clients to get to appointments because

1364
01:26:38,778 --> 01:26:42,196
of daily train blockage. The biggest thing here

1365
01:26:42,218 --> 01:26:45,636
is the train horn abuse. Train conductors

1366
01:26:45,668 --> 01:26:50,136
will blare their horn for minutes at a time and it's very

1367
01:26:50,318 --> 01:26:54,216
annoying if you're trying to host an event there. You get

1368
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:57,748
trains on both sides coming in and it's just a constant blare.

1369
01:26:57,844 --> 01:27:01,288
If there's trains parked on the track, then future trains

1370
01:27:01,304 --> 01:27:04,636
will come through there and still continue to blare their horn. So it's like,

1371
01:27:04,658 --> 01:27:08,256
who are they warning at that point if there's already trains blocking that

1372
01:27:08,278 --> 01:27:11,824
area? So when can we

1373
01:27:11,862 --> 01:27:14,912
expect the quiet zones to take place? Right?

1374
01:27:14,966 --> 01:27:17,250
I hear everybody talking about this,

1375
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:21,024
but really, how hard is it to implement this?

1376
01:27:21,062 --> 01:27:24,852
Why is there talk about all this budget and cost and cost

1377
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:28,448
effectiveness and all this? A human knows

1378
01:27:28,464 --> 01:27:32,132
how to blow a horn, why is there money behind it? Right? So just

1379
01:27:32,186 --> 01:27:33,210
educate them.

1380
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:39,732
I've taken pics and videos of being blocked completely on both sides

1381
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:43,636
and there is a housing development next door that is the Samsung

1382
01:27:43,668 --> 01:27:47,108
Lofts. And so if I'm blocked in as a business and they're blocked

1383
01:27:47,124 --> 01:27:51,036
in at their homes if anything were to happen, I know

1384
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:54,524
there's a chemical company that works next door. If that something were to happen,

1385
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:57,070
catch on fire, we have no place to go.

1386
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,328
And listening to the Fire in Chief expresses the concerns of

1387
01:28:01,414 --> 01:28:05,404
being alert of train blockage made me realize this Uber

1388
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:08,656
technology has been around for twelve years now, and I work for

1389
01:28:08,678 --> 01:28:12,492
a logistics company who has adopted this technology back in 2015

1390
01:28:12,566 --> 01:28:15,760
to monitor the driving routes of their trash trucks.

1391
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,264
Why is it taking the Railroad Commission so long to implement

1392
01:28:19,312 --> 01:28:22,388
this technology? And you spoke about an app that

1393
01:28:22,394 --> 01:28:25,944
you have on your phone and you're going to pass that information to my friend

1394
01:28:25,982 --> 01:28:29,156
Tony Garcia. And why isn't the Royal Commission

1395
01:28:29,188 --> 01:28:32,840
adopting this technology? Alerting the Fire Chief

1396
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:37,064
of train blockage. Thank you Mr. Segovia. And you have been joined

1397
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:40,636
at the podium from Ms. Davis, from the city. Ms. Davis, if you'd like to

1398
01:28:40,658 --> 01:28:41,340
respond.

1399
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,276
Okay, so as far as quiet zones go,

1400
01:28:47,378 --> 01:28:49,330
as the previous speaker mentioned,

1401
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,804
priorities change and this is prior to me taking this role.

1402
01:28:53,852 --> 01:28:57,296
And so we have added more signature programs like the

1403
01:28:57,318 --> 01:29:00,576
Mayor Street Rehab Initiative to which we

1404
01:29:00,678 --> 01:29:04,404
aim to redo 2% of our roads every

1405
01:29:04,442 --> 01:29:08,436
year. We work very closely with the council members, the district council members on

1406
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:12,132
that. So since coming into this role, we have been moving

1407
01:29:12,186 --> 01:29:15,700
some funding to the quiet zones. But there's a two part

1408
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:19,336
effort. So there's the part on the city where we have

1409
01:29:19,358 --> 01:29:23,364
the five that we have right now that are pending, where we're doing our portion

1410
01:29:23,412 --> 01:29:27,756
of that, whether it's upgrading the

1411
01:29:27,778 --> 01:29:31,356
pavement markings or the channelization for

1412
01:29:31,378 --> 01:29:34,684
the cars. So that is something that we do on our side.

1413
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:38,428
But it is an effort when we do the quiet zones, because there

1414
01:29:38,434 --> 01:29:41,292
are times when there are things that need to happen on the rail side,

1415
01:29:41,346 --> 01:29:44,976
and we can't compel them to do it, but we do partner with

1416
01:29:44,998 --> 01:29:48,288
them on quiet zones. And so that's just generally what can take so long.

1417
01:29:48,454 --> 01:29:52,016
And so I do have a staff person. Part of their role is quiet

1418
01:29:52,048 --> 01:29:55,604
zones and part is school zones, but we are

1419
01:29:55,642 --> 01:29:58,180
moving forward with the ones that are pending.

1420
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:02,964
Thank you for that discussion and explanation. We appreciate that.

1421
01:30:03,002 --> 01:30:06,160
And without any comments or

1422
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,130
council members in the queue, we want to thank you for being here today.

1423
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:13,176
I didn't see that. Council Member Gallegos. Go ahead. Thank you,

1424
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:17,176
Chair. Thank you for being here today. I know you were asking about quiet

1425
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:19,230
zones there around Samson and York.

1426
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:24,024
Again, that's where we've submitted to Congresswoman

1427
01:30:24,072 --> 01:30:27,432
Garcia and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for

1428
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:30,832
community project funding for that area

1429
01:30:30,886 --> 01:30:32,960
right in there for a quiet zone.

1430
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:37,970
And it's estimated that it will cost about $3.6 million

1431
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:42,096
to convert those crossings right in there into a quiet

1432
01:30:42,128 --> 01:30:45,940
zone. So I can only ask that you and your neighbors and

1433
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:49,440
businesses in the area please contact Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia,

1434
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,076
congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and let them know that the

1435
01:30:53,098 --> 01:30:56,724
city of Houston has asked for them to secure

1436
01:30:56,772 --> 01:31:01,032
some funding from community project funding, these $3.6 million

1437
01:31:01,086 --> 01:31:04,676
so we can address that. Great. Thank you. Yeah. And then I will add that's

1438
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:08,296
the one of ours that's a priority for grade separation. And so we have

1439
01:31:08,318 --> 01:31:11,916
that. We're at about 30% design. And so those are ones that

1440
01:31:11,938 --> 01:31:15,704
when the notice of funding becomes available, again, depending on the criteria,

1441
01:31:15,752 --> 01:31:19,084
that is one at the top of our list to submit to get the funding

1442
01:31:19,132 --> 01:31:22,556
so that we can close the gap. And the Chair will note

1443
01:31:22,588 --> 01:31:25,970
also that with our partnering with our federal friends,

1444
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,948
the aforementioned Congress folks, Sheila Jackson Lee and

1445
01:31:29,974 --> 01:31:33,744
Sylvia Garcia, with the new return of potential earmarks

1446
01:31:33,792 --> 01:31:37,444
and funding, some things have

1447
01:31:37,482 --> 01:31:41,476
changed with the IIja, and we will continue to pursue every opportunity

1448
01:31:41,578 --> 01:31:45,096
to work with those available funds. So thank you again,

1449
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:48,728
both, and Council member for your response. We're going

1450
01:31:48,734 --> 01:31:53,000
to turn to our final signed up speaker, Mr. Juan Paras.

1451
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:58,556
Did I hear from here he is. Mr. Paras, thank you for

1452
01:31:58,578 --> 01:32:01,836
being here. Coming to

1453
01:32:01,938 --> 01:32:05,390
the podium, if you identify yourself for the record.

1454
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,180
Yes, sir. Thank you. My name is Juan Paras,

1455
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:13,170
and I live in the East End.

1456
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:19,392
Pardon me. Go ahead. Okay. And I live

1457
01:32:19,446 --> 01:32:23,252
almost at the corner of Lockwood and Harrisburg and

1458
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:27,110
Rusk runs parallel to the Harrisburg rail line.

1459
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,704
And I've heard a lot of good issues raised,

1460
01:32:30,752 --> 01:32:34,824
but nobody's raised the issue of why

1461
01:32:34,862 --> 01:32:39,140
don't the railway arts just expand their railway yards facility

1462
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,560
so the trains can have a place to park?

1463
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:45,320
Because they're so often blocking our communities that

1464
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:49,304
I consider that their parking lot, their unofficial parking

1465
01:32:49,352 --> 01:32:52,764
lot. And if they have to pay

1466
01:32:52,802 --> 01:32:56,430
for parking there, I think we would generate a lot of money for the city.

1467
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,636
So that's just another idea. But needless

1468
01:33:00,668 --> 01:33:04,210
to say, this is also an environmental justice issue.

1469
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:08,188
The East End is inundated with environmental justice

1470
01:33:08,284 --> 01:33:12,276
issues, train traffic, 18 wheelers running on

1471
01:33:12,298 --> 01:33:16,164
our streets, and numerous issues

1472
01:33:16,362 --> 01:33:19,476
that impact our communities and standard of living.

1473
01:33:19,658 --> 01:33:23,236
So I would propose that one of the ideas is to

1474
01:33:23,258 --> 01:33:27,016
expand the rail yards or to penalize or

1475
01:33:27,118 --> 01:33:30,184
give fines. Like when you're parking at a meter and it

1476
01:33:30,222 --> 01:33:33,544
expires, you get a penalty, right? You pay a fine.

1477
01:33:33,742 --> 01:33:38,104
If we had something like that, it may encourage the railroad

1478
01:33:38,152 --> 01:33:41,960
industry to expand their rail yards

1479
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:46,456
and accommodate the traffic that's coming into Houston.

1480
01:33:46,568 --> 01:33:50,028
Thank you, Mr. Paris. Thank you. Sounds so sensible and

1481
01:33:50,114 --> 01:33:54,016
easy. I don't know if our chair of the regulatory affairs, who handles all

1482
01:33:54,038 --> 01:33:57,664
parking issues in the ordinance, if you want to think about a levy for

1483
01:33:57,702 --> 01:34:01,076
the train companies. Do we have any interest in responding from

1484
01:34:01,098 --> 01:34:03,728
BNSF or up? Ms.

1485
01:34:03,744 --> 01:34:06,788
Davis or please come forward,

1486
01:34:06,874 --> 01:34:10,212
sir. Thank you for your question. Again,

1487
01:34:10,266 --> 01:34:12,500
for the record, if you could identify yourselves.

1488
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:19,144
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is Tessa Minor from BNSF. I just wanted

1489
01:34:19,182 --> 01:34:22,760
to respond to I'm sorry, I missed his name.

1490
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:25,812
Just wanted to respond, Mr. Paris, mr. Paras,

1491
01:34:25,956 --> 01:34:29,676
I appreciate that. Unfortunately, the railroads were built hundreds of

1492
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:33,000
years ago, and Houston is built at city around the railroads.

1493
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:36,300
And so that limits our capacity to expand our yards.

1494
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:41,696
Okay, there's one answer. How about you, Mr. ZenTek? So,

1495
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:45,296
I would say the capacity projects that I was talking about going on at

1496
01:34:45,318 --> 01:34:48,704
Inglewood, we are looking at what

1497
01:34:48,742 --> 01:34:52,556
improvements can be made, some of which we had talked about earlier, between the signal

1498
01:34:52,588 --> 01:34:56,388
upgrades as well as within the yard itself. So there are those projects that

1499
01:34:56,394 --> 01:34:59,584
we're looking at continuing to make a number of various

1500
01:34:59,632 --> 01:35:03,336
investments within the state of Texas related to our siding projects to be

1501
01:35:03,358 --> 01:35:05,000
able to accommodate the growth.

1502
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:09,684
For the record, are you two and your companies both officially

1503
01:35:09,732 --> 01:35:11,240
against a parking fee?

1504
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:17,432
I believe the fifth no. Yes,

1505
01:35:17,486 --> 01:35:20,936
I'm against it. Jokes aside, appreciate creative solutions,

1506
01:35:20,968 --> 01:35:24,616
and we are looking for ways in which to address these concerns.

1507
01:35:24,648 --> 01:35:27,592
So thank you all again for being here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

1508
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:31,040
Yes, we're now at the end of our list.

1509
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:34,304
We have now a point where we'd like to make a last

1510
01:35:34,342 --> 01:35:36,850
call for those speakers who have not.

1511
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:42,816
Hello? Can you hear me? We are calling for one last round.

1512
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:46,816
Yes, who's on the line, please? Hi, this is Melissa

1513
01:35:46,848 --> 01:35:50,084
Bealer from Air Alliance, Houston. Say your name,

1514
01:35:50,122 --> 01:35:54,040
please, one more time. Melissa Bealer.

1515
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:58,136
Melissa Bealer. Very good. Go ahead with your comment or

1516
01:35:58,158 --> 01:36:01,892
your question. Thank you. Good afternoon,

1517
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:05,530
council members. Again, my name is Melissa and I'm with the

1518
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,224
transportation justice coordinator for air Alliance Houston,

1519
01:36:09,352 --> 01:36:12,588
who envisions healthy communities with clean air

1520
01:36:12,674 --> 01:36:15,964
every day for everyone. I don't want to take up too much time.

1521
01:36:16,002 --> 01:36:19,184
I just want to say that we are in support of our neighbors and our

1522
01:36:19,222 --> 01:36:22,956
community partners in requesting improved conditions

1523
01:36:22,988 --> 01:36:27,088
to rail operations in Houston. We understand

1524
01:36:27,254 --> 01:36:30,704
and also express the same frustrations that the

1525
01:36:30,742 --> 01:36:34,468
community does in terms of the fact that while we are looking at

1526
01:36:34,634 --> 01:36:37,924
solutions today with railroad companies, it's been a long

1527
01:36:37,962 --> 01:36:41,156
time coming. And communities, these are

1528
01:36:41,178 --> 01:36:44,484
the communities that often get the harms as opposed

1529
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:48,676
to the benefits of our transportation system. And there's

1530
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:53,124
definitely some cumulative impact issues compounding

1531
01:36:53,172 --> 01:36:55,480
with pollution from the port and the highways.

1532
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:59,596
Communities are concerned about train pollution while

1533
01:36:59,618 --> 01:37:03,544
idling as well. So that might be something that industry

1534
01:37:03,592 --> 01:37:07,212
could speak to a bit in terms of whether

1535
01:37:07,266 --> 01:37:11,052
or not the best available technology to reduce or eliminate emissions

1536
01:37:11,116 --> 01:37:14,464
while Idling and while we deal with these train blockages are

1537
01:37:14,502 --> 01:37:18,736
in fact happening for Houston. I also wanted to mention my

1538
01:37:18,758 --> 01:37:21,040
own experiences with train blockages,

1539
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:25,204
having visited Magnolia Park when I was working with

1540
01:37:25,242 --> 01:37:28,516
community members to learn more about the improvements that they'd like to see for

1541
01:37:28,538 --> 01:37:32,572
the braze bayou trail. We tried to go visit

1542
01:37:32,736 --> 01:37:36,952
a trailhead, the best trailhead that they can visit at

1543
01:37:37,086 --> 01:37:40,248
capitol street, right behind

1544
01:37:40,334 --> 01:37:43,592
the multi service center there. And a train

1545
01:37:43,646 --> 01:37:47,800
was blocking the trailhead, so we had to go walk to wayside

1546
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:53,048
where it has very narrow sidewalk. It's honestly

1547
01:37:53,144 --> 01:37:56,732
gravel in some places and not a sidewalk. And we're facing three

1548
01:37:56,786 --> 01:37:59,996
lanes of oncoming car traffic. Thank you. Trying to go

1549
01:38:00,018 --> 01:38:04,112
in like a single mile line. Thank you, Ms. Bealer, for your comments today

1550
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:08,112
and for joining us online. Thank you very much. I think

1551
01:38:08,166 --> 01:38:11,776
Ms. Ruby Thomas may be online. We're looking again for Ms.

1552
01:38:11,808 --> 01:38:14,644
Thomas. Ruby, are you there?

1553
01:38:14,682 --> 01:38:17,590
If so, speak up or hit star six.

1554
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,808
I think we're having challenges with getting you online. We're going to call

1555
01:38:25,894 --> 01:38:29,360
one last time for Ms. Virginia Ivanyez.

1556
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:32,530
Understanding you may have joined us back online.

1557
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:45,104
Understand, Ms. Thomas, you may be trying

1558
01:38:45,142 --> 01:38:47,730
to unmute hit star six on your phone.

1559
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:52,576
Speak up. We'd love to hear from you. And if we can't hear

1560
01:38:52,598 --> 01:38:56,016
from you, you can always submit your question to any of the

1561
01:38:56,038 --> 01:38:59,596
chairs who are co sponsoring this meeting. That's council Member Sally

1562
01:38:59,628 --> 01:39:03,356
Alcorn, council Member Robert Gallegos or myself, council Member David

1563
01:39:03,388 --> 01:39:06,290
Robinson. So with that,

1564
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:11,012
I'm going to call for any final speakers.

1565
01:39:11,156 --> 01:39:14,852
Last time for any speakers to hit SAR

1566
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:18,776
six or speak up. I think

1567
01:39:18,798 --> 01:39:21,896
we have come to the end of our time. Council members, I'd like to thank

1568
01:39:21,918 --> 01:39:26,488
you for being here, your staff and all members of the public, both online virtually

1569
01:39:26,584 --> 01:39:29,800
as well as in the chamber. For final comments,

1570
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,940
let me call first on council member Robert Gallegos.

1571
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:37,328
Thank you, chair. I was in the queue. I just wanted to thank

1572
01:39:37,494 --> 01:39:41,136
Mr. Padas for your years of advocacy in

1573
01:39:41,158 --> 01:39:44,704
our community addressing environmental issues. So thank you

1574
01:39:44,742 --> 01:39:47,908
for everything that you do in the community. Let me

1575
01:39:47,914 --> 01:39:51,856
again thank all the public speakers who testified today and shared

1576
01:39:51,888 --> 01:39:55,264
the very serious issues they're seeing and filling

1577
01:39:55,312 --> 01:39:58,900
in our community due to poor rail operations.

1578
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:03,036
As I told up back in January, and I say to be an SF

1579
01:40:03,088 --> 01:40:06,616
today, it is of utmost importance that the

1580
01:40:06,638 --> 01:40:10,312
railroads work collaboratively with cities and communities

1581
01:40:10,376 --> 01:40:14,456
to identify and implement mutual

1582
01:40:14,568 --> 01:40:17,836
beneficial solutions. We can no longer

1583
01:40:17,938 --> 01:40:22,152
accept prolonged blockages lasting four

1584
01:40:22,306 --> 01:40:25,536
and 8 hours and even 14 hours.

1585
01:40:25,638 --> 01:40:29,360
As it was learned today, blocking major

1586
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:33,004
thoroughfares and neighborhood streets leaves residents

1587
01:40:33,052 --> 01:40:37,952
stranded, frustrated, and first responders

1588
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:41,460
must scramble to find alternate, longer routes.

1589
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:46,800
And as we all know, every second counts in emergency

1590
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:50,580
responses. Prolonged blockages

1591
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:54,664
are unacceptable and must be corrected. I ask

1592
01:40:54,702 --> 01:40:58,804
the railroads to please work with us, to remain engaged

1593
01:40:58,932 --> 01:41:01,320
and operate more responsibly.

1594
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:05,732
Finally, let me thank Director Jesse Bounds,

1595
01:41:05,876 --> 01:41:09,096
jack Hanigriff, and all the partners

1596
01:41:09,208 --> 01:41:12,904
recognized earlier for all they've done to get us to this

1597
01:41:12,962 --> 01:41:16,364
point and for working with my office to bring this pilot

1598
01:41:16,412 --> 01:41:19,984
to fruition. I really do appreciate their work

1599
01:41:20,022 --> 01:41:23,344
and dedication. The findings they previewed with us

1600
01:41:23,382 --> 01:41:26,740
today support citizen observations and

1601
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:30,352
complaints about blocked city streets and critical

1602
01:41:30,416 --> 01:41:34,352
crossings. And as we noted, the data gathered

1603
01:41:34,416 --> 01:41:37,590
through this pilot will be utilized to better understand,

1604
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:41,556
manage and control the impacts of block crossings

1605
01:41:41,668 --> 01:41:46,068
and to inform and encourage data driven collaboration

1606
01:41:46,164 --> 01:41:49,876
between communities, federal regulators, and the railroad

1607
01:41:49,908 --> 01:41:53,352
companies. Again, thank you all and let's

1608
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:56,716
all continue to work together. Thank you. Thank you.

1609
01:41:56,738 --> 01:42:00,156
Council Member. Council Member alcorn. Thank you, Chair. And thank you,

1610
01:42:00,178 --> 01:42:03,368
Council Member Gallegos. I certainly can improve on that. What I do want

1611
01:42:03,394 --> 01:42:07,020
to say, what I heard from residents today was about a comprehensive

1612
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:10,672
plan, some kind of knowledge of when

1613
01:42:10,726 --> 01:42:14,336
your grade crossing or your quiet zone might be

1614
01:42:14,438 --> 01:42:17,732
in the queue. So I want to talk more with public Works

1615
01:42:17,786 --> 01:42:22,192
about a comprehensive plan to address these, especially with all these infrastructure

1616
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:25,972
dollars available. Thank you to the railroads for coming. We need you.

1617
01:42:26,106 --> 01:42:29,872
Our city economy, state and national economy need the trains.

1618
01:42:29,936 --> 01:42:33,032
We all just have to figure out how we can better get along and be

1619
01:42:33,086 --> 01:42:36,600
better neighbors. Thank you. Thank you, council member. And again,

1620
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:40,552
thank you to all of our participants today, those who've presented staff

1621
01:42:40,616 --> 01:42:43,916
and council for their support and attendance today, I want

1622
01:42:43,938 --> 01:42:48,328
to remind the public and urge the community to continue reporting

1623
01:42:48,424 --> 01:42:53,180
instances of blocked crossings to www dot FRA

1624
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:58,348
dot gov blockedcrossings,

1625
01:42:58,524 --> 01:43:04,656
and to call Union Pacific at 188-87-7267.

1626
01:43:04,758 --> 01:43:07,916
Want to thank again council members Robert Gallegos and Council Member Sally

1627
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:11,184
Alcorn and their teams for participating with us.

1628
01:43:11,382 --> 01:43:15,024
All of these presentations will be compiled and

1629
01:43:15,062 --> 01:43:18,724
placed online for the public to see in future reference.

1630
01:43:18,772 --> 01:43:22,152
And with that, I want to thank everyone again and. We are

1631
01:43:22,206 --> 01:43:23,160
adjourned.
