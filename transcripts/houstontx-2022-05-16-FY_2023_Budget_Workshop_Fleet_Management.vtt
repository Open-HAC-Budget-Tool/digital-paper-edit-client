WEBVTT

00:01.530 --> 00:04.910
Next we'll have the Office of Fleet Management.

00:08.050 --> 00:11.406
Keep looking around the room for Jack Christie for this one, but I

00:11.428 --> 00:24.670
don't think he's here's.

00:25.370 --> 00:29.010
I'd like to welcome Director Gary Glask

00:29.090 --> 00:32.802
and Mr. Ray Cruz. Good afternoon.

00:32.866 --> 00:36.930
My name is Gary Glaskok, and I'm the director of the Fleet Management Department.

00:37.090 --> 00:40.886
I'll be presenting the department's proposed operating budget for fiscal

00:40.918 --> 00:44.906
year 2023. Along with me is Ray Cruz of the

00:44.928 --> 00:48.326
Finance Department. Ray serves as the Chief

00:48.358 --> 00:51.150
Financial Officer for Fleet Management.

00:51.650 --> 00:52.960
Next slide, please.

00:54.370 --> 00:57.914
I'll start with some department information for reference purposes.

00:58.042 --> 01:02.106
Our mission is to provide the City of Houston with best value fleet

01:02.138 --> 01:05.422
management services. We operate 27 maintenance

01:05.486 --> 01:08.802
garages and 67 refueling sites to service

01:08.856 --> 01:12.766
a little more than 13,700 vehicles and pieces

01:12.798 --> 01:15.060
of equipment. Next slide, please.

01:17.370 --> 01:20.546
Fleet Management is a revolving fund department.

01:20.658 --> 01:24.358
Our proposed operating budget for fiscal year 2023

01:24.444 --> 01:29.580
is $98,930,411.

01:30.350 --> 01:33.994
This budget will provide for a little more than 381

01:34.032 --> 01:37.098
full time positions that are deployed within

01:37.184 --> 01:40.926
five different programs. The first of these programs is

01:40.948 --> 01:45.246
the Director's Office, which handles the strategic planning, policy making

01:45.348 --> 01:49.166
and personnel administration for the department. The budget of the

01:49.188 --> 01:52.754
Director's Office covers restricted account charges by other

01:52.792 --> 01:56.594
city departments, including Human Resources, Finance and

01:56.632 --> 02:01.454
Hits. Our Operation division performs

02:01.502 --> 02:05.038
the maintenance work in the garages and oversees the repair work done

02:05.064 --> 02:08.486
by our contractors. 61% of the

02:08.508 --> 02:12.050
total Fleet Management budget is allocated to the operations

02:12.130 --> 02:15.810
program to cover the cost of labor, spare parts

02:15.890 --> 02:19.606
and contracted services. The Fuel

02:19.638 --> 02:23.494
Management Group oversees fuel, inventories and service station

02:23.542 --> 02:27.142
maintenance. Their budget pays for the gasoline and diesel

02:27.206 --> 02:30.510
used by city vehicles. Our Customer

02:30.580 --> 02:34.554
Service Division handles the distribution of replacement parts, our material

02:34.602 --> 02:38.254
and services contracts, as well as our motor pool or

02:38.292 --> 02:42.058
fleet share. The customer service budget is largely

02:42.154 --> 02:46.126
driven by labor costs. And then finally, our Asset

02:46.158 --> 02:49.438
Management Division oversees capital, program, vehicle,

02:49.534 --> 02:53.202
onboarding tracking and eventual disposal. They also

02:53.256 --> 02:57.474
manage our data collection system as well as our reporting systems.

02:57.602 --> 03:01.634
In addition to labor costs, the asset management budget covers

03:01.682 --> 03:04.914
software, maintenance and related expenses. Next slide,

03:04.962 --> 03:08.694
please. This slide

03:08.742 --> 03:13.014
provides historical reference for our proposed budget and major expense categories.

03:13.142 --> 03:17.046
Again, we are a revolving fund department, so the listed

03:17.078 --> 03:20.550
values reflect both our revenues and expenses.

03:20.710 --> 03:24.810
In the top table, you'll see that we're proposing a $3.9 million

03:24.890 --> 03:28.282
or 4.2% increase in operating expenses

03:28.346 --> 03:31.598
compared to current year. Moving down to

03:31.604 --> 03:35.134
the expense category table, our personnel expenses

03:35.182 --> 03:38.674
are increasing by 3.6%, while the cost of

03:38.712 --> 03:43.140
supplies is going up $1.8 million or 9%.

03:44.150 --> 03:47.966
We're seeing a 1% increase in restricted account charges

03:48.078 --> 03:52.022
as well as an increase of $535,000

03:52.156 --> 03:55.670
for contracted services. And I'll provide a little more detail

03:55.740 --> 03:58.966
on these increases a little later in the presentation. Next slide,

03:58.998 --> 04:02.906
please. Here's a

04:02.928 --> 04:06.326
graphical representation on how the funding of our proposed budget

04:06.358 --> 04:09.946
is being allocated. Labor is the largest slice of

04:09.968 --> 04:13.214
the pie at 37% of total, followed by

04:13.252 --> 04:15.994
fuel at 25% and parts.

04:16.042 --> 04:19.662
At 16%, we plan to spend roughly $9

04:19.716 --> 04:23.682
million on Outsider Contracted Services and

04:23.736 --> 04:26.690
$5.6 million on tires.

04:27.030 --> 04:30.642
The $4.1 million slice of pie labeled Other

04:30.696 --> 04:34.446
Restricted accounts includes what we pay other city departments

04:34.478 --> 04:37.974
for their services. And finally, the 3 million in

04:38.012 --> 04:42.354
the other miscellaneous expenses will fund items such as office supplies,

04:42.482 --> 04:46.994
employee uniforms, diagnostic software and tools.

04:47.122 --> 04:48.460
Next slide, please.

04:51.310 --> 04:55.274
Fleet Management receives revenues from our client departments to

04:55.312 --> 04:58.342
cover their fuel and vehicle maintenance expenses.

04:58.486 --> 05:02.302
Roughly 74 million in revenue will be sourced from the general fund

05:02.356 --> 05:05.646
departments, while 23 million is expected from

05:05.668 --> 05:10.014
the departments that operate with enterprise funds. Another 2.8

05:10.052 --> 05:13.490
million will come from special grants and funds.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.010
Next slide.

05:18.230 --> 05:22.174
This table lists the expenditure changes included in the proposed budget

05:22.222 --> 05:25.134
compared to current year. In the top section of the table,

05:25.182 --> 05:28.470
you'll see that our operating budget for fiscal year 22

05:28.540 --> 05:31.958
is $94.9 million. This amount

05:32.044 --> 05:35.250
includes a $4.6 million adjustment

05:35.330 --> 05:38.170
that was made to cover fuel price increases.

05:39.150 --> 05:42.986
The middle section of the table highlights the significant adjustments of the

05:43.008 --> 05:47.190
proposed fiscal year 23 budget. All of the increases

05:47.270 --> 05:50.830
are limited to contractual or mandated adjustments.

05:51.490 --> 05:55.022
The sum of these adjustments results in the 4.2%

05:55.156 --> 05:58.826
budget increase compared to current year. Next slide,

05:58.858 --> 06:02.174
please. Here's some

06:02.212 --> 06:05.950
additional detail on the budget adjustments of the previous slide.

06:06.110 --> 06:10.930
Personnel costs are going up approximately $997,000

06:11.080 --> 06:14.574
due to the Hope salary increase along with the rising costs

06:14.622 --> 06:18.166
of health and pension benefits. Our headcount for

06:18.188 --> 06:21.794
fiscal year 23 actually drops by three compared

06:21.842 --> 06:25.174
to current year. Fuel expenses go up

06:25.212 --> 06:28.658
$240,000. This increases

06:28.754 --> 06:32.314
on top of the $4.6 million adjustment that was made

06:32.352 --> 06:34.810
to the current year budget for fuel.

06:35.630 --> 06:39.402
A $2 million Escalation for the purchase of parts will cover

06:39.456 --> 06:42.986
rising costs resulting from inflation and supply chain

06:43.018 --> 06:46.554
issues. We're also increasing the cost of contracted

06:46.602 --> 06:49.806
services by $1 million. This adjustment will

06:49.828 --> 06:53.346
handle Escalating contractor rates as well as provide us

06:53.368 --> 06:58.562
with some additional contracting capacity. The $379,000

06:58.616 --> 07:01.838
reduction in program expenses is a sum

07:01.854 --> 07:05.586
of cuts over multiple budget line items as

07:05.608 --> 07:09.026
well as the elimination of onetime expenses that occurred

07:09.058 --> 07:12.434
during the current year. And this concludes

07:12.482 --> 07:16.306
the Fleet Management Fiscal Year 2023 budget presentation.

07:16.418 --> 07:19.878
We've got next slide there, but I think we'll skip over it for the sake

07:19.894 --> 07:22.662
of time. Really isn't related to the budget,

07:22.806 --> 07:26.166
and we'll go to questions. Thank you, Council Member

07:26.198 --> 07:29.258
Ed Pollard. Thank you, Chair. I have a couple of

07:29.264 --> 07:32.778
questions. First one is from Council Member Michael

07:32.794 --> 07:36.830
Kubash, who's not with us at the moment. His question

07:36.900 --> 07:39.870
is how do we purchase gasoline,

07:40.290 --> 07:43.742
diesel and CNG? Do we buy it each

07:43.796 --> 07:46.420
month or is there a contract out for it each year?

07:47.510 --> 07:50.946
We purchase it under contract and we're currently in the

07:50.968 --> 07:54.974
third year of the contract. We've got two one year options that

07:55.032 --> 07:58.754
are available. The current term

07:58.802 --> 08:02.614
ends, I believe it's in September of this year. And that

08:02.652 --> 08:06.662
vendor is for all different types of gasoline. No, we've actually

08:06.716 --> 08:10.474
got one vendor for gasoline and

08:10.512 --> 08:13.450
another vendor for diesel.

08:13.870 --> 08:17.686
And we actually ride the contract that's

08:17.718 --> 08:21.626
owned by Metro. And so Metro's fuel Buying,

08:21.658 --> 08:25.630
in addition to the City's fuel buying, provides us with some purchasing leverage.

08:27.170 --> 08:31.146
Second question is, last year we had a budget amendment

08:31.178 --> 08:34.994
that was put forth that we discussed within BFA that talked

08:35.032 --> 08:39.022
about the idea of putting advertisements

08:39.166 --> 08:43.234
on city vehicles as a way to generate revenue. I knew we were

08:43.352 --> 08:46.674
doing maybe a study or an analysis on whether or not that

08:46.712 --> 08:49.590
is feasible, something that would be attractive to the city.

08:49.740 --> 08:53.586
Are you familiar with that? Where do we stand on that? I was not involved

08:53.618 --> 08:57.842
in those particular discussions, but I can say that at a previous employer,

08:57.906 --> 09:01.354
we did take advantage of that particular opportunity and there

09:01.392 --> 09:05.686
was some revenue that was generated. Of course, this was using transit

09:05.718 --> 09:10.182
buses. So there's a much larger canvas compared to the opportunities

09:10.246 --> 09:14.094
that are provided with city vehicles. Chair, did we ever get any feedback on that

09:14.132 --> 09:18.030
after we did that BFA meeting regarding that topic?

09:18.610 --> 09:22.094
No, not that I recall. Okay, I'll follow up with you on that.

09:22.132 --> 09:25.166
Thank you. This is a quick follow up. The contracts

09:25.198 --> 09:29.182
for the gas, diesel and LNG, are they a fixed price or a variable?

09:29.326 --> 09:32.974
They're variable price and they're based on the Platts marketing

09:33.022 --> 09:36.354
index. And so our price is relative to whatever that

09:36.392 --> 09:40.674
index is doing. So as prices rise we didn't do any hedging.

09:40.802 --> 09:44.454
We did not do any hedging, but we are considering it at the moment.

09:44.652 --> 09:48.454
In fact, we've had some discussions with both our finance group

09:48.492 --> 09:52.266
and legal as well as Metro because they're doing a little hedging right now

09:52.368 --> 09:55.990
to see if we can offer the city some protection going that route.

09:56.150 --> 09:59.526
Council member Amy Peck. Thank you. Thank you, Director,

09:59.558 --> 10:03.498
for the presentation. As costs are increasing

10:03.594 --> 10:07.642
for gas, for just maintenance, for everything related to fleet,

10:07.706 --> 10:11.374
how closely are you working with the departments when they're looking

10:11.412 --> 10:15.454
at their budgets? Are you telling them, here's what we can expect for increase in

10:15.492 --> 10:18.914
costs and then they're doing their budget accordingly? Or are they just kind of left

10:18.952 --> 10:21.906
up to determining how much those costs might go up?

10:22.008 --> 10:25.718
Yes, we work with the departments regularly and

10:25.804 --> 10:28.998
we're actually seeing some unprecedented times.

10:29.164 --> 10:32.950
And so we're seeing some really high

10:33.020 --> 10:37.014
increase for the cost of vehicles. We're also seeing high

10:37.052 --> 10:41.370
increases for parts, but we're also seeing supply chain issues.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.402
And so what used to take six months to get is

10:45.456 --> 10:49.158
now taking up to 1824 months for delivery.

10:49.254 --> 10:53.402
And so what we're asking our departments to do is to focus on the critical

10:53.466 --> 10:57.226
vehicles in their shift within their fleet because they're

10:57.258 --> 11:00.282
much harder to get compared to previous.

11:00.426 --> 11:04.420
And so that's where our attention is at the moment. Thank you.

11:04.790 --> 11:08.766
Council Member Sally Alcorn, along those same lines

11:08.798 --> 11:12.286
as Council Member Peck, I noticed in the budget book you've got under fuel

11:12.318 --> 11:16.520
management there's a decrease, $3 million

11:16.890 --> 11:20.278
in that division. So I don't know if

11:20.284 --> 11:25.880
that's just because of when we were

11:31.160 --> 11:35.076
okay, so there was a decrease made relative to

11:35.178 --> 11:39.012
the current year budget. My understanding is that based

11:39.066 --> 11:42.228
on fuel prices, when we put the budget together,

11:42.394 --> 11:46.180
the cost of fuel is actually much less than what it currently

11:46.250 --> 11:50.696
is. We've had a spike since then. Will you probably make an adjustment to

11:50.718 --> 11:54.330
this? Because that did catch my eyes when I was looking at the divisions and

11:54.700 --> 11:58.510
how could fuel management be going down in these days?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.364
So we increased the budget by $4.5

12:02.402 --> 12:06.888
million during journal appropriations. So that kind of changed the balance

12:06.984 --> 12:10.432
and fuel for next year. So the original budget for fuel was $20 million.

12:10.486 --> 12:13.744
We increased it to $24 million, but the FY 23

12:13.782 --> 12:16.690
budget was 24 million and change. Okay,

12:17.700 --> 12:21.184
got it. Thank you. Not due to more LNG or

12:21.222 --> 12:24.864
electric cars or it's strictly that straight.

12:24.992 --> 12:28.676
Okay. Council member, abbey Cayman. Thank you. And Director, thank you

12:28.698 --> 12:32.036
for the presentation. I was hoping you wouldn't skip over the

12:32.058 --> 12:36.100
last page as it relates to fleet electrification.

12:36.180 --> 12:39.368
Really quickly off the top of your head, where are we

12:39.454 --> 12:42.840
in terms of percentage of total fleet moving towards

12:42.910 --> 12:47.240
hybrid or electric? In terms of percentage?

12:47.400 --> 12:51.004
Let's see. We're still very small. We're making

12:51.122 --> 12:54.316
incremental gains, I should say.

12:54.498 --> 12:57.736
Council just approved the purchase of 97 vehicles.

12:57.928 --> 13:02.320
We're getting ready to bring another package of roughly ten vehicles

13:03.220 --> 13:06.290
within probably the next month or so.

13:06.740 --> 13:11.144
One of the big issues that we're dealing with when it comes to purchasing

13:11.212 --> 13:15.380
electric vehicles is the limited capital budget that's available.

13:15.530 --> 13:19.110
And so as I mentioned earlier, the focus

13:19.560 --> 13:22.820
on capital and how we use that capital is

13:22.890 --> 13:26.440
on critical equipment. So the bulk of the money

13:26.510 --> 13:30.596
is going to police cars, fire trucks, and refuge

13:30.628 --> 13:34.616
trucks. Whatever is left over gets allocated to

13:34.638 --> 13:37.740
light duty vehicles. And that's where our opportunity

13:37.890 --> 13:41.372
is, to fund electric vehicles. Now, what we're working

13:41.426 --> 13:45.292
on now is we're trying to take advantage of the current used

13:45.346 --> 13:49.116
car market and sell off as many underutilized

13:49.148 --> 13:52.652
city vehicles as possible. We're using those proceeds

13:52.716 --> 13:56.336
to buy electric vehicles now. And one

13:56.358 --> 13:59.916
of the reasons I'm asking is, one is fuel continues

13:59.948 --> 14:04.070
to increase. We have supply shortages, vehicles that are

14:04.520 --> 14:07.716
way beyond their lifespan, and we need to continue to move

14:07.738 --> 14:11.552
towards the mayor's goal of a renewable energy fleet.

14:11.616 --> 14:15.064
However, I also know that the fire department, during their

14:15.102 --> 14:18.532
presentation with their lease program for certain vehicles,

14:18.596 --> 14:22.024
is showing improvements in returns on that. Are we

14:22.062 --> 14:26.496
considering that for other parts

14:26.548 --> 14:29.608
of the fleet, city of Houston fleet? Yes, ma'am.

14:29.624 --> 14:33.292
So, as I mentioned previously, we're in some unprecedented times here.

14:33.426 --> 14:36.796
Vehicle costs, as well as the ability to

14:36.818 --> 14:40.316
source parts to make repairs. We've got examples

14:40.348 --> 14:44.016
of fire trucks that were damaged in accidents earlier this year

14:44.118 --> 14:47.964
that are taking a year to 18 months to get repaired simply

14:48.012 --> 14:52.150
because parts aren't available. And so

14:52.600 --> 14:56.656
we have to start thinking strategically on how we ensure

14:56.768 --> 15:00.564
that our emergency services are sustained. And to

15:00.602 --> 15:04.048
that end, on top of that, we're having lots

15:04.064 --> 15:07.648
of difficulty, as I've heard the other departments mentioned,

15:07.754 --> 15:11.736
recruiting mechanics. And so as we look

15:11.758 --> 15:15.684
at our current situation, we being fleet management

15:15.732 --> 15:19.448
and our in house personnel focusing on that critical equipment.

15:19.544 --> 15:23.784
And we do think there's going to be some opportunities for increased leasing

15:23.912 --> 15:28.060
to help manage what's going on with the light duty vehicles.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.740
Let me back into you. Council Member Carolyn evan Shabaz.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.412
Thank you, Mayor Brutam. Thank you so much for this presentation.

15:38.556 --> 15:42.112
I just wanted to ask a question. Have there been any concerns

15:42.176 --> 15:45.508
about the theft of catalytic converters? Have any of

15:45.514 --> 15:49.220
them been stolen and are there any financial implications

15:49.800 --> 15:53.820
involved with protecting them with the fleet?

15:54.000 --> 15:59.796
Yes, ma'am. We did have a number of catalytic converters stolen knocking

15:59.828 --> 16:03.416
on wood, but it has been over six to

16:03.438 --> 16:07.080
eight months since we've recorded any thefts.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.436
I'm going off of memory here, but I want to say that the city

16:11.538 --> 16:15.736
has spent almost $400,000 in making repairs

16:15.768 --> 16:18.540
to those vehicles that were vandalized.

16:20.260 --> 16:24.210
Thank you, council Member Abby Cayman. Thank you,

16:24.980 --> 16:29.170
Director. Do we know how many employees right now are utilizing our fleet share program?

16:30.420 --> 16:34.100
I don't have that number. Off the top of my head, I will say that

16:34.250 --> 16:37.876
over the past year, we've worked very hard to get fleet share up.

16:37.978 --> 16:42.560
We saw numbers drop dramatically during the pandemic,

16:42.720 --> 16:45.716
and we're now starting to see an increase.

16:45.908 --> 16:50.052
What we've also been doing is for our client departments

16:50.116 --> 16:54.036
offering long term fleet share leases to cover their immediate

16:54.068 --> 16:57.480
needs. Our purpose is to get as many

16:57.550 --> 17:00.776
of the pool vehicles out in use, because they're

17:00.808 --> 17:04.604
not doing anything for the city when they're just sitting. And so I

17:04.642 --> 17:08.504
believe we're up, and I'll get back to you. But I believe we're

17:08.552 --> 17:11.928
at 50% right now, which is an

17:11.954 --> 17:15.836
improvement from I think we started somewhere around 30% earlier

17:15.868 --> 17:19.568
this year. But I'll be happy to get those details to you. Thank you.

17:19.654 --> 17:22.916
We'll submit all of these questions and a few others just to follow up in

17:22.938 --> 17:25.910
terms of electrification process progress. Thanks,

17:26.840 --> 17:30.788
Director Glascock. We have three public speakers here.

17:30.954 --> 17:33.380
Our first will be Jason Oliver.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.520
Good afternoon. Thank you all for the presentation.

17:43.860 --> 17:47.664
I think the first question kind of going along with what Council Member came

17:47.702 --> 17:50.852
in, was talking about, what's the kind of plan

17:50.906 --> 17:54.816
to budget for electrical vehicle charging infrastructure?

17:54.848 --> 17:58.288
I know that's going to be, of course, the electrification of the vehicles

17:58.384 --> 18:02.136
is important, but also the infrastructure for charging is

18:02.158 --> 18:05.416
vital as well. Right. So the purchase of

18:05.438 --> 18:09.412
infrastructure to recharge the electric vehicles is made under the capital

18:09.476 --> 18:13.764
program. We're also using the proceeds from vehicle

18:13.812 --> 18:17.548
sales to buy chargers as well. And so

18:17.634 --> 18:21.464
our idea currently is that we are going to need one charger

18:21.592 --> 18:25.340
for each electric vehicle that we purchase, at least initially.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.104
Okay. And then the vehicle lease program,

18:29.222 --> 18:32.512
what do we know about the environmental impact of that?

18:32.566 --> 18:36.096
Because it seems like while it might

18:36.118 --> 18:39.908
be cost effective, it has a significant environmental impact that might kind

18:39.914 --> 18:43.300
of offset what we're doing with the electrification.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.956
Well, in terms of environmental impact, I would say that the

18:47.978 --> 18:51.636
lease program has the same impact as

18:51.738 --> 18:55.544
purchasing a new vehicle. And so basically, what we're doing

18:55.662 --> 18:59.540
is pulling an older vehicle with older emissions,

18:59.620 --> 19:03.128
a higher emitting vehicle off the street, and replacing it with a

19:03.134 --> 19:06.460
newer vehicle. So I guess, in summary,

19:06.880 --> 19:10.696
anytime we can replace an old vehicle, we're improving the environmental

19:10.728 --> 19:14.264
impact, even if it's just being bought,

19:14.312 --> 19:18.496
because it's like a year or so, right. With some of these vehicles or the

19:18.518 --> 19:22.144
timing, so they won't be that old. In many

19:22.182 --> 19:26.640
cases, we are replacing model year 2000

19:26.790 --> 19:30.168
vehicles with these leases, and those vehicles,

19:30.204 --> 19:34.064
when they were built, had much more lenient emissions requirements

19:34.192 --> 19:37.684
compared to current year vehicles. And so just in that

19:37.722 --> 19:41.568
switch out alone, we provide for some environmental benefit.

19:41.664 --> 19:46.200
Got you. Thank you. Saba Blanding.

19:48.220 --> 19:51.770
Hey, good afternoon. I have a question

19:52.860 --> 19:56.540
similar to Jason's, just in terms of environmental impact,

19:57.040 --> 20:00.904
fuel consumption appears to be fairly consistent, around 10 million gallons

20:00.952 --> 20:04.748
annually. And I'm wondering if you all have

20:04.754 --> 20:08.364
any initiatives in place or proposed to significantly

20:08.412 --> 20:12.272
decrease fuel consumption. Well, we do. We have

20:12.406 --> 20:16.092
the targets of the Climate Action Plan to replace

20:16.156 --> 20:20.064
all the non emergency vehicles with electric vehicles

20:20.112 --> 20:23.492
by year 2030. And then we also have a

20:23.546 --> 20:28.480
vehicle selection criteria we use. So when vehicle

20:28.560 --> 20:32.304
purchases or leases are proposed to our department by our client

20:32.352 --> 20:35.624
departments, we look at a couple of different things. We look at the

20:35.662 --> 20:39.256
application, how the vehicle is being used, and then we

20:39.358 --> 20:43.416
look at the market to see, is there an electric vehicle available?

20:43.598 --> 20:46.796
If there is and it fits in the application, then we

20:46.818 --> 20:49.720
make the decision to purchase that electric vehicle.

20:49.880 --> 20:53.404
If an electric vehicle is not available, then we look

20:53.442 --> 20:57.456
to the market to see if a hybrid vehicle is available. And if

20:57.478 --> 21:01.216
there is, then we'll go hybrid. If we cannot satisfy the application

21:01.398 --> 21:05.024
with either an EV or a hybrid, then we

21:05.062 --> 21:08.210
purchase the conventional vehicle. Okay. Thank you,

21:09.320 --> 21:11.140
Mr. Bernard Butler.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.460
It's actually broderick like Matthew broderick.

21:22.360 --> 21:25.856
Sorry. Thank you for the presentation.

21:25.968 --> 21:29.720
And I don't mean to be critical. With all due respect, it was

21:29.790 --> 21:33.560
sobering, but I appreciate the honesty of

21:33.710 --> 21:37.224
why we as citizens walk

21:37.262 --> 21:42.472
around and see that Tesla is putting fueling

21:42.536 --> 21:45.996
stations in the HEB in

21:46.018 --> 21:49.660
Heights in Montrose. And it's kind of amazing, right?

21:49.730 --> 21:53.356
He's not a city government. He's richest man in the world.

21:53.538 --> 21:57.136
But for you to tell me that you're not over 2% because we

21:57.158 --> 22:00.416
can't get to this magical fleet of

22:00.438 --> 22:04.016
electric vehicles is very sobering. I would think that the

22:04.038 --> 22:07.604
soon to be third largest city in the country would

22:07.642 --> 22:10.724
have been leaps and bounds like Austin or

22:10.762 --> 22:14.256
some other place like that. But that's

22:14.288 --> 22:17.876
just a statement. I don't expect an answer. But I

22:18.058 --> 22:21.956
am very interested in the second part when you said you don't have mechanics.

22:22.068 --> 22:25.688
Well, in northeast Houston, where I am, we have a community

22:25.774 --> 22:29.608
college that we need to have someone have a strategic partnership with

22:29.694 --> 22:33.500
to teach young millennials to be actually

22:33.570 --> 22:37.480
mechanics. And not maybe old school mechanics, but mechanics of hybrids

22:37.560 --> 22:40.812
and fuel vehicles. So please give that some consideration going

22:40.866 --> 22:45.056
forward, looking down the road. Absolutely. And I might add that,

22:45.238 --> 22:48.704
in fact, we've got our Chief of Staff in the crowd here and we have

22:48.742 --> 22:52.688
made some pretty significant strides in reaching out to community

22:52.774 --> 22:56.116
colleges as well as high schools. The high school

22:56.218 --> 22:59.776
mechanic programs have proven to be very productive

22:59.888 --> 23:03.456
in finding and recruiting employees.

23:03.568 --> 23:08.128
And so we're pressing very hard with those learning institutions

23:08.224 --> 23:11.556
to try to get anything we can to help us out. The only

23:11.578 --> 23:14.856
person got to compete with is Chief Pena. He wants to be firemen. But if

23:14.878 --> 23:18.360
you get a couple of mechanics out of it, not a problem. Thank you.

23:18.430 --> 23:21.576
Thank you. And thank you,

23:21.598 --> 23:25.204
Mr. Glaxcock and Mr. Cruz. This concludes

23:25.252 --> 23:28.500
a Fleet Management Department workshop. So we will now adjourn

23:28.580 --> 23:31.772
for a second and begin our budget workshop

23:31.796 --> 23:34.770
up on the Housing Department. Thank you.
