00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,250
This concludes our Administrative and Regulatory Affairs Budget workshop.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,626
We will now begin our budget workshop for the municipal courts.

3
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:11,066
And at this time, I would like to welcome Judge Elaine

4
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:14,494
Marshall and CFO Nellie Santos to provide the

5
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:16,750
municipal courts budget presentation.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,040
Put the chair up too high.

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,720
Thank. Thank you.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,390
Welcome, your Honor. And that floor is yours.

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,640
And good afternoon and

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,974
council members. I am here and it is my pleasure to present today the Municipal

11
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:48,222
Court Department's FY 23 Budget.

12
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:51,742
Attending with me today is McD's Chief Financial

13
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:56,006
Officer, Deputy Director Nellie Santos, and she's seated with me today as

14
00:00:56,028 --> 00:01:00,162
well as members of my executive team who are in the audience. This presentation

15
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,830
is reflective of our commitment to our community to provide

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,690
court services in an equitable and safe manner.

17
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,610
Next slide, please. Our General Fund

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,894
consists of seven cost centers, each of them having budgets assigned,

19
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,320
staffed, and specific core services.

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,722
This slide includes four of the seven cost centers.

21
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:25,610
The system support cost. Center has no assigned FTEs.

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,974
Next slide. This slide includes

23
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:33,890
the remaining three General Fund cost centers. Next slide.

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,346
Municipal Court also manages four special funds that provide specific

25
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:43,314
services, including security, technology, and truancy

26
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:46,674
prevention. The Municipal Jury Fund is our fourth

27
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:50,242
special fund and currently has no assigned FTEs

28
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:53,474
or expenditure budget. This is a newly created

29
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:57,382
fund and expenditures will be budgeted once the fund balance

30
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:59,420
increases. Next slide, please.

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,474
Listed on this slide are McD's major services.

32
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,254
These services help us to achieve our overall goals and our

33
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,430
mission. Next slide.

34
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,646
Our courts are mandated by law to provide a legal forum for

35
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,362
the individuals charged with criminal offenses.

36
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:21,806
Included in these mandates are the right to a jury trial,

37
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:25,234
equal access to the legal system, and adherence to our

38
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:28,260
state and local law. Next slide, please.

39
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,346
Sorry. Oh. Next slide,

40
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,334
please. MCD has

41
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:44,838
many internal revenue generating initiatives that provide

42
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:48,102
enhanced court services to the public and assist

43
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,574
municipal courts in achieving its overall revenue target.

44
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:55,414
These services include passports, weddings notary,

45
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:58,874
and the printing of driving records to better serve target

46
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:02,410
areas within our community. We have various specialized

47
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,854
dockets that provide meaningful and safe methods for

48
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:09,546
case resolution, including the Veterans Court and the Safe

49
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:12,866
Harbor Court. Judges assigned to these dockets have

50
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:16,562
the ability to reduce fines, offer payment plans, or other

51
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:20,270
methods of case resolution to individuals who are experiencing

52
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,086
hardships but who still want to fulfill their legal obligations to

53
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:27,446
the court. I'm happy to report that Teen Court was able

54
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:30,994
to resume their in person monthly activities in FY

55
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:34,754
22. This program has made long lasting impressions

56
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:37,946
on the lives of our youth by providing a glimpse at the

57
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,306
legal system through firsthand participation and

58
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:44,838
through mentorship provided by our professional volunteers.

59
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:48,826
Next slide, please. I think we're

60
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:52,622
one slide ahead of me now. There we go.

61
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:56,174
MCD began decentralizing court services many

62
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:59,882
years ago, anticipating the future growth in the population.

63
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:03,234
We serve our full service courts can be found in

64
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:06,494
key areas of the city and they include our central

65
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:10,318
location, Macawa, West Side and North Command.

66
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:13,982
We also have annex courts that are open and located

67
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:17,414
in Kingwood and the Clear Lake areas which are open one day per

68
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:21,174
week, and a court at the Joint Processing Center which we

69
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:25,046
perform and they handle jail, dockets and magistrate court services,

70
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:29,210
and we do those. That court is in operation seven days a week,

71
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,954
22 hours a day, 365 days a year.

72
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:36,602
We also anticipated the greater use of technology and

73
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:39,594
have implemented many web based processes.

74
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:43,290
Our short term messaging service provides text messages

75
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,546
and email reminders to our customers about upcoming scheduled

76
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:51,494
court dates, as well as important emergency notifications

77
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:54,802
to address the needs of our diverse community and to allow

78
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:58,882
full participation in the legal service. We have full time

79
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:02,146
certified Spanish interpreters as well as access to

80
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:06,054
other languages through contract services and the language line.

81
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,480
Next slide, please.

82
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,358
This slide represents a comparison of revenue for FY 21,

83
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:18,022
FY 22 and FY 23 for all MCD

84
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:22,010
funds and the percentage change between the FY 23

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,270
proposed and the FY 22 estimates.

86
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,514
As reflected, there is an overall 3% decrease in revenue

87
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,114
across all funds for FY 23. Next slide,

88
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:36,974
please. Despite the COVID challenges and the

89
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:40,834
lower rate of citation issuance, we expect FY 22

90
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:44,606
General Fund revenues to exceed the budget target.

91
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:48,110
This increase is attributed to the resumption of all the dockets,

92
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,046
including cases that were delayed during the suspension period.

93
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:55,654
This increase is also due to the high level of performance from

94
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:59,826
our internal and external collection teams, McD's revenue

95
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:04,054
generated initiatives, and the deferred payment program for

96
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:07,446
FY 23. We project a slight decrease

97
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,526
in General Fund revenue from the FY 22 projection due

98
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:15,174
to a reduction in the number of backlog cases and a continued

99
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:18,000
lower citation rates. Next slide, please.

100
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,402
This slide includes revenue highlights for our four MCD

101
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:27,306
special funds. The annual variances in the revenue

102
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:30,942
budgets for the funds remain in line with the General Fund

103
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:34,142
for FY 23. We anticipate a reduction

104
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:37,742
in the grant funding from the office of the Governor for our Juvenile

105
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:41,774
Case Manager Truancy Prevention initiative. Through this grant,

106
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:45,586
we have been able to expand our program to additional schools.

107
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:49,606
However, this reduction may negatively impact the services

108
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:53,154
we provide to our partner school districts. Next slide,

109
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:57,446
please. This slide represents a comparison

110
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,242
of expenditures for FY 21, FY 22

111
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:05,034
and FY 23 for all MCD funds and the

112
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:08,710
percentage change between FY 23 proposed

113
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,462
and FY 22 budgets. There is a 2.3

114
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:16,234
overall increase in expenditures across all MCD

115
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:19,760
funds for FY 23. Next slide, please.

116
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,902
80% of the General Fund expenditure budget consists of personnel

117
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:29,854
cost. The remaining 20% is non personnel

118
00:07:29,902 --> 00:07:32,858
costs that include inner fund accounts, CSMART,

119
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:35,446
support supplies and services.

120
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:36,920
Next slide, please.

121
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,354
99% of the building security fund expenditure

122
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:45,782
budget is non personnel and it includes contract

123
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:49,642
security services. The remaining 1% of the budget is

124
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:53,818
personnel and is related to the retiree health benefits cost.

125
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:57,634
Next slide, please. The majority

126
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:01,898
of the court technology fund expenditure budget is nonpersonal.

127
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:05,290
It includes software and hardware licensing,

128
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,182
maintenance costs, CSMART support and other planned technology

129
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:13,422
enhancements. The remaining 18% is personnel

130
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,300
cost. Next slide, please.

131
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,370
90% of the local Tourancy Prevention and Diversion

132
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,850
Fund expenditure budget is personnel costs.

133
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,990
The remaining 10% is non personnel cost,

134
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,782
including education and training supplies, as well as

135
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:35,610
teen court and student engagement activities. Next slide.

136
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,682
This worksheet provides an overview of the expenditure net

137
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:43,754
change between the FY 22 and the

138
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,598
FY 23 General Fund budgets.

139
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:50,494
FY 23 reflects a 2.2% increase in

140
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:54,282
expenditures. This increase is due to the resumption of dockets

141
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:57,246
and the related increases in court services,

142
00:08:57,428 --> 00:09:01,326
noticing jury cost, postage language services,

143
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:05,406
variances in the inner fund accounts, pension and health benefit

144
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:09,294
rates, and the two Hope 3% increases. Next slide,

please. This slide provides our FY 23

146
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:16,230
expenditure highlights for the General Fund.

147
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,574
We will continue to maintain the court CSMART System

148
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:24,006
fund, contractual increases in the security and armored car service,

149
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:28,234
language services, passport program costs, and citation book

150
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:32,214
printing. Next slide, please. This slide

151
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:35,894
provides expenditure highlights for our four special revenue

152
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,854
funds. Expenditures in these funds include contract security

153
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:43,838
services, technology maintenance and enhancement cost,

154
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:47,914
and Truancy prevention services. Two of these four funds

155
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,770
include personnel cost. Next slide.

156
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,294
This concludes the budget portion. Now we'll proceed to the next section

157
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:59,374
of this presentation. The next section of the presentation will highlight

158
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:02,426
other department level information. Next slide,

159
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:05,686
please. This list provides more detail

160
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:09,714
regarding our citywide interfund our citywide restricted

161
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:12,280
accounts. Sorry. Next slide, please.

162

The MCD organizational chart on this slide includes our

163
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:20,502
leadership team and lines of direct and indirect

164
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:23,050
reporting. Next slide.

165
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,866
The information provided here reflects the diversity of our

166
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:30,960
municipal court team. Next slide, please.

167
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,122
I am pleased to be able to share with you some of our major accomplishments

168
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:39,754
from this past year on the next two slides. While we remained

169
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:43,662
operational throughout COVID Pandemic, we suspended regular

170
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,646
dockets and jury service for over a year. This resulted

171
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:52,126
in a large number of our cases that needed to be reset and rescheduled.

172
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:56,134
We have worked diligently since then, resuming dockets from

173
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:59,686
last April to reschedule these cases, handle the volume of

174
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,810
new cases, and maintain lower docket levels to meet safe distancing

175
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,706
requirements. We also summoned jurors at a reduced level

176
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:11,354
and found a solution for masking by implementing a clear

177
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:14,806
mask option for the jurors selected for trials.

178
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:18,606
Our Passport program is celebrating its first year

179
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:22,314
anniversary. To date, our Passport program has assisted

180
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:26,334
almost 3000 individuals to obtain their passports and

181
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:30,062
has generated $115,000 in that year.

182
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:33,714
I'm extremely proud of our staff who has worked very hard to obtain their

183
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:37,666
certification as passport agents and their dedication to the

184
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:41,262
success of our program. Our program has been recognized

185
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,950
by the US. Department of State for excellent customer service

186
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,390
and for increasing the availability of this public

187
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,782
service. Next slide. In order

188
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,402
to better serve our other areas of our community,

189
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:59,174
the Juvenile Case Manager Program expanded its Truancy

190
00:11:59,222 --> 00:12:03,382
prevention services to include the Aldine Independent School District

191
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:07,322
this past year. Our Deferred Payment Program was

192
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,926
recently recognized by the Government Collections Association of

193
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:14,654
Texas as being the most innovative collection program

194
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:18,286
for 2021. This program has a great team of

195
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:21,758
dedicated staff who work very closely with individuals

196
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:26,062
who need time to pay their fines and who track cases through the successful

197
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:29,826
compliance. Court security remains at the forefront in

198
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:31,998
our today's challenging environment.

199
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:35,682
McD's Court Security Committee includes

200
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:39,138
broad range of internal and external participants,

201
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:42,870
and we meet monthly to discuss security related issues.

202
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,246
Next slide, please. The major unmet

203
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:49,974
need for MCD is the replacement

204
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:53,210
of our central facility. We suffered major

205
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,020
damage from Hurricane Harvey almost five years ago.

206
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,102
Our court staff has been extremely flexible and

207
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,846
several workarounds have been implemented, including doubling up in

208
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,426
courts, doubling up in offices, sharing workspaces,

209
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,078
and dealing with additional flooding and infrastructure

210
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:16,098
failures as they arise and occur throughout the building.

211
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:19,102
We are currently working very closely with the Mayor,

212
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:23,122
GSD, Finance and FEMA to find a permanent solution

213
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:26,200
for this ongoing facility replacement project.

214
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,974
Next slide, please. This concludes the

215
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:33,318
presentation of our FY 23 budget. Just wanted to

216
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:37,474
thank my entire court team. They have been resilient and positive throughout

217
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:40,822
this entire five years, doing the things that were necessary

218
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,950
to keep the courts up, to keep the courts running, to keep the courts operational,

219
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,634
and they have been doing an excellent job. And I would also like

220
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:52,318
to thank the mayor, all of you council members for your continued support

221
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:56,074
and my partner departments as GSD. Sometimes they let me knock

222
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:59,454
out a wall, sometimes they won't. But we have done

223
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:03,018
everything we can to keep the courts at the central location up and

224
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:06,626
running for our citizens of Houston. And at this time, I welcome any

225
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:10,750
questions you have. Thank you. Judge, do you have any insight

226
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,094
on our site and release initiative? How many cases come

227
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:17,800
to courts based on the site and release program?

228
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,440
Site and release? Yes.

229
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,222
They never come to municipal court for Class C misdemeanors?

230
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:29,820
No, sir. Okay.

231
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,326
All right. What about the associate judges positions?

232
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:38,022
Have we filled those or how are we looking for the Associate

233
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,534
municipal court judges? We are still going through

234
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:44,750
the boards of commission to see who is applying. To date,

235
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,190
we really don't have very many applicants because we are looking

236
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,220
for more applicants for the Associate Judge position.

237
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,470
I think I have contacted Jackie

238
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,994
and the newest person there who took Maria's place,

239
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:03,140
and we're still trying to get applicants in. If you could send

240
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,794
additional information to my office again like you all did earlier

241
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:11,446
in the year so we can reach out to our networks to see if we

242
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:15,000
can get some people to apply, we'll do great

243
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,610
council Member Abby Cayman. Thank you, Vice Chair.

244
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,626
Judge, I think you've spotlighted all

245
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:27,302
of the challenges that the municipal courts continue to face,

246
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:30,190
again, distinct from criminal and civil.

247
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,958
But going back to the accomplishments you listed, I know when

248
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:38,634
we've been talking at Public Safety Committee night court,

249
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:40,030
team court,

250
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,618
all of the different efforts to meet people

251
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:49,090
where they are, make sure they aren't unduly penalized

252
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,074
and do right by them and do right by the city

253
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:56,840
and law enforcement. Right. So I just want to give you all credit for that

254
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,560
really quickly on the building, because you mentioned that.

255
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,786
Talk to us about some of those challenges, if you can.

256
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:09,226
Again, we are still dealing with the

257
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:12,614
impacts of Harvey COVID, the structural

258
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:15,866
damage. But what is that doing to the court process?

259
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:18,300
The ability to function day to day.

260
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,750
When Harvey hit, it wiped out the entire basement, as everybody

261
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,962
knows. And we had six courts, I think, in operation.

262
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,802
We had a bonding section, parking section, the bailiffs,

263
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,770
we had different offices there. So all of those offices

264
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,786
had to move somewhere. And the only court

265
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:41,086
we had on the first floor was one court. And we have all of

266
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:44,834
the cashiers and their departments

267
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:48,806
there. The second floor had courtrooms. And so we

268
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:52,434
have staff that we have renovated closets

269
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:55,500
to put supervisors in.

270
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,030
We have judges that are doubling up with courts and court dockets.

271
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,914
We have done everything we could to maintain the

272
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:09,450
atmosphere of a court that's friendly and safe for everyone.

273
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,642
And then came COVID. And with COVID you can't

274
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:17,134
stand close to each other. So it took the limited amount

275
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:20,494
of space we had in the courtroom and cut it in half.

276
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:24,594
And so that's how we have been operating now,

277
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:28,274
but we're opening back up into sitting next to each other.

278
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:31,486
But I have been mandated by the Supreme Court

279
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,926
and I've given the authority to have everyone wear

280
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,694
a mask because we see 2000, 3000 people a day. I just

281
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:42,630
think it's safer that way for the employees. And I appreciate that because

282
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,186
more shutdowns are going to create a further backlog. So I

283
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,340
completely get that really quickly.

284
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,500
In terms of other needs, concerns for the future,

285
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,340
talk to me about truancy prevention and how that's going.

286
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,190
Our truancy prevention is basically

287
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,614
we have a fund from we have grant funding and we

288
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,974
started out with grant funding that was

289
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:12,594
around the $700,000 range. We have

290
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:16,610
seven juvenile case managers that operate under that grant.

291
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,394
We have now submitted a request for

292
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:25,730
additional grants and right now it's pending approval

293
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,430
temporarily. They're saying that we may get 100,000.

294
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,334
If we just get 100,000. There may be some other options we

295
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:37,354
have to have to go to do so. That is an unmet need because for

296
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:40,922
the school district to have juvenile case

297
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:44,186
managers in there who know the kids if they come to

298
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,886
teen court, the defendants who come to teen court, chances are a

299
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:50,830
juvenile case manager knows that kid.

300
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,638
And if we have to cut it, it's going to

301
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:57,550
be a disservice, I think, to our youth.

302
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,614
I just received word on the way yesterday

303
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:05,298
to Teen Court's final thing that I do believe.

304
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:09,060
I don't know if he is my first, but one of the first

305
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,018
juveniles student volunteers that came through Teen

306
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:16,678
Court is about to graduate from the University of Houston's Law School.

307
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,840
So I was very proud of that.

308
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,150
But if the Juvenile case managers,

309
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,566
if we have enough money to keep

310
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,946
what we have, we can work. But I'm not really sure we're going to be

311
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,430
able to keep what we have with just that amount of grant funding.

312
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,954
So are you saying that we may lose the 700,000 that we

313
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:40,474
currently have? 700,000 is what they

314
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:45,566
started off giving us. Then we went down to 500 and

315
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:48,000
now the proposed is 125,

316
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,060
I think you're saying is the Truancy program as is cannot continue.

317
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,106
We have seven JCMS that are funded there. We may be

318
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,890
able to fund three, but four we may lose.

319
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,000
If you could keep us apprised of that,

320
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,800
I would very much appreciate that.

321
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,966
Council Member David Robinson. Thank you, Chair judge

322
00:20:12,998 --> 00:20:17,758
Marshall, thank you for being here. In your final page

323
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:21,418
of your final slide of your appendix

324
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:24,560
and your final bullet on that final page,

325
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,926
you asked a mouthful, stating, in partnership with

326
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:32,162
the Mayor's office, Finance, GSD and FEMA, we continue

327
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:35,566
to seek an agreeable option for the replacement of the Central Court

328
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:37,940
facility. Do you have anything to add to that,

329
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,878
please, council members? Can we

330
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:46,280
get your support as well? You have my support.

331
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,714
I think our hands are basically tied by FEMA

332
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:55,080
right now. For them to say, yes,

333
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,566
we'll give you this funding, or no, we won't give you this funding,

334
00:20:58,598 --> 00:21:02,620
or yes, we're giving you some. And it has been like

335
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,730
so there are some plans out there, Judge, as you know.

336
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,222
And I guess what I'm asking you is if you have anything more to add

337
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:12,670
and it sounds like we're in a pattern.

338
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,520
Okay, thank you very much.

339
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,062
Thank you, Judge, and Miss Santos for your presentations.

340
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:25,860
And you are dismissed. Thank you. Thank you.

341
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,266
And also thank you to your entire staff, your whole team back there, everyone who's

342
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:38,600
in the chambers and not here. Thank you all for everything you do as well.

343
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,226
We will now move into the public comment period. I will start

344
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:52,506
with the virtual speakers. Please press star six to unmute when you hear

345
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:56,330
your name. The first speaker is Ms. Saba Blanding.

346
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,806
Hey, good afternoon again. I had a

347
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:05,134
couple of questions. The first is, is there a

348
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:08,922
plan to extend and expand the Safe Harbor Court

349
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:13,170
from a public safety presentation? Last year, we had processed around

350
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,862
1000 with 500,000 cases outstanding.

351
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:20,382
How many people have been served in comparison to the eligible

352
00:22:20,446 --> 00:22:23,702
population? And then my second question

353
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:27,826
is in regards to the truancy prevention initiatives.

354
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:31,926
I'm curious what organizations and departments are collaborating in

355
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:35,466
truancy prevention initiatives. Are there others in the

356
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:39,014
Houston ecosystem to engage for compassionate approaches

357
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:40,650
to truancy prevention?

358
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,506
So for great questions, the first one, we're going

359
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,110
to take that question and get a response from you

360
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,218
regarding the Safe Harbor courts. So please submit

361
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:57,520
that in writing over to District E at

362
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,034
district E at Houst Gov and we'll get back to you

363
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:05,570
shortly. Your second question on the truancy.

364
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,694
I know that my Brother's Keeper, as well as the Credible Messenger

365
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:13,766
program that we initiated last year, are working in collaboration with

366
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:16,520
the municipal courts on the truancy issues.

367
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,582
They do collaborations with the wraparound service and college

368
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:23,430
counselors at some of the high schools.

369
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,090
So they are working in tandem with

370
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,750
different stakeholders and community groups on enhancing

371
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,146
that program and trying to make sure that it's beneficial for the

372
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,702
youth. Okay.

373
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:42,720
Thank you. You're welcome. Amanda she.

374
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,798
Hi, thank you. It feels like a theme

375
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:53,694
across a lot of these budget

376
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:57,294
presentations, like from the Health Department, department of Neighborhoods,

377
00:23:57,342 --> 00:24:01,950
things like that, is we're losing a lot of budget

378
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,202
in terms of support for the youth.

379
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:09,826
And I think this is just a statement, really. It just feels

380
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:13,430
like a really great loss in a time when

381
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,906
there's already so much for the kids to overcome what

382
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:23,834
was having lost a lot of support with

383
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:27,558
the schools and things like that. Yeah,

384
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:31,066
I just wanted to highlight that. Thank you for highlighting

385
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:34,414
that. And also be mindful that outside of just the city

386
00:24:34,452 --> 00:24:39,034
of Houston, there are many nonprofits

387
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:43,214
and different organizations with youth emphasis that we collaborate

388
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:47,026
with all of our offices, kind of work with some of these neighborhood and

389
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:50,878
after school program groups that are focused on youth engagement.

390
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:54,694
And so although some of the funding may not be there through the city

391
00:24:54,732 --> 00:24:58,742
of Houston, there are still ways in which we partner with

392
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:03,160
a lot of great agencies that are still doing similar wonderful work

393
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:08,010
for the youth as well. The next speaker is Jason Oliver.

394
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,100
I want to pick up where Amanda left off.

395
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,986
I have worked closely with my brother's Keeper on

396
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:20,830
initiatives, and it looks like we're set to lose it from the Health Department.

397
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,862
And I remember looking at all those that were

398
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:28,302
green, right, that were funded from the general fund,

399
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:31,870
which was a small portion in comparison to the red

400
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,978
that were not funded. So, yes,

401
00:25:35,064 --> 00:25:38,846
there are a lot of programs in the community and right and like private programs

402
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:42,514
and such, but one of the important things that somebody has brought up

403
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:45,926
before during these workshops is like the consistency when

404
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:49,154
you have a city entity or a city agency

405
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:53,026
that's putting these things forward. So I just really think it's

406
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:56,886
important to be especially as we're talking about focusing

407
00:25:56,918 --> 00:26:00,854
on crime and a lot of this deals with youth and touches

408
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:04,774
youth and it's hard to find programs and consistent

409
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:08,646
programming for youth in many spaces and areas

410
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:12,526
around the city that's in no way equitably distributed. So I just

411
00:26:12,628 --> 00:26:16,814
want to flag that and then I'm trying to figure out

412
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:20,398
what's going on with Site and release. She said that it doesn't touch

413
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:24,340
the municipal courts. I'm not a lawyer, so I don't understand

414
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,474
why that is, but I was hoping that there would be some changes that

415
00:26:29,512 --> 00:26:33,382
have been made as a result of Site

416
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:36,550
and Release adoption that we can see here in the municipal courts.

417
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,298
Great questions. I too am involved

418
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:45,158
with my Brother's Keeper program. I can tell you that that

419
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:48,858
as you know, was started through the Obama administration. So many of

420
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:52,298
the funds that came through for that initiative, not only for the

421
00:26:52,304 --> 00:26:56,218
City of Houston, but all around the country, were federal dollars that we find

422
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,950
matching grants and then can also provide dollars through our

423
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,214
Council District service funds for specific initiatives in our

424
00:27:03,252 --> 00:27:07,274
district. So that's always been a program that we relied

425
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:10,802
on for outside dollars. When it comes to

426
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:15,166
the neighborhood programs and nonprofits

427
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,802
regarding the youth, many times through

428
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:22,302
my experience, they actually do a much

429
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:26,114
better job of being consistent

430
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:29,286
with the youth that they see. They're right there in

431
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:32,630
those neighborhoods, in those schools, so they understand the dynamics

432
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,946
of each of those communities. And many times for the city,

433
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,714
we rely on partnering with them because they have

434
00:27:40,752 --> 00:27:44,314
more of a boots on the ground and wider perspective on what are

435
00:27:44,352 --> 00:27:47,862
the specific needs for those kids and those programs.

436
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:51,822
And so although the City of Houston may not put

437
00:27:51,876 --> 00:27:55,854
forth some of those programs, we definitely try to support in as many ways as

438
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:59,582
possible many of our offices allocate dollars

439
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,682
towards the Case for Kids program with Harris County, which does

440
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:07,582
tremendous work for after school programming and extracurricular

441
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:11,506
activities for the youth. So we'll continue to

442
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:14,806
do that. But if there are specific programs that

443
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:18,054
you have highlighted or identified in the presentations that you

444
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:21,394
think we need to allocate more resources

445
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:25,846
towards, then of course, please let us know that as well and

446
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:29,322
then we'll get an answer to you on the site and release, because I have

447
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:32,906
similar questions. I was to the impression that since it was a

448
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:36,122
citable offense that it would be at the municipal court level,

449
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:39,818
but I may be wrong on that. So we're going

450
00:28:39,824 --> 00:28:43,022
to get some clarification and then we'll provide that feedback as well.

451
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:46,394
So to ensure we get it to you in a prompt fashion,

452
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:49,990
if you would email that directly to District E at houst

453
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:56,794
gov and we'll get a response and

454
00:28:56,832 --> 00:29:00,842
that will complete our public Speakers for the

455
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:03,210
Municipal Courts budget presentation.

456
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,494
Before we adjourn, please note that budget workshops have

457
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:14,462
concluded for all City of Houston departments. We will have

458
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:18,186
our next BFA Committee meeting on Tuesday, May 31 at

459
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:22,098
10:00 a.m.. I want to give a shout out to all the community members

460
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:26,210
who took time to come in person and speak virtually

461
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,590
on these topics. Your engagement was beneficial.

462
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,410
It was of value to us. We learned from you,

463
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,090
and we will get any answers that have been unanswered to you.

464
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,466
Shortly. A reminder to all council members to

465
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:43,414
be checking SharePoint for uploaded presentations,

466
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:46,646
as well as responses for any questions submitted.

467
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:50,234
Thank you again to everyone for being here today, and this meeting is

468
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:51,130
adjourned.
