WEBVTT

00:00.810 --> 00:03.760
That concludes the public speakers list.

00:05.890 --> 00:10.590
And now we will move on to welcome

00:10.740 --> 00:13.962
the Director, margaret Wallace Brown and Roger Hamilton,

00:14.026 --> 00:17.950
to provide the Planning and Development Budget workshop presentation.

00:42.170 --> 00:45.634
Welcome, Director, and the floor is yours. Thank you. Good afternoon,

00:45.682 --> 00:49.058
council members. Let me begin by introducing

00:49.154 --> 00:52.346
the team that I have with me today. We may be relying on them for

00:52.368 --> 00:55.338
some answers to questions, so I want to make sure I introduce them.

00:55.504 --> 00:59.930
First of all, at my right is Roger Hamilton. He is our department CFO

01:00.090 --> 01:03.626
and he leads the finance team, which includes Alejandro Garcia,

01:03.658 --> 01:07.134
Maribel Torres and Donnella Gamilian. Also with us

01:07.172 --> 01:11.210
today is our communication team and council liaison, elise Marion

01:11.290 --> 01:15.026
and Anna Sedillo. And then the other part of our

01:15.048 --> 01:18.174
leadership in our department is our Deputy Director,

01:18.222 --> 01:22.014
Jennifer Austland, and our Assistant Director in Chief Transportation

01:22.062 --> 01:25.874
Planner, David Fields. And so I may be leaning on some of them for

01:25.912 --> 01:29.480
some of your questions. Let me go ahead and start.

01:29.850 --> 01:33.266
So my name is Margaret Wallace Brown. I'm the director of the Planning and Development

01:33.298 --> 01:36.406
Department. And before I present an overview of the

01:36.428 --> 01:39.998
Planning and Development Department budget, I'd like to take a moment to reaffirm

01:40.114 --> 01:43.466
my deep appreciation for your support of the planning team and all the

01:43.488 --> 01:46.774
work we do. We take great pride in being a resource

01:46.822 --> 01:50.038
for the Mayor and Council districts and our fellow departments.

01:50.134 --> 01:54.750
We take our work very seriously when we work with you. In 2021,

01:54.820 --> 01:58.266
we adopted a new mission statement growing and Preserving

01:58.298 --> 02:02.334
Houston's Diverse Communities to create a resilient city with

02:02.372 --> 02:05.826
record number of platts and permits and an increasing portfolio of

02:05.848 --> 02:09.874
new projects. 2021 has been our most productive year and

02:09.912 --> 02:13.406
our most innovative year. I'd like to demonstrate how we are fulfilling

02:13.438 --> 02:17.270
that mission as I share a few highlight reels of our accomplishments.

02:17.770 --> 02:21.654
First of all, our platting requests hit an all time high with

02:21.692 --> 02:26.358
over more than 3000 platts in 2021. That was a 25%

02:26.444 --> 02:30.060
increase on our previous record year, which was 2020.

02:30.430 --> 02:34.170
We also saw a steady increase in building permits, with 22

02:34.320 --> 02:38.714
300 building permits planners reviewing approximately 1200

02:38.752 --> 02:42.122
plans per month. On a different

02:42.176 --> 02:46.186
note, Friedmanstown was designated as the city's first heritage district.

02:46.298 --> 02:49.962
We also added ten more landmarks, a new historic district,

02:50.026 --> 02:53.506
and we have another one in the works. Our team is engaging with residents in

02:53.528 --> 02:57.170
Glenburg Valley, where we conducted a window workshop and worked on design

02:57.240 --> 02:59.570
guidelines for three historic districts.

03:00.470 --> 03:04.018
More accomplishments include our transportation planning area,

03:04.104 --> 03:07.206
which our Vision Zero Action plan earned a

03:07.228 --> 03:10.466
Gold Award for implementation from the Texas Chapter of the American Planning

03:10.498 --> 03:14.178
Association. Vision Zero is implementing all 13

03:14.274 --> 03:17.894
priority actions, and highlights include continuing engagement

03:17.942 --> 03:22.150
to identify locations of concern updating the city street designs,

03:22.230 --> 03:25.926
redesigning ten high injury network locations, and receiving

03:25.958 --> 03:30.010
$4 million in highway safety improvement funding from Techstot.

03:30.690 --> 03:34.254
The first more space Main Street patio opened with Little

03:34.292 --> 03:37.578
Dipper. Followed shortly after that with Shay McElroy, the Flying

03:37.594 --> 03:41.466
Saucer and Finn Hall. The More space Main Street initiative

03:41.498 --> 03:44.574
was a great success and was approved for an extension,

03:44.622 --> 03:48.354
keeping it going through 2023 in 2021,

03:48.392 --> 03:51.806
together with our partners, we completed the Austin Hutchins,

03:51.918 --> 03:56.370
Gray, Leland and Polk Street Bikeways,

03:56.450 --> 03:59.746
including Cullen Boulevard. Also, they were initiated

03:59.778 --> 04:03.538
in response to the Build 50 challenge. We added the Clear Lake West

04:03.554 --> 04:07.026
Chase Trail extensions and segments of the Spring Branch Trail.

04:07.138 --> 04:10.726
So now we have High comfort bikeway off of East Freeway

04:10.758 --> 04:14.742
at Federal and Maxi and these complete 40 miles

04:14.806 --> 04:18.140
of high comfort bike network in our city.

04:18.510 --> 04:22.154
The transportation team also engaged with the community to build safety improvements

04:22.202 --> 04:25.578
in Briar Meadows and set a guest with council

04:25.594 --> 04:28.986
members Thomas and Jackson. We partnered with Harris

04:29.018 --> 04:32.306
County Health Department, received funding from MD Anderson to start the

04:32.328 --> 04:35.826
city's first Safe Routes to School program in

04:35.848 --> 04:39.854
Acres Home. Our Livable Places Action Committee celebrated

04:39.902 --> 04:43.886
its first anniversary, reached consensus on recommendations from Chapter

04:43.918 --> 04:47.442
42 technical amendments, which you graciously approved yesterday,

04:47.586 --> 04:51.106
established a focus group to work on conservation districts, and released

04:51.138 --> 04:54.214
a single family residential survey that garnered over 1200

04:54.252 --> 04:57.930
responses. We received a grant from the AARP,

04:58.350 --> 05:01.990
which we used to organize an accessory dwelling unit

05:02.070 --> 05:05.782
garage apartment for many design competition to promote

05:05.846 --> 05:09.238
compact, affordable housing design options for Houstonians.

05:09.334 --> 05:12.894
The grant funded a series of workshops and the design contest and

05:12.932 --> 05:16.634
culminated in the publication of a book, all of which was managed,

05:16.682 --> 05:20.918
implemented and designed by our staff in the complete communities

05:21.034 --> 05:24.642
planning and development led initiatives such as Neighborhood Character preservation Tool

05:24.696 --> 05:28.578
Workshops, Lights on Houston Community Events Building

05:28.744 --> 05:32.670
Food Security Workshop and working with CenterPoint Energy Agency's

05:32.750 --> 05:36.306
Action Program. So these are our accomplishments over

05:36.328 --> 05:39.574
the past year, but I also want to provide a very brief overview of our

05:39.612 --> 05:43.126
priorities, new projects and frequently recurring quests that we're expecting to

05:43.148 --> 05:46.786
come for the coming year. As all of you know, we're working with council districts

05:46.818 --> 05:50.458
on Redistricting, both on the ongoing public engagement as well as

05:50.464 --> 05:53.686
the technical and data analysis support for realignment of district

05:53.718 --> 05:57.900
boundaries. That process will continue through September of 2022.

05:58.430 --> 06:01.770
Staff is creating a team to provide demographic and population

06:01.850 --> 06:05.754
projections for the city of Houston. Up until now, we've not projected

06:05.802 --> 06:09.802
population, we've simply identified what other agencies

06:09.866 --> 06:13.346
have calculated. So projections will be new for us and

06:13.368 --> 06:17.154
for the city, and it will support other city departments in right sizing their

06:17.192 --> 06:20.786
service operations. Our transportation planners have so

06:20.808 --> 06:24.114
many projects, it's hard to keep up, but I hope you had a chance

06:24.152 --> 06:27.718
to listen to the Mayor's State of Mobility address this afternoon. A transcript and a

06:27.724 --> 06:31.062
video is going to be available later today, but in addition to that,

06:31.116 --> 06:33.430
we have increased coordination with Metro,

06:33.930 --> 06:37.494
specifically about the University Corridor and the Intercatty Bus Rapid

06:37.542 --> 06:40.714
Transit lines. We're also receiving frequent requests for

06:40.752 --> 06:44.650
connectivity studies in various council districts and

06:44.720 --> 06:48.134
Houston is the largest city in the United States without a map designating

06:48.182 --> 06:52.362
truck routes, which means that freight travel often cuts through residential neighborhoods.

06:52.426 --> 06:55.870
So in the coming year, the citywide Freight Map project

06:55.940 --> 06:59.374
will coordinate with council members and neighborhoods to secure some relief for

06:59.412 --> 07:02.558
them. And when it comes to increasing Houstonian's

07:02.574 --> 07:06.174
equity, we're still collaborating with the Kinder Institute on the Equity

07:06.222 --> 07:10.114
Indicators project to provide transparency, accountability and

07:10.152 --> 07:13.626
to refine operations for all city departments to increase

07:13.678 --> 07:17.574
equity across our city. The initial analysis is nearly completed but

07:17.612 --> 07:21.314
and the program will require ongoing management and measure to measure

07:21.362 --> 07:23.190
success in closing the gaps.

07:24.650 --> 07:28.374
Our ongoing work with neighborhood resiliency plans address storm recovery,

07:28.422 --> 07:32.406
watershed boundaries and other challenges like climate adaption, risk reduction,

07:32.518 --> 07:36.342
economic development, infrastructure modernization and social empowerment.

07:36.486 --> 07:40.042
Currently there are three plans to be completed by 2023, with another

07:40.096 --> 07:43.326
three to be completed afterward. And staff is developing a

07:43.348 --> 07:46.702
replicable framework for other neighborhoods to follow in creating their own

07:46.756 --> 07:49.998
resiliency plans. And our minimum lot size and

07:50.004 --> 07:53.806
minimum building line programs, which are so popular for neighborhoods, are reaching

07:53.838 --> 07:56.994
their 20 year threshold, which means

07:57.032 --> 08:00.962
that we're creating significant increase in we're getting requests for

08:01.016 --> 08:04.454
significant increase in renewals on top of the average projected new

08:04.492 --> 08:07.430
applications. And finally,

08:07.580 --> 08:10.070
historic preservation team we've created.

08:10.410 --> 08:14.006
Two new historic districts have been petitioned and we

08:14.028 --> 08:17.966
are working with the Economic Development Office for review and administration

08:18.018 --> 08:22.010
of the historic Site tax exemption program, which is growing in popularity.

08:22.910 --> 08:26.234
We expect conservation districts to presented to city Council within

08:26.272 --> 08:29.846
the next few months. A conservation district for Independence Heights will

08:29.888 --> 08:33.466
probably follow shortly thereafter. We see conservation districts

08:33.498 --> 08:37.018
as providing neighborhoods another tool for protecting their character.

08:37.194 --> 08:40.782
So I'm excited about all the partnerships we've forged and look forward

08:40.836 --> 08:43.120
to working with you on another collaborative year.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.626
Let's dig into the numbers now. The Planning and

08:46.648 --> 08:50.530
Development Department operates out of four separate funds. It's important

08:50.600 --> 08:54.110
to note, and I will discuss this in detail later, that while expenditures

08:54.190 --> 08:57.526
are specific to a fund's function, our team

08:57.548 --> 09:00.726
members operate in a silo free environment. In the

09:00.748 --> 09:04.246
Planning Department, it's talent, not titles, that informs the

09:04.268 --> 09:07.754
work of a team member does. And very few of our team members conduct one

09:07.792 --> 09:11.334
job within one fund. Most handle projects in multiple

09:11.382 --> 09:14.010
funds and we assign the costs accordingly.

09:14.510 --> 09:18.106
I'm telling you this because we stress importance of

09:18.128 --> 09:21.574
knowledge beyond their cubicle. It's my belief that this provides

09:21.622 --> 09:25.274
better professional training to our team and makes for a better city employee.

09:25.402 --> 09:28.846
The result is that we utilize a series of inner fund chargebacks and

09:28.868 --> 09:32.286
reimbursements that will seem confusing at first, but I'll explain them

09:32.308 --> 09:36.206
in detail as we get to them. So the first fund is the city's

09:36.238 --> 09:41.140
general fund. The FY 23 budget is $3,000,925

09:42.630 --> 09:46.358
$3,925,384

09:46.444 --> 09:49.510
with 23.1 full time equivalents.

09:49.850 --> 09:53.474
The fund supports our community engagement and transportation planning efforts

09:53.522 --> 09:56.200
as well as our management and customer support services.

09:56.970 --> 10:00.538
The second fund, the Department's Special Revenue Fund, supports the

10:00.544 --> 10:03.850
work of the majority of our team members. This fund receives

10:04.750 --> 10:07.930
fees from and pays for services related to

10:08.000 --> 10:11.414
land development activities within the 671 sq.

10:11.472 --> 10:15.242
Mi of the City of Houston, as well as the 1600 additional

10:15.306 --> 10:18.570
square miles in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction.

10:18.730 --> 10:22.802
The team at the permitting center are also on this fund. The third

10:22.856 --> 10:26.238
fund, the city's central services revolving fund also known

10:26.254 --> 10:30.082
as the Enterprise GIS or just simply Egis fund,

10:30.216 --> 10:33.774
supports the work of our GIS team located both at 611

10:33.822 --> 10:38.034
Walker and at the Houston Emergency center as a central service revolving

10:38.082 --> 10:41.394
fund operation. All expenditures in this area are charged

10:41.442 --> 10:45.426
back to the department that consume our services under their restricted accounts.

10:45.538 --> 10:51.370
The FY 23 budget is $1,736,847

10:51.520 --> 10:54.410
with 11.5 full time employees.

10:55.070 --> 10:58.682
And finally, the Historic Preservation Fund, which is a small fund used

10:58.736 --> 11:01.834
for nonpersonal special preservation activities that

11:01.872 --> 11:05.626
was created several years ago with the proceeds of the sale of some city owned

11:05.658 --> 11:09.342
historic fire stations. I'd like to take the time to discuss

11:09.396 --> 11:13.262
the programming and the core functions we handle in the Planning Department. Our department

11:13.326 --> 11:16.846
consists of seven divisions community and Regional Planning,

11:16.958 --> 11:19.778
transportation Planning, GIS Services,

11:19.944 --> 11:22.738
historic Preservation, Development Services,

11:22.904 --> 11:26.774
Management Services and the Director's Office for

11:26.812 --> 11:30.882
Community and Regional Planning. This group is led by Deputy Director Jennifer Austland

11:30.946 --> 11:34.866
and directly supports community planning with programs such as Complete Communities

11:34.978 --> 11:38.134
minimum Lot Size Building Line prohibited yard parking.

11:38.262 --> 11:42.150
They are also responsible for broader regional planning, such as annexations

11:42.230 --> 11:46.182
and changes to boundaries, including the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction.

11:46.326 --> 11:49.950
This group is the group currently working with you on Council Redistricting.

11:52.850 --> 11:56.874
The next division is Transportation planning. Led by David Fields, the city's Chief

11:56.922 --> 12:00.602
Transportation Planner, the division leads the city's

12:00.666 --> 12:05.006
systems level strategic Mobility planning. This function includes management

12:05.038 --> 12:09.154
of the city's Complete Streets and Transportation Plan, Vision Zero,

12:09.272 --> 12:13.042
the Major Thoroughfare and Freeway plan, the Houston Bike Plan,

12:13.176 --> 12:16.214
rail related planning, local area studies and

12:16.252 --> 12:19.110
external transportation funding and grant efforts.

12:19.770 --> 12:23.186
This is the team that's facilitating the discussions about the North Houston Highway

12:23.218 --> 12:26.694
Improvement Project, and some of our newest initiatives include

12:26.742 --> 12:30.742
connectivity studies for Houston neighborhoods the GIS

12:30.806 --> 12:34.118
Services Division. Led by Assistant Director Larry Nerth,

12:34.214 --> 12:37.978
this division manages and maintains much of the city's GIS information,

12:38.144 --> 12:41.718
provides and coordinates regional emergency providers with mapping and

12:41.744 --> 12:45.502
analysis for effective emergency services. As I often say,

12:45.556 --> 12:49.322
if you need an ambulance and it can find you, that's because our GIS

12:49.386 --> 12:53.106
group told it how to get there. This is also the group that provides the

12:53.128 --> 12:57.250
map indicating services, facilities and developments within your district.

12:58.070 --> 13:01.698
The next division is historic preservation. Roman McAllen is

13:01.704 --> 13:04.758
the city's Historic Preservation Officer and he leads this group.

13:04.844 --> 13:08.626
They facilitate the process of identifying and maintaining the city's historic

13:08.658 --> 13:12.082
resources through engagement with neighborhoods and property owners.

13:12.146 --> 13:16.158
This group manages certificates of appropriateness applications pertaining

13:16.194 --> 13:20.202
to Chapter 33 of the Code of Ordinances, as well as coordinating state

13:20.256 --> 13:24.502
and federal review of historic resources development

13:24.566 --> 13:28.102
services. Deputy Director Jennifer Austin leads this division

13:28.166 --> 13:31.514
also which oversees many development related activities including

13:31.562 --> 13:34.906
subdivision and development, platting and site plan review at the Houston

13:34.938 --> 13:38.666
Permitting Center. The last two are management

13:38.698 --> 13:42.322
Services and support the division responsible for operational support

13:42.376 --> 13:45.730
of the department, including budgeting, purchasing commission support,

13:45.880 --> 13:49.102
customer service and public information and open records.

13:49.166 --> 13:53.310
And then finally, the Director's Office, which handles all internal communications

13:53.390 --> 13:57.102
such as employee onboarding and training, as well as communications

13:57.166 --> 14:00.520
with the Mayor's office in your council, district offices and the public.

14:02.250 --> 14:05.494
Moving on to Revenues by Funds this

14:05.532 --> 14:09.526
slide is an overview of the proposed FY 23 revenue by fund in comparison

14:09.558 --> 14:13.334
to the department's estimated FY 22 revenue. Overall,

14:13.382 --> 14:16.938
we are proposing a revenue increase of 139,000

14:17.024 --> 14:21.254
across all funds focusing on the General Fund line.

14:21.392 --> 14:24.926
Revenue into the general fund is primarily from a chargeback from the

14:24.948 --> 14:28.026
department's special revenue fund. As I mentioned earlier,

14:28.138 --> 14:31.230
team members who are primarily paid out of the General Fund

14:31.300 --> 14:35.246
but spend some portion of their time working on development related activities

14:35.358 --> 14:39.346
that support the Special Revenue Fund. Their activities are

14:39.368 --> 14:43.438
reimbursed to the General Fund. The General Fund revenue is projected

14:43.454 --> 14:46.950
to increase by 77,000 or 5.5%

14:47.020 --> 14:50.406
from the FY 22 estimate. Moving on

14:50.428 --> 14:54.226
to the special revenue fund. This is Planning and Development special revenue

14:54.258 --> 14:57.446
fund dedicated to the department's development

14:57.478 --> 15:00.826
related services. These are services as a

15:00.848 --> 15:03.978
regulator to ensure orderly development in the city and our

15:04.064 --> 15:07.546
extraterritorial jurisdiction. They include functions such

15:07.568 --> 15:11.510
as the review of Platts, residential site plans and development plats,

15:11.590 --> 15:14.958
including work with the Planning Commission as well as our site plan review at the

15:14.964 --> 15:18.746
Houston Permitting Center. The Special Revenue Fund is funded with revenue

15:18.778 --> 15:22.734
from fees associated with these reviews and dedicates that revenue for services in

15:22.772 --> 15:26.654
support of development activity. A portion of that revenue

15:26.702 --> 15:30.306
is received by the Special Revenue Fund is due to team members who

15:30.328 --> 15:34.226
are primarily paid out of Special Revenue Fund but spend some portion of their

15:34.248 --> 15:37.970
time working on community engagement, transportation, planning efforts and management

15:38.050 --> 15:41.400
customer support activities that are technically General Fund.

15:41.850 --> 15:47.162
We expect a slight decrease in the revenue of 43,000 or

15:47.216 --> 15:51.962
4% 4%

15:52.016 --> 15:55.798
of this fund compared to FY 22 for fluctuations

15:55.814 --> 15:59.582
in revenue from various other sources. The next line shows

15:59.636 --> 16:03.402
Central Services revolving fund, also known as the Enterprise GIS.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.640
The fund provides critical mapping services to the city,

16:07.330 --> 16:10.734
including creation and maintenance of the city's underlying mapping data.

16:10.852 --> 16:13.966
The fund receives revenue from departments across the city to pay

16:13.988 --> 16:17.234
for GIS related services. The revenue to this fund is

16:17.272 --> 16:20.866
based on actual expenditures and as a result the revenue can go

16:20.888 --> 16:24.350
up or down depending on vacancies in the fund or other cost saving measures.

16:24.430 --> 16:28.070
This fund is expected to see a revenue increase of 107,000

16:28.140 --> 16:31.606
or 6.6% and the final fund is

16:31.628 --> 16:34.934
the Historic Preservation Fund. It was created by ordinance and is

16:34.972 --> 16:37.950
funded through the proceeds from the sale of historic fire stations.

16:38.050 --> 16:41.418
The purpose of this fund is to promote preservation and enhancement of the

16:41.424 --> 16:43.210
city's historic resources.

16:44.510 --> 16:48.342
The revenue to It is simply interest on the Fund balance and we're anticipating

16:48.406 --> 16:51.294
a 17% decrease in revenues this year.

16:51.492 --> 16:55.310
Overall, department revenues increase 139,000

16:55.380 --> 16:56.830
for all funds.

16:58.850 --> 17:02.146
Shifting to Expenditures this slide is an overview of the

17:02.168 --> 17:05.742
FY 2023 budgeted budget

17:05.806 --> 17:09.454
in comparison to the FY 22 projected current budget.

17:09.582 --> 17:18.230
Overall, we're proposing an expenditure decrease of approximately 1,546,000

17:18.300 --> 17:21.554
across all funds. Is that correct? The slide

17:21.602 --> 17:25.462
provides a quick overview of expenditures. General Fund

17:25.516 --> 17:28.810
we're proposing an increase of 14,000, or 0.4%.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.340
The increase is largely due to hope.

17:32.190 --> 17:35.898
To the Hope increase, Special Revenue Fund is proposed to have

17:35.904 --> 17:40.430
a decrease of 1,629,000

17:40.500 --> 17:43.678
or 12.1% resulting in a

17:43.684 --> 17:47.390
decrease from Indirect Cost and Consulting Services and

17:47.460 --> 17:50.782
Central Services Revolving Fund proposing an increase of 69,000

17:50.836 --> 17:54.066
or 4.1% resulting from Hope and increases in

17:54.088 --> 17:57.714
interfund charges. Finally, the Historic Preservation Fund has no

17:57.752 --> 17:58.340
change.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.184
This is the General Fund breakdown of

18:05.222 --> 18:08.476
expenditures. Personnel versus non

18:08.508 --> 18:11.932
personnel approximately 3.9 million in expenditures

18:11.996 --> 18:15.036
which includes 77% for personnel costs

18:15.068 --> 18:18.404
and 23% for non personnel cost in

18:18.442 --> 18:22.628
the non personal expenditures. The 887,000

18:22.714 --> 18:26.672
non personnel expenditure cost for the General Fund is broken

18:26.736 --> 18:30.016
down. The largest category is the restricted

18:30.048 --> 18:33.336
accounts. These expenses are not controlled by the Department and make up

18:33.358 --> 18:37.256
97% of the non personnel cost of this fund and

18:37.278 --> 18:40.872
then services and supplies about 33,000 or 3%

18:40.926 --> 18:42.920
of the non personnel expenditures.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.896
Next slide. This slide illustrates the projected

18:47.928 --> 18:51.672
budget expenditures for the Special Revenue Fund. The Fund's approximate

18:51.736 --> 18:55.484
11 million in expenditures includes 57% for

18:55.522 --> 18:59.088
personnel costs and 43% for non personnel cost

18:59.254 --> 19:02.876
in FY 23. The nonpersonal cost for the Department's Special Revenue

19:02.908 --> 19:07.280
Fund is as follows indirect cost recovery is 8%

19:07.350 --> 19:10.564
or 411,000. This cost is for

19:10.602 --> 19:14.084
indirect services provided by Central services departments and is not

19:14.122 --> 19:18.180
controlled by the Department. Interfund Services 29%

19:18.250 --> 19:21.504
is the chargeback that's paid to General Fund for development related

19:21.552 --> 19:25.336
activities that I mentioned earlier. Plat Tracker and

19:25.358 --> 19:28.776
Historic Tracker web Application Redesign I want to point out

19:28.798 --> 19:32.344
that this is a major expense this fund will see for the next several years.

19:32.462 --> 19:35.532
Plat Tracker, which is the primary portal through which all

19:35.586 --> 19:38.972
development related applications are submitted, is close to ten years

19:39.026 --> 19:41.950
old and is built on 13 year old technology.

19:42.320 --> 19:46.148
We've been working closely with It and Special Purchase and Strategic

19:46.184 --> 19:50.224
Purchasing for two years to develop an RFP for the reconstruction of

19:50.262 --> 19:53.500
this portal later this summer in June,

19:53.580 --> 19:57.660
you'll see a contract on your agenda to actually begin rebuilding

19:57.820 --> 20:01.756
this application. The restricted accounts

20:01.788 --> 20:05.952
is 17% of the non personnel cost and is not controlled by the Department and

20:06.006 --> 20:09.656
supplies and services is a combined 8% for

20:09.798 --> 20:14.360
supplies and services, computer supplies and so forth. Next slide

20:14.780 --> 20:18.116
the breakdown of the FY 23 expenditures for Central

20:18.148 --> 20:21.684
Services revolving fund. The fund's approximately

20:21.732 --> 20:25.288
1.7 million in expenditures includes 86%

20:25.374 --> 20:29.656
for personnel cost and 14% for non personnel costs

20:29.848 --> 20:33.580
in FY 23. The non personnel costs for the fund are broken down.

20:33.730 --> 20:37.448
49% includes various services and charges related to

20:37.474 --> 20:40.320
the fund, including technology, services and software.

20:41.220 --> 20:44.748
And then 40% of the non personnel cost in this fund is not controlled

20:44.764 --> 20:47.780
by the Department. Those are restricted accounts. And finally,

20:47.850 --> 20:52.340
11% is for computer supplies, offices, et cetera.

20:52.760 --> 20:56.624
Next slide. The breakdown of the proposed FY 23 expenditures

20:56.672 --> 21:01.316
for the Historic Preservation Fund include approximately 150,000

21:01.418 --> 21:05.176
in expenditures and is entirely for non personnel cost. There are

21:05.198 --> 21:09.124
no FTEs paid for out of this fund. The nonpersonal

21:09.172 --> 21:12.776
cost includes miscellaneous support services, which include

21:12.808 --> 21:16.856
funding for translation services for the Historic Commission meetings and the completion

21:16.888 --> 21:20.060
of the design guidelines for the historic areas in Houston.

21:23.200 --> 21:27.180
This slide shows our FY 23 projected fund balance

21:27.340 --> 21:31.200
I'm sorry projected General Fund budget expenditures net change

21:31.270 --> 21:34.960
to our FY 2022 projected current budget.

21:35.300 --> 21:38.800
The FY 23 projected current budget is 3.9 million.

21:38.870 --> 21:42.564
There's a one time operating budget adjustment for the position that was funded in

21:42.602 --> 21:45.972
FY 22 for the Office of Resilience and Sustainability that our

21:46.026 --> 21:49.792
Ara will now fund contractual or mandated adjustments

21:49.856 --> 21:53.796
of 115,000 that consist of the municipal pension reduction

21:53.908 --> 21:57.140
and an increase in the restricted accounts and hope pay increases

21:57.220 --> 22:00.570
resulting in an operating program increase of 15,000.

22:00.940 --> 22:04.204
This brings our FY 2023 projected budget to

22:04.242 --> 22:07.390
3.9 million or an increase of 0.4%.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.888
Any questions? Thank you for your presentation,

22:12.984 --> 22:16.476
council Member Alcorn. Thank you

22:16.498 --> 22:19.836
Chair. And thank you, Director, for all the great work you do at the Planning

22:19.868 --> 22:23.056
Department. Thanks for talking about Plat tracker. I was going to

22:23.078 --> 22:24.960
ask about the increase in management.

22:26.020 --> 22:29.888
I guess it's under the management consulting services. That's the

22:29.894 --> 22:33.812
big thing. And I know we we budgeted last year $2.6 million

22:33.866 --> 22:37.156
in that line item and spent $300,000. Can you just talk

22:37.178 --> 22:40.564
to me about that? Was it just delayed or

22:40.682 --> 22:43.704
were we expecting to spend that last year or what have you? We did expect

22:43.742 --> 22:47.450
to spend it last year, so about two years ago we started working with it

22:48.620 --> 22:52.632
on looking at how can we fix what we have because it is old,

22:52.766 --> 22:56.216
so let's just fix it. And it's answer was

22:56.398 --> 22:59.884
we really can't fix it. We need to really start from scratch. And so we

22:59.922 --> 23:03.276
expected it to be a shorter time frame in order to do the RFP and

23:03.298 --> 23:06.944
to get the money spent for rebuilding it. It actually took longer

23:07.142 --> 23:10.592
because we were more detailed. We went through a

23:10.646 --> 23:14.016
very robust conversation with

23:14.038 --> 23:18.860
the bidders on this and have developed an incredibly secure

23:18.940 --> 23:22.372
program that it supports that we're going to move forward

23:22.426 --> 23:26.164
with. The 300,000 that was spent last year was actually what

23:26.202 --> 23:29.552
led us to such a good resolution in that we had a contract

23:29.616 --> 23:33.744
with Gartner and Company to help us actually draft the RFP

23:33.872 --> 23:37.464
got it. And since they didn't bid on it and so that's like

23:37.502 --> 23:40.504
a lesser expense, the $1.9 million in the 2.6,

23:40.542 --> 23:43.576
do we expect there to be more in coming years towards this you said this

23:43.598 --> 23:46.876
will be a major expense for it'll be an expense for

23:46.898 --> 23:50.604
at least seven years. It is a one year implementation project with six

23:50.642 --> 23:54.590
years of full, virtually 24 hours support

23:54.960 --> 23:58.096
for our customers and for our staff. So we're very pleased with this

23:58.118 --> 24:01.248
process. Okay. And I've got some other questions about the

24:01.334 --> 24:04.512
primarily around the planning and development special revenue fund.

24:04.646 --> 24:08.630
You mentioned that some of the general fund employees support

24:09.160 --> 24:12.464
the efforts of that and vice versa.

24:12.512 --> 24:16.196
Some of the employees that are paid for through the Planning and

24:16.218 --> 24:20.292
Development Special Revenue Fund also do general fund functions and

24:20.346 --> 24:24.008
vice versa. Okay. I guess my question is,

24:24.174 --> 24:27.304
was that the intent of putting the I mean, was it was

24:27.342 --> 24:30.904
it all was it supposed to be the Planning and Development Special Revenue Fund over

24:30.942 --> 24:34.556
at permitting was supposed to just support those efforts, or was it

24:34.578 --> 24:37.724
always meant to be fluid? Well,

24:37.842 --> 24:42.076
so when the fund was created so

24:42.098 --> 24:45.808
the fees are for land development activities that the

24:45.814 --> 24:49.136
City of Houston does, whether it's Platting or permitting over at

24:49.158 --> 24:52.528
the permitting center. So the fund

24:52.614 --> 24:56.204
supports those activities, but it also supports

24:56.252 --> 25:00.176
some development related activities, such as a few positions

25:00.208 --> 25:04.176
that do minimum lot size designations, because those are development related.

25:04.288 --> 25:07.572
It supports some of our transportation planning. And as

25:07.626 --> 25:11.136
we have worked with this fund for three years, what we've

25:11.168 --> 25:14.852
been able to determine is that some team members specialties

25:14.916 --> 25:19.736
really afford them. They have the best skills and the best ability to

25:19.758 --> 25:23.176
do a type of service such as outreach. Some of

25:23.198 --> 25:26.616
that outreach will be development related, some of it won't

25:26.648 --> 25:30.364
be. And so that's why we charge back and

25:30.402 --> 25:34.316
reimburse the funds, is because if, say, for instance, one of our

25:34.338 --> 25:36.540
planners is terrific at outreach,

25:37.600 --> 25:40.896
she will work with the development side work as well

25:40.918 --> 25:44.096
as the non development side. And we need to make sure we're clear on

25:44.118 --> 25:47.372
which fund pays her. Okay, I have some more if you put me back in.

25:47.446 --> 25:51.204
Did I answer your question? Yes. Okay, let's be mindful. We're about

25:51.242 --> 25:53.460
45 minutes behind schedule.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.260
Council Member Cayman,

25:58.520 --> 26:02.170
I'm happy to defer to Council Member Alcorn if she wants to wrap up.

26:09.220 --> 26:12.864
All right, Director, first off,

26:13.062 --> 26:15.696
I know you all are dealing with a lot right now. And then on top

26:15.718 --> 26:19.216
of that, to throw in redistricting. I don't

26:19.238 --> 26:23.236
know how you all are doing it all, but thank you. And again.

26:23.418 --> 26:26.628
David Fields. So many others. I'm not

26:26.634 --> 26:30.256
going to start naming people because I'll get in trouble. But whether it's in District

26:30.288 --> 26:34.040
C, the Historic districts, the Heritage District,

26:34.940 --> 26:38.568
Vision Zero's Implementation, I'm so excited to hear about the

26:38.574 --> 26:41.832
new freight mapping. I think that's going to be a very big deal,

26:41.886 --> 26:43.450
especially in District C.

26:45.100 --> 26:48.684
On top of all of that, any meeting my constituents have asked for,

26:48.802 --> 26:52.044
you and your staff have been to. So thank you for being

26:52.082 --> 26:55.772
available to our residents for all of their questions. In times

26:55.826 --> 26:59.216
of great concern and need. One of the concerns I just

26:59.238 --> 27:02.656
want to continue to raise and elevate in any way

27:02.678 --> 27:05.760
that I can. I know as a city we have to build denser,

27:06.580 --> 27:10.724
we have to have affordable housing, we have to make it convenient for

27:10.762 --> 27:14.784
people in parts of the district. I continue to be concerned

27:14.912 --> 27:18.416
about, for example, in Shady Acres, in Lazy Brook Timbergrove,

27:18.448 --> 27:22.272
but especially Shady Acres that as we're building hyper

27:22.336 --> 27:26.404
densely, we still don't have the infrastructure to mitigate

27:26.452 --> 27:30.596
and manage all of the building that's going on. So I know that's

27:30.628 --> 27:34.156
not a question. I just, on behalf of residents, have to continue to

27:34.258 --> 27:38.088
emphasize the need to as we build dense

27:38.184 --> 27:41.356
that we're building responsibly. And I know you take that charge very

27:41.458 --> 27:45.724
seriously as it relates to the department itself.

27:45.842 --> 27:49.244
May I respond to that for a moment? We do take it very seriously

27:49.292 --> 27:53.248
and I think that our Livable Places Action Committee is working very hard

27:53.334 --> 27:57.040
and very intently on fixing some of that. But I also want to say

27:57.110 --> 28:00.724
that our partnership with the Houston Public Works Department is better

28:00.762 --> 28:05.168
than it has ever been. And so the work that we're doing with development

28:05.344 --> 28:08.852
and developers and property owners in the city is

28:08.906 --> 28:12.136
really being amplified by the work that they're doing in the

28:12.158 --> 28:15.956
general I'm sorry, in the Chief

28:15.988 --> 28:19.556
Engineer's office. And the partnership is really putting forth

28:19.668 --> 28:23.396
ideas for a better Houston and I couldn't

28:23.428 --> 28:27.004
agree more. So, again, I appreciate that and really look forward to the

28:27.042 --> 28:30.910
additional measures and improvements as they come along really quickly.

28:31.600 --> 28:35.420
Future needs of the department. Again, tight budget,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.956
what do we need to be on the lookout for or be aware of that's

28:38.988 --> 28:42.864
not being satisfied by this current budget this year. So we

28:42.902 --> 28:46.796
anticipate future needs of the department include, besides special revenue

28:46.828 --> 28:51.380
fund activities, some general fund activities that could be that

28:51.530 --> 28:54.836
conservation District working with the Conservation District is

28:54.858 --> 28:58.164
a new program we're creating this year. We also would like to do

28:58.202 --> 29:02.228
more resiliency plans for neighborhoods that would take more team members.

29:02.314 --> 29:05.512
And we believe that the tools we have in place,

29:05.566 --> 29:09.592
such as minimum lot size and minimum building line, are very good

29:09.646 --> 29:13.564
for neighborhoods and they very much want to opt into them. Having the number

29:13.602 --> 29:16.460
of people who can support that has been difficult recently.

29:18.080 --> 29:21.870
Council Member Alcorn, as you mentioned, Director, you have

29:22.640 --> 29:26.152
really increased the number of plans you're reviewing over at the permitting center.

29:26.226 --> 29:30.880
So I noticed in your budget, it looks like going to get two more FTEs

29:31.220 --> 29:34.816
in development design review, one more in

29:34.838 --> 29:37.936
development services, three more in development support services.

29:38.038 --> 29:41.696
Do you think that that's sufficient to I noticed in today's

29:41.888 --> 29:45.284
dashboard you've got about 1900 plans in

29:45.322 --> 29:48.740
planning at about 27 days. I know you're working towards a goal of

29:48.810 --> 29:52.696
13 days for commercial, ten days for residential. So do you think

29:52.718 --> 29:56.264
you need more people there to tackle the great number of

29:56.302 --> 30:00.410
increase in plans. I think that right now we are seeing

30:00.940 --> 30:04.040
such an immense increase in the plans that, yes,

30:04.110 --> 30:06.830
right now I could use double the team,

30:07.280 --> 30:10.844
but I have to be really cautious because the Special Revenue Fund is

30:10.882 --> 30:14.060
a self fulfilling fund. It is not like right.

30:14.130 --> 30:17.564
Not like the general fund. It comes from the fees

30:17.612 --> 30:21.024
that we collect and we have this

30:21.062 --> 30:24.704
huge expense for Plat tracker. And so as that works its way

30:24.742 --> 30:28.736
out to you for approval over the next month, once I

30:28.758 --> 30:32.196
get that number nailed down, I'll be able to analyze where I can

30:32.218 --> 30:36.272
go and how I can increase funding at a much more safe

30:36.416 --> 30:40.320
way. So that's when I'll take that step. Does your department offer customer

30:40.410 --> 30:44.312
paid expediting? Yes, we do expedite. Can you describe that

30:44.446 --> 30:48.056
to me a little bit? So if

30:48.078 --> 30:52.250
a customer asks for expedited review and pays it

30:52.780 --> 30:56.600
by 09:00 a.m. That morning, I believe

30:56.670 --> 31:00.332
we have the plan out for them within 24 hours

31:00.386 --> 31:03.292
of the 24 hours from the time they pay the fee, I believe.

31:03.346 --> 31:06.796
Does the charge depend on the complexity of the project or is

31:06.818 --> 31:09.968
it a flat? Council Member, can I get back to you? Sure, absolutely. Thank you

31:09.974 --> 31:13.376
very much. Thank you,

31:13.398 --> 31:17.212
Director and Mr. Hamilton for your presentation. You all are now dismissed.

31:17.276 --> 31:20.640
Thank you. We will now begin the public comment period.

31:20.720 --> 31:24.692
We will start with our virtual speakers. Please press star six

31:24.746 --> 31:28.500
to unmute when you hear your name. The first speaker is Saba Blandy.

31:29.720 --> 31:33.208
Hey, good afternoon. I just had two quick questions for this

31:33.294 --> 31:37.044
department. I appreciate the expansion to the High Comfort

31:37.092 --> 31:40.964
Bicycle Network, and I was curious what the overall timeline of expansion

31:41.012 --> 31:45.084
was. And I was also curious, as somebody who lives near

31:45.122 --> 31:49.100
a bus stop, if there's a plan to make sidewalks near public transit

31:49.520 --> 31:52.670
Ada accessible, because the ones near ours are not.

31:54.960 --> 31:58.348
So we'll need to get back to

31:58.354 --> 32:01.536
you on question one. So if you want to send that to District E

32:01.558 --> 32:04.880
at houstontx Gov, we'll get you a specific response on that.

32:04.950 --> 32:06.690
As it pertains to question two?

32:08.100 --> 32:12.004
As it pertains to question two, yes, I believe there is a

32:12.042 --> 32:16.496
strategy in place to provide sidewalks and Ada accessibility

32:16.608 --> 32:20.208
for Metro bus stops in those areas.

32:20.304 --> 32:23.576
And there are some plans that are in the works that our

32:23.598 --> 32:27.636
offices are collaborating with Metro. I know in District

32:27.668 --> 32:31.460
J we did a recent initiative with Metro

32:31.620 --> 32:35.020
regarding our bus stops, and they were very intentional on

32:35.090 --> 32:38.396
finding bus stops with proper sidewalks and

32:38.418 --> 32:42.476
Ada accessibility. So that is on

32:42.498 --> 32:46.012
our radar. That is a priority for us to continue to look at and

32:46.066 --> 32:50.240
be able to be mindful to try to get as many bus stops

32:50.980 --> 32:54.736
up to date with those type of amenities as possible around the

32:54.758 --> 32:58.032
city. So if you see one in your area, wherever you are

32:58.086 --> 33:01.696
in your district, try to advocate for that. Reach out to your district.

33:01.728 --> 33:04.150
Council Member and stay engaged with us.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.516
Absolutely. Thank you. Council Member David Robinson. Thank you,

33:08.538 --> 33:13.284
Chair, and Ms. Blanding, thank you again for being here so alertly

33:13.332 --> 33:16.808
with our panels. And in this case, I think

33:16.894 --> 33:20.824
I'd like to call your attention to the city's website for the

33:20.862 --> 33:24.364
TTI committee briefings. Recently, there has been a

33:24.402 --> 33:28.024
presentation, yes, by planning, but also in conjunction

33:28.072 --> 33:32.360
with the Mayor's Office for persons with disabilities. Director Gabe Costarez

33:32.520 --> 33:36.204
has addressed some of those things. And I think that the

33:36.242 --> 33:39.724
video recording of that you would find interesting and perhaps

33:39.772 --> 33:43.824
helpful. And if you need a reference to where within the

33:43.862 --> 33:47.264
presentation that content occurred, my office can help you.

33:47.302 --> 33:50.404
If you reach out to the AtLarge two office for that.

33:50.442 --> 33:54.180
So I appreciate the good questions and your ongoing attendance.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.390
Thank you so much.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.340
Amanda psy.

34:04.230 --> 34:06.370
Please press star six to unmute.

34:14.470 --> 34:17.650
Amanda Sigh, please press star six to unmute.

34:20.150 --> 34:20.900
Hello.

34:25.990 --> 34:29.800
I'm not prepared right now, so I'll go ahead and yield my time.

34:31.690 --> 34:33.270
Mr. Jason oliver.

34:37.550 --> 34:41.318
Hello, and thank you to the Planning Department

34:41.414 --> 34:45.222
for the Redistricting website is really valuable.

34:45.366 --> 34:48.726
It has a lot of resources. It's been helpful for me trying

34:48.768 --> 34:52.494
to understand this and the language accessibility there.

34:52.532 --> 34:56.490
I'm wondering if there's a centralized online place where the CIP

34:56.650 --> 35:01.050
kind of information is being shared during these meetings are all accessible.

35:01.210 --> 35:04.190
That's a whole separate budget adoption.

35:04.270 --> 35:07.406
That's much hard to navigate. And I feel like it's kind of falling

35:07.438 --> 35:11.310
under the radar with all that's happening with Redistricting.

35:11.470 --> 35:15.390
And then second, as the city transitions to outcomes based budgeting,

35:15.470 --> 35:18.774
the Finance Department told us that planning would be the group

35:18.812 --> 35:22.386
to facilitate public engagement around it. So what existing

35:22.418 --> 35:25.926
plans are in action and how can we enhance the budget process to

35:25.948 --> 35:29.546
encourage engagement? For example, holding workshops before the

35:29.568 --> 35:33.210
proposed budget is released and extending the timeline so that there's more opportunity

35:33.360 --> 35:36.060
and it's not kind of rushed in the way that it is now.

35:37.310 --> 35:40.146
Council Member David Robinson. Yes. Mr. Oliver,

35:40.198 --> 35:43.470
thanks again for your good question. I think with regard to the

35:43.540 --> 35:46.602
activities of the CIP programs,

35:46.666 --> 35:50.074
we have the last meeting tonight. As I'm sure you're aware, the District

35:50.122 --> 35:54.446
B office and our District B meeting

35:54.478 --> 35:58.386
is this evening. But I think your question is a good one to get all

35:58.408 --> 36:01.858
of those activities consolidated in a place on the

36:01.864 --> 36:05.174
web. So I'm interested in following up with you. Of course,

36:05.212 --> 36:08.566
that relates to activities, as you said, central to the

36:08.588 --> 36:11.558
Finance Department as well as to public works.

36:11.724 --> 36:15.302
So to have some kind of centralized location for that

36:15.356 --> 36:18.698
CIP information, let's see what we can do to help you on

36:18.704 --> 36:21.830
that one. Okay. And additionally jason.

36:21.910 --> 36:25.830
Thank you. We are working to schedule our CIP

36:25.910 --> 36:29.466
special call BFA meeting in June. So after we

36:29.488 --> 36:33.306
go through the budget presentations as a committee, we will

36:33.328 --> 36:36.586
take up the CIP and present that to the public so

36:36.608 --> 36:39.722
you can stay engaged with the process through that way as well.

36:39.776 --> 36:43.250
So we'll put the information out on that shortly.

36:44.550 --> 36:48.370
Thank you. That completes our public

36:48.440 --> 36:48.830
speakers.
