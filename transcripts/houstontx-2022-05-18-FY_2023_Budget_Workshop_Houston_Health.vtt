WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:03.600
Airport system. We will now transition to

00:05.170 --> 00:09.226
Houston Health and Director

00:09.258 --> 00:13.354
Williams director

00:13.402 --> 00:17.146
Stephen Williams and Darren Asher and council

00:17.178 --> 00:20.990
member, pilot, vice chair. Would you step in the seat, council Member Jackson,

00:22.210 --> 00:23.310
1 minute.

01:10.390 --> 01:14.254
At this time, I want to welcome director Stephen Williams and Darren

01:14.302 --> 01:18.370
Asher to provide the Houston Health Department budget. The floor is yours.

01:21.610 --> 01:25.666
Good afternoon. As you said, I'm Stephen

01:25.698 --> 01:29.222
Williams, director of the Houston Health Department. I'm here to

01:29.276 --> 01:33.270
present our General Fund and Special Fund budget for

01:33.340 --> 01:37.526
the fiscal year 2023. I want to start by introducing

01:37.558 --> 01:40.220
my staff there behind me, so I don't know where they are.

01:40.910 --> 01:44.266
I have with me Judy Harris, who's Chief of Staff and

01:44.368 --> 01:48.826
deputy director. Also Darren

01:48.858 --> 01:52.538
Asher, who's our chief financial officer and administration.

01:52.634 --> 01:56.414
Also is Amber Hague, who's behind me, also who does

01:56.452 --> 01:58.110
one part of our administration.

01:59.670 --> 02:03.470
Stepping in for our communications officer is Dr. Faith Foreman,

02:03.630 --> 02:06.850
who's administratively over that unit right now.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.110
But you should be familiar with portfolio Villarrell,

02:10.190 --> 02:13.670
who is our Pio and Councilor Liaison.

02:14.490 --> 02:18.306
Also with me is my assistant, Randy Presley assistant

02:18.338 --> 02:22.450
Director, Patrick Key, over Environmental Naomi Macys,

02:22.610 --> 02:26.122
assistant Director for Clinical and Multi Service Center

02:26.176 --> 02:29.706
Operations, Dr. Shannon Bivens, the Deputy Director for Public Health,

02:29.808 --> 02:34.634
Evelyn Schaefer, deputy Director of Human Services and

02:34.752 --> 02:38.410
Financial Division Manager, Shamika Marshall

02:38.930 --> 02:42.366
I want to express publicly my gratitude for the

02:42.388 --> 02:46.126
staff, especially during the last two and a half years. Although for

02:46.148 --> 02:49.540
you all, things might seem relatively calm in the community.

02:49.910 --> 02:53.454
With rates of COVID slowly rising, we're still providing

02:53.502 --> 02:56.658
testing and vaccination services to the community.

02:56.824 --> 03:00.674
At the same time, we're resetting these services that we

03:00.712 --> 03:04.514
have within the Houston Health Department and transitioning

03:04.562 --> 03:08.166
to what we would call possibly a new normal. But I don't

03:08.188 --> 03:12.086
know that any of us really knows what that is. Now go

03:12.108 --> 03:15.770
to the next slide, please, with vision, mission and goals.

03:16.990 --> 03:20.826
Our mission is to work in partnership with the community to promote and protect the

03:20.848 --> 03:24.780
health and social well being of Houstonians and the environment in which they live.

03:25.790 --> 03:30.106
It's not practical to try to do public health alone. Community involvement

03:30.138 --> 03:34.094
is key to our success. Our partnerships were certainly instrumental in our

03:34.132 --> 03:37.710
ongoing COVID response, certainly related to testing and

03:37.780 --> 03:41.902
vaccinations and the critical for effective

03:41.966 --> 03:46.194
interventions within the community. We don't think that we

03:46.232 --> 03:49.822
can do it all. We exist in public health to improve

03:49.886 --> 03:53.618
access to care, to prevent spread of infectious disease

03:53.714 --> 03:57.074
to promote opportunities for healthy living and reduce burden

03:57.122 --> 04:00.966
of chronic disease which most people die from protect the

04:00.988 --> 04:04.234
community from environmental hazards to improve health and well

04:04.272 --> 04:07.494
being through human services improve health of mothers,

04:07.542 --> 04:11.318
infants and children and prepare to respond to disasters

04:11.414 --> 04:15.142
and emergencies. And certainly we try to do that in a culture

04:15.206 --> 04:17.600
of excellence. Next slide, please.

04:19.730 --> 04:23.374
This is our functional organizational chart. In our General Fund,

04:23.412 --> 04:26.734
it supports 374 positions. Within our

04:26.772 --> 04:30.318
Special Funds, it supports 285 positions

04:30.414 --> 04:33.842
which totals about 660 FPS between

04:33.896 --> 04:38.434
those two funds. Our administration, I'll tell you, is just 9.9%

04:38.552 --> 04:41.858
of the General Fund, especially funds.

04:41.954 --> 04:45.394
But I have to add in our grant funds. Our grant funds

04:45.522 --> 04:49.366
support 675 positions and this

04:49.388 --> 04:53.190
is not including COVID sources.

04:54.170 --> 04:57.690
Those funds are approximately $63 million.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.538
That will be a total for normal operations of about 1336

05:02.624 --> 05:07.034
FTEs for Florida department administration is 7.6%

05:07.072 --> 05:11.182
of that. Well, we have COVID with the $91 million

05:11.236 --> 05:15.502
that we have annually for COVID. You need to add another 485

05:15.556 --> 05:19.502
positions to that, bringing our total positions within the health department

05:19.566 --> 05:23.570
now to 1821 for the entire department.

05:24.870 --> 05:28.562
Administration of all of that is still reduced to

05:28.616 --> 05:31.974
6.3% of our budget. And I say that because

05:32.172 --> 05:35.800
without administration we can't really get the job done.

05:36.570 --> 05:40.662
I'm extremely proud of the scope of the programs and services

05:40.796 --> 05:44.274
that we provide. Although in some of our programs

05:44.322 --> 05:47.850
I do not believe that the scale in programs like our Don,

05:47.920 --> 05:51.274
our Reentry program, see to Succeed, our scale should

05:51.312 --> 05:54.490
certainly be much broader to match the scale of the problem

05:54.560 --> 05:57.886
of the condition that exists here in the city of

05:57.908 --> 06:01.242
Houston. The next slide is a summary

06:01.306 --> 06:05.150
of our major services. Did something different this year?

06:05.300 --> 06:08.930
I wanted to give you an idea of how much the General Fund

06:09.000 --> 06:12.580
supports public health within this community.

06:13.910 --> 06:16.802
If you look at the services that are highlighted in green,

06:16.856 --> 06:21.074
you will see that our General Fund primarily supports environmental

06:21.122 --> 06:24.850
health, which has food safety, special waste and pools.

06:24.930 --> 06:28.098
Our clinical services out of four health centers,

06:28.274 --> 06:31.400
eleven multi service centers, and hopefully in

06:32.170 --> 06:35.226
the 2023 budget year we'll add on a

06:35.248 --> 06:38.650
leaf and with a new Sunnyside facility, thank God,

06:38.800 --> 06:42.678
and a regional lab. But if you look at those programs

06:42.694 --> 06:46.702
that are in red, there's limited or no General Fund support for those

06:46.756 --> 06:50.302
programs. TB, Immunizations, Maternal and Child

06:50.356 --> 06:54.446
Health C to Succeed, which provides free vision exams and

06:54.468 --> 06:57.818
glasses to children. My brother's keeper reentry.

06:57.914 --> 07:01.086
Certainly WIC is a grant funded program. All of our COVID

07:01.118 --> 07:05.406
operations and testing and vaccine is supported by grants. The programs

07:05.438 --> 07:08.974
that I did mention are primarily supported through grants and special revenue

07:09.022 --> 07:11.060
funds. Next slide, please.

07:15.210 --> 07:18.718
This slide lists state and local codes and ordinance that mandates

07:18.754 --> 07:22.566
some of the public health services that we provide, such as Disease Prevention

07:22.598 --> 07:25.846
and Control, environmental Regulatory service and vital statistics.

07:25.958 --> 07:29.278
Chapter One and 121. The Public Health Reorganization Act

07:29.364 --> 07:33.230
authorizes municipalities to enforce laws to protect public health,

07:33.300 --> 07:36.942
receive grants, appoint a local health authority. And that would be Dr.

07:36.996 --> 07:40.386
David Purse. Our local ordinances, chapter 21 and

07:40.408 --> 07:43.662
22 establishes the local health department.

07:43.806 --> 07:47.598
Subsequent ordinances establish certain programs such as air pollution

07:47.694 --> 07:50.254
and vital statistics. Next slide,

07:50.302 --> 07:53.426
please. The medical nature of

07:53.448 --> 07:57.282
our operations requires specialized licenses and certification.

07:57.426 --> 08:01.126
This has a major impact on recruitment intention given our proximity to

08:01.148 --> 08:04.822
the medical center. As I mentioned in the past, our department

08:04.886 --> 08:07.878
was the first health department in Texas to become accredited.

08:07.974 --> 08:11.494
We was the second major city in the country to become Fab

08:11.542 --> 08:16.134
accredited during the Pandemic. We became reaccredited,

08:16.182 --> 08:20.080
and we are accredited for the next five years to 2026.

08:20.450 --> 08:24.346
With the accreditation, hopefully we can demonstrate increased accountability

08:24.538 --> 08:28.334
and credibility to the public, to the funders, certainly to you and

08:28.452 --> 08:31.460
partner organizations which we work with.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.780
Next slide, please.

08:36.070 --> 08:39.762
Licenses and certification that are required. Our business requires certain

08:39.816 --> 08:44.290
licenses and certification, as you can see the

08:44.360 --> 08:47.954
requirements for a laboratory and pharmacy. I want to highlight

08:48.002 --> 08:52.190
that our lab does not only support our clinics, but it's a specialty lab supporting

08:52.290 --> 08:56.522
17 surrounding counties. Our stat lab provides onsite lab

08:56.576 --> 08:59.542
testing and our specific multi service clinics.

08:59.686 --> 09:03.146
The Bureau of Laboratory Services provide a variety of clinical and

09:03.168 --> 09:07.002
environmental testing and support of various health department

09:07.066 --> 09:10.618
programs, including our lead TB, Epidemiology,

09:10.714 --> 09:13.470
Environmental Services, Hi V. STD.

09:14.370 --> 09:18.030
Our wastewater surveillance. And I want to really highlight wastewater

09:18.110 --> 09:21.966
surveillance because it has really gotten

09:21.998 --> 09:25.810
national attention. It's a partnership with Rice thanks

09:25.880 --> 09:29.914
to Carol Hednock and Public Works and her folks are very cooperative

09:29.982 --> 09:33.750
during the Pandemic having their staff actually collecting those samples.

09:35.290 --> 09:39.794
We have actually been a source of support for other jurisdictions

09:39.842 --> 09:43.510
within the country that are wanting to get into wastewater

09:43.590 --> 09:46.170
testing because they see ours as a model,

09:46.320 --> 09:50.726
given that the Public Works wastewater

09:50.838 --> 09:55.406
system as it exists within the

09:55.428 --> 09:59.274
city. Of course, with wastewater surveillance,

09:59.322 --> 10:03.134
we're able to predict COVID-19 trends from one to two weeks

10:03.252 --> 10:07.050
before other surveillance metrics like testing.

10:07.210 --> 10:10.642
And of course, we use that information to guide our

10:10.696 --> 10:14.370
strategies related to COVID. I have to tell you

10:14.440 --> 10:17.714
that even though the numbers are low now,

10:17.752 --> 10:21.510
we're still concerned with several geographical areas within

10:21.580 --> 10:25.094
the city where there are low vaccination rates coupled with

10:25.132 --> 10:27.778
other social economic challenges.

10:27.874 --> 10:31.400
Hopefully you will be seeing a number of

10:31.770 --> 10:35.050
contracts where we're trying to partner with more community

10:35.120 --> 10:39.098
based organizations to have further reach into those specific

10:39.184 --> 10:42.858
communities. The next slide, please. I have been doing

10:42.944 --> 10:46.574
this presentation for about 18 years, and I have to always do

10:46.612 --> 10:50.094
this slide just to highlight the

10:50.132 --> 10:53.082
level of investment, the general fund investment,

10:53.226 --> 10:57.366
and the health department. Overall. This slide

10:57.418 --> 11:01.042
illustrates the city's net fund general fund investment in public

11:01.096 --> 11:03.940
health. It's only for $40 million.

11:05.030 --> 11:08.434
The Health Department's 23 target is $65

11:08.472 --> 11:11.862
million. 2 million of that is to cover environmental health

11:11.916 --> 11:15.046
special revenue funds. But please understand that

11:15.068 --> 11:18.694
we generate $25.6 million in

11:18.732 --> 11:21.970
revenue. That's where we get that number from.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.418
But it's also to note that out of $40 million

11:25.584 --> 11:26.570
investment,

11:28.110 --> 11:31.786
19 million is in restricted funds, which means that

11:31.808 --> 11:36.062
I only have control of $20 million in general fund

11:36.196 --> 11:40.814
to really do public health programming and

11:40.852 --> 11:45.806
that's of a budget of $165,000,000

11:45.908 --> 11:49.266
totally if you include our grants and

11:49.288 --> 11:53.406
other special funds. The next slide,

11:53.438 --> 11:57.362
please. Our revenues by Fund Fund

11:57.416 --> 12:00.966
100 represents an increase of $3 million in

12:00.988 --> 12:04.674
revenue, and it's related to multiple grants in support of COVID-19

12:04.722 --> 12:08.898
that are generating additional indirect cost recovery.

12:08.994 --> 12:12.834
When we bring in grants, we hire people, we actually increase

12:12.882 --> 12:16.140
the bottom line of the General Fund because of indirect cost.

12:16.830 --> 12:20.346
This revenue is driven directly by our

12:20.368 --> 12:24.086
ability to hire grant staff, which means the more grant staff

12:24.118 --> 12:27.902
we hire, the more indirect dollars we can actually draw down

12:27.956 --> 12:32.542
from the grants. In Fund 22,

12:32.676 --> 12:35.934
an increase of approximately $2 million reflects a one

12:35.972 --> 12:39.758
time transfer from the General Fund to cover our environmental

12:39.774 --> 12:42.210
health experience expenses.

12:42.870 --> 12:46.690
This program staff activity actually generate enough

12:46.760 --> 12:50.290
revenue to cover the program expenses.

12:50.710 --> 12:54.350
Fund 2010 represents a reduction of approximately

12:54.430 --> 12:58.214
$3.1 million in revenue due to the 1115

12:58.332 --> 13:02.054
waiver actually coming to an end, we are slated to get

13:02.092 --> 13:05.420
our last payment in July of this year.

13:06.030 --> 13:09.258
Overall, in our budget you will see an increase in revenue of

13:09.264 --> 13:11.100
$2.2 billion.

13:13.150 --> 13:17.434
The next slide actually is a highlight of the

13:17.472 --> 13:20.718
summary of revenue by Fund. I'm not going to go over that because if you

13:20.724 --> 13:24.574
go to the next slide, I can actually talk more specifically about those

13:24.612 --> 13:27.722
funds and Fund 100,

13:27.796 --> 13:31.410
the expenditure breakdown. Of course, 60% of the General

13:31.480 --> 13:34.162
Fund supports personnel for administrative services,

13:34.296 --> 13:38.510
environmental health, oral health and clinical staff, and the health Clinics

13:38.590 --> 13:42.680
laboratory Morality Service Centers. It's really a repeat of what I said before.

13:43.370 --> 13:47.350
40% of the General Fund supports non personnel items.

13:47.770 --> 13:51.826
Of that, I'd just like to note that only 18% of the non personnel funds

13:51.858 --> 13:55.482
support departmental operations. We primarily rely on

13:55.536 --> 13:59.818
grant and special revenue funds to make ends meet

13:59.984 --> 14:03.046
when it comes to buying equipment,

14:03.158 --> 14:05.360
supplies and services.

14:07.890 --> 14:12.042
The next slide, please. Expenditures by Funds

14:12.186 --> 14:15.790
this slide is a summary, so I'm going to go to the next page,

14:15.940 --> 14:20.094
which breaks it down by detail. All funds

14:20.142 --> 14:23.746
highlight expenditure highlights. In Fund 1000,

14:23.848 --> 14:27.730
expenditures increased by $5.5 million

14:27.800 --> 14:31.126
due to $1.2 million in hope and

14:31.148 --> 14:34.822
pension increases. $1.6 million for

14:34.876 --> 14:38.710
new a leaf facility, which only represents

14:39.210 --> 14:42.730
the third time in 18 years that I've actually gotten General

14:42.800 --> 14:46.234
Fund money for programs in public health. The only

14:46.272 --> 14:49.866
other two times was when we

14:49.888 --> 14:53.866
needed more overtime in jail health, which was

14:53.968 --> 14:57.502
a mandated services, and we got a cut in

14:57.556 --> 15:01.406
federal dollars for our TB services and we needed to backfill some of

15:01.428 --> 15:04.766
those dollars. So I'm grateful. Even though it's the third time in

15:04.788 --> 15:08.862
18 years. Fund 2002

15:08.996 --> 15:12.642
increases include additional funds for expansion of our AAA

15:12.696 --> 15:17.042
Veterans Affairs program. Of course, that's grant funded funds in 2008

15:17.096 --> 15:21.382
2009 there were no significant changes, and funds in 2010

15:21.436 --> 15:24.646
no significant changes. But as I said, we're getting that

15:24.668 --> 15:28.118
last payment for that in July of this year.

15:28.284 --> 15:32.146
Fund 2023 Special Waste Fund reflects

15:32.178 --> 15:35.594
the transfer eleven FTEs to the Health Special Revenue Fund

15:35.792 --> 15:40.166
from 2002 as part of the department's

15:40.198 --> 15:43.290
attempt to reduce expenditures.

15:44.270 --> 15:48.254
Really, this is really charging a portion of consumer health

15:48.292 --> 15:52.234
staff to this Fund. The next slide,

15:52.282 --> 15:52.880
please.

15:56.570 --> 16:00.714
Personnel versus non personnel in Fund 22.

16:00.912 --> 16:04.746
This is a catch. All fund used to manage revenue that is generated for

16:04.768 --> 16:08.758
a variety of programs. This includes Environmental

16:08.934 --> 16:12.686
Consumer Health RFID program, which is

16:12.708 --> 16:17.086
really the RFIDs that you have on the

16:17.108 --> 16:20.398
food trucks. Our Veterans Affairs that I

16:20.404 --> 16:23.722
mentioned earlier, medicaid Administrative Claiming,

16:23.786 --> 16:27.158
which is really based on a cost report that we are due

16:27.194 --> 16:30.926
for providing services related to Medicaid

16:31.118 --> 16:35.170
clients and also vital records and parking garage fees.

16:35.990 --> 16:39.190
54% of all funds support personnel.

16:40.010 --> 16:43.670
This is related to the issuance of ambulance permitting support

16:43.740 --> 16:47.334
the Veterans Administration program by assisting veterans with

16:47.372 --> 16:51.130
services staffing to support parking garage at our

16:51.200 --> 16:55.094
stadium facility and staff to support nondirect

16:55.142 --> 16:58.762
services paid for with Medicaid dollars such as

16:58.816 --> 17:02.538
billing. 46% of those

17:02.624 --> 17:06.714
are of those funds are

17:06.752 --> 17:10.790
non personnel items. 3% is in restricted accounts.

17:10.950 --> 17:14.878
The 72% is for non subrecipient contracts

17:14.894 --> 17:19.038
and basically that's used in environmental health to replace obsolete

17:19.214 --> 17:23.266
equipment in our RFID program and to

17:23.288 --> 17:26.260
operate our Digital Health Online food Managers class.

17:27.750 --> 17:31.230
Next slide, please. In laboratory services. This is pretty straightforward.

17:31.310 --> 17:34.382
The revenue from this Fund supports our lab operations

17:34.446 --> 17:38.370
and provides funding for laboratory equipment and laboratory

17:38.870 --> 17:41.820
and and laboratory services.

17:44.110 --> 17:47.974
A lot of our grants I'd like to mention actually support some of our laboratory

17:48.022 --> 17:51.562
services too, but this is the General Fund

17:51.616 --> 17:55.930
supportive Personnel and non personnel on swimming pools.

17:57.250 --> 18:00.282
69% of the Fund supports personnel.

18:00.346 --> 18:03.598
31% supports supplies and services,

18:03.764 --> 18:07.970
including mandatory education and training and testing supplies.

18:08.870 --> 18:12.242
The Fund 2010 Essential Public Health

18:12.296 --> 18:15.662
Services want to take a little bit more time to highlight

18:15.726 --> 18:20.646
what this Fund had actually done over the last few years? This 1115

18:20.748 --> 18:25.590
waiver supports both waiver programs

18:25.930 --> 18:28.886
and essential public health core services.

18:29.068 --> 18:33.510
In the past years, we have used these funds to support general operations,

18:33.670 --> 18:37.866
general Fund operations such as laboratory services, TB control,

18:38.048 --> 18:41.850
maintenance contracts and clinic supplies. This Fund

18:41.920 --> 18:45.306
has been a lifesaver for the Department operation and allowed

18:45.338 --> 18:49.040
us to be responsive in the emergencies. Over the last ten years,

18:49.570 --> 18:53.482
we have minimized the negative impact of General Fund reductions

18:53.546 --> 18:57.490
over the last few years by using these funds.

18:57.910 --> 19:01.838
We have an average of about 200 FTEs supported

19:01.934 --> 19:04.660
through this Fund. Over the past five years,

19:05.030 --> 19:08.254
we have funded programs, as I said earlier, like C to Succeed.

19:08.302 --> 19:11.410
Projecting savior smiles, my brother's keeper reentry

19:11.490 --> 19:14.406
supported lab services, our Don program,

19:14.508 --> 19:18.406
chronic disease, as well as our administrative services

19:18.508 --> 19:21.286
division. These funds are limited.

19:21.398 --> 19:25.670
So in the next year, what you will see is a restructuring plan to reduce

19:25.750 --> 19:28.460
both FTEs and operational support.

19:31.310 --> 19:34.878
Next slide please. Fund 24

19:34.964 --> 19:37.520
23 special waste our fog program.

19:38.610 --> 19:42.234
Basically, this Fund supports our fat, soil and grease

19:42.282 --> 19:46.210
inspections. It includes support for 48.3

19:46.280 --> 19:49.746
FTEs. The Fund is 84% personnel and

19:49.768 --> 19:53.458
supports those activities. 16% of the

19:53.464 --> 19:55.010
Fund support operations,

19:56.150 --> 19:59.838
36% is allocated to restricted accounts and

19:59.864 --> 20:03.830
64% is allocated to supply services and equipment.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.802
Next slide, please. 2023 budget

20:08.866 --> 20:14.060
Expenditure net Changes okay,

20:15.470 --> 20:20.074
of course, the first section covers the $61.1

20:20.112 --> 20:23.806
million, which is our current FY 21 22

20:23.828 --> 20:27.466
budget. Excuse me. Section two covers

20:27.498 --> 20:31.630
the operational operating budget adjustments.

20:32.530 --> 20:36.562
You see in that adjustments for our

20:36.616 --> 20:40.498
1115 waiver, our intergovernmental transfer

20:40.584 --> 20:43.966
funds, and also where we had received some council

20:44.158 --> 20:48.642
funds. The third section contractual

20:48.706 --> 20:52.514
mandated adjustments related to benefits, restricted accounts

20:52.562 --> 20:56.550
and our new a leaf facility. As I mentioned earlier.

20:56.970 --> 21:01.594
The fourth section is the proposed budget includes $2.2

21:01.632 --> 21:05.594
million transfer to the Special Health Revenue Fund for community health

21:05.632 --> 21:09.354
and environmental consumer health. Those are to fund those to

21:09.392 --> 21:12.700
transfer those eleven positions to that cost center.

21:13.390 --> 21:17.594
The current budget minus operating adjustments, plus mandated adjustments equal

21:17.642 --> 21:20.750
to a budget of $65.6 million,

21:20.820 --> 21:24.674
which is a 7.4% increase in our General Fund

21:24.712 --> 21:28.174
budget. The next slide gives our budget

21:28.222 --> 21:31.602
history. Probably need to explain it to you a little bit,

21:31.656 --> 21:35.294
because if you note in FY 19,

21:35.342 --> 21:38.822
the adopted budget does what didn't include jail health.

21:38.876 --> 21:42.406
But remember, we had to operate jail health for an additional year

21:42.508 --> 21:46.598
because the Joint Processing Center didn't open

21:46.764 --> 21:50.246
for another year. In FY 22, the estimate

21:50.278 --> 21:55.882
includes a 1.2 restricted account adjustment for the $750,000

21:55.936 --> 21:59.740
hope adjustments in FY 21.

22:02.210 --> 22:05.886
Just so that you will understand what we

22:05.908 --> 22:09.902
did there in that fiscal year, we redeployed General

22:09.956 --> 22:13.990
Fund staff to work COVID and so we built those expenses

22:14.170 --> 22:17.666
to those COVID grants which resulted in

22:17.848 --> 22:20.500
a reduced expenditures to the General Fund.

22:21.990 --> 22:25.700
And in FY 22 you will also see

22:26.790 --> 22:30.390
that resulted in the restricted accounts increase,

22:31.290 --> 22:34.726
which basically it is going to charge us more than what we have

22:34.748 --> 22:37.750
budgeted because we brought on more people and more computers.

22:38.330 --> 22:40.940
That pretty much explains that.

22:41.710 --> 22:45.446
That's the end of my financial budget presentation

22:45.638 --> 22:49.274
for FY 23. Thank you

22:49.312 --> 22:53.306
Director, for your presentation. A couple of questions. What are

22:53.328 --> 22:57.390
the areas of our city that have the low vaccination rates?

22:57.970 --> 23:01.760
I'm not going to guess. Why don't I send you the map that we have?

23:02.770 --> 23:06.334
During the height of COVID we actually did a weekly

23:06.382 --> 23:09.858
report showing areas that

23:10.024 --> 23:12.414
were concerned, there were target areas,

23:12.462 --> 23:16.770
just what we characterized as high COVID vulnerability

23:17.590 --> 23:21.426
areas based on an index that was produced by developed

23:21.458 --> 23:24.566
by CDC. Yeah, if you could send that to all of our offices, that would

23:24.588 --> 23:28.230
be great. We have some areas,

23:29.150 --> 23:32.506
I'm sure. Let's go to

23:32.528 --> 23:33.820
slide eight, please.

23:40.130 --> 23:44.160
So to get clarification on this slide again,

23:46.150 --> 23:50.082
with 40 million, you all are able to generate revenues of 25

23:50.136 --> 23:50.740
million.

23:53.270 --> 23:57.026
Yes. So if we were to allocate more dollars to

23:57.048 --> 24:01.030
you from the General Fund, would you be able to also generate more revenue?

24:02.890 --> 24:06.882
Probably not, because the areas that generate the revenue

24:06.946 --> 24:11.290
are primarily in our environmental health area where we're collecting fees

24:11.950 --> 24:15.290
for permits. If I had more General

24:15.360 --> 24:18.966
Fund dollars, of course I would spend them in programmatic areas.

24:19.158 --> 24:22.366
I think we need to focus more on chronic disease. I think

24:22.388 --> 24:27.546
we need to focus more on balance,

24:27.658 --> 24:31.374
youth balance. And I think that we need to

24:31.412 --> 24:34.160
also focus more on maternal child health issues.

24:35.350 --> 24:39.330
So comparison for the general fund dollars that we allocate

24:39.910 --> 24:43.970
estimated, how many dollars will you get in grants?

24:45.590 --> 24:48.598
I can tell you what we know that we're going to get. We're going to

24:48.604 --> 24:52.774
get about $65 million in the coming year

24:52.892 --> 24:55.670
in grants, and that's all over the map.

24:56.330 --> 25:00.198
We will have probably about $91 million in

25:00.284 --> 25:03.420
COVID dollars, but those dollars are going to end in about a year.

25:04.910 --> 25:08.566
So the $65 million you'll get in grants,

25:08.598 --> 25:11.594
is that including the COVID dollars or no? No.

25:11.632 --> 25:15.574
So outside of the COVID dollars, you're still going to get around estimated $65

25:15.632 --> 25:18.878
million in grants? Yes. And that's about

25:18.964 --> 25:22.222
what we usually get. Our budget for the last couple of years have been running

25:22.276 --> 25:25.826
about, what, $160,000,000,000 within that

25:25.848 --> 25:29.518
range for everything special funds, general funds,

25:29.534 --> 25:33.122
and grants. You want to use your microphone, Mr. Ashley, for everything,

25:33.256 --> 25:36.180
special funds, general funds, and grants by 165.

25:36.950 --> 25:41.054
Thank you. Next, we have questions by Council member

25:41.182 --> 25:44.086
Amy Peck. Thank you, Vice Chair. And thank you,

25:44.108 --> 25:48.006
Director, for the presentation. When you were talking about the 1115

25:48.108 --> 25:51.314
waiver restructuring and adjusting and moving personnel

25:51.362 --> 25:55.430
from that fund, can you just talk about that a little bit more for clarity?

25:55.510 --> 25:58.826
So you're moving personnel from the 1115 waiver that we were using to

25:58.848 --> 26:02.414
pay for their salaries to where's that money

26:02.452 --> 26:05.280
coming from now? Well,

26:09.910 --> 26:12.782
and I'm sure you've heard this from other department directors,

26:12.846 --> 26:17.106
but the general fund doesn't support some

26:17.128 --> 26:20.326
of the essential programs that I think our department should be

26:20.348 --> 26:23.014
running back. Starting in, I think,

26:23.052 --> 26:26.918
2011, 2012, we were able to access

26:27.004 --> 26:30.178
1115 Waiver funds. With those funds, we were

26:30.204 --> 26:33.900
able to bring on programs that I thought

26:34.990 --> 26:37.734
we needed to be running within the Health Department.

26:37.782 --> 26:42.074
For example, see, to succeed my

26:42.112 --> 26:45.854
Brother's Keeper program, our reentry program

26:45.972 --> 26:49.150
is funded by 1115 Waiver.

26:51.010 --> 26:55.120
So when those the 200 positions I mentioned,

26:55.810 --> 26:59.198
I can't just put them on the general fund. The general fund can't absorb

26:59.214 --> 27:03.662
them. So I will have to find other resources

27:03.726 --> 27:09.250
if we want to keep those services. If I'm not able to recoup

27:09.670 --> 27:13.654
enough revenue, we will have to actually reduce those

27:13.692 --> 27:17.026
services. Okay, so at this point, you're just looking for grants

27:17.058 --> 27:20.426
and other ways to pay for them. You're not moving anybody to the

27:20.448 --> 27:23.370
general fund that was on the 1115 waiver?

27:23.870 --> 27:27.100
My boss wouldn't let me do that. Okay.

27:28.190 --> 27:31.660
And then my last question is about environmental health.

27:32.750 --> 27:36.682
Something I've talked to Public Works about when it comes to inspections

27:36.826 --> 27:40.842
is working with other departments so that we're looking at if it's an apartment

27:40.906 --> 27:44.782
complex or a house that needs certain inspections, that we're working

27:44.836 --> 27:48.846
together and not working separately. So can you

27:48.868 --> 27:52.162
just talk a little bit about how well that has been from

27:52.216 --> 27:56.014
your perspective, working with Public Works to make sure that everything is being inspected

27:56.062 --> 27:59.574
kind of all at once? I think we have a very good working relationship

27:59.692 --> 28:03.522
with Public works, especially as it relates to the apartment complex,

28:03.586 --> 28:07.826
because sometimes a complaint will come into one department

28:07.938 --> 28:11.402
or the other. And our staff has been around long enough

28:11.456 --> 28:14.698
that they know what's our scope of responsibility and

28:14.704 --> 28:18.282
know to bring those other departments in. I think that

28:18.336 --> 28:22.442
the Waste Water Surveillance Initiative is a good example of

28:22.496 --> 28:25.822
how Public Works and our department are working well together.

28:25.956 --> 28:29.546
One thing that it's in the works. I haven't

28:29.578 --> 28:33.680
really told staff about this, but they'll know now. Council Member Kayman is

28:35.250 --> 28:38.578
carol and I were out at an event related to lead

28:38.664 --> 28:42.802
and we thought that we could actually broaden those activities because

28:42.856 --> 28:46.306
of just the age of the houses. And in the last week or

28:46.328 --> 28:50.086
so, we're passing emails back and forth talking about how we

28:50.108 --> 28:51.480
were going to approach this.

28:55.690 --> 28:57.750
Council Member Sally Alcorn.

28:58.810 --> 29:02.026
Thank you, Vice Chair. And thank you, Director, for all the great work you've done

29:02.048 --> 29:05.722
during COVID on slide four. Thank you for that. The red and green

29:05.776 --> 29:08.934
one. You were talking about administrative funds,

29:08.982 --> 29:10.700
and I wanted to be clear.

29:12.530 --> 29:16.240
Those grant funds do come with administrative funds built in.

29:17.170 --> 29:21.018
You're not supporting all of those with general fund admin?

29:21.114 --> 29:24.586
No. Yeah, we couldn't support and they have varying

29:24.618 --> 29:28.290
percentages, I'm sure, of administrative funds associated with those.

29:28.440 --> 29:32.062
They do. Okay, great. Houston permitting

29:32.126 --> 29:35.742
and I rarely get any complaints about the Health Department.

29:35.806 --> 29:39.294
Houston part of Houston Permitting. How many employees

29:39.342 --> 29:42.438
do you I mean, I know swimming pool safety and then what else do you

29:42.444 --> 29:46.406
do? Like at HPC? Do you know how many FTEs are over there

29:46.508 --> 29:49.350
in the permitting system from hell? No, I don't. But Patrick,

29:51.550 --> 29:55.642
four total. Okay. And on

29:55.696 --> 29:59.466
temporary employees, you mentioned that as we are seeing decreases in

29:59.488 --> 30:03.494
COVID and the grants funding, I mean, do you anticipate

30:03.542 --> 30:07.342
that some of the temporary employees or some of the people we've taken on will

30:07.476 --> 30:10.986
not no longer be I mean, how long do you anticipate

30:11.018 --> 30:13.706
most of the COVID related temporary employees?

30:13.898 --> 30:17.066
Well, an interesting thing has happened during COVID especially during this

30:17.108 --> 30:20.782
point in our other programs,

30:20.846 --> 30:24.414
whether they're grant funded in some general fund positions. We have a lot of vacancies

30:24.462 --> 30:28.322
on that side. So those individuals that have been working no good.

30:28.376 --> 30:32.006
Yeah. We are looking to figure out

30:32.028 --> 30:35.382
whether or not there is a fit. We don't want

30:35.436 --> 30:38.918
to run the risk of letting everybody go and then we go

30:39.084 --> 30:43.094
into another surgeon. So we're engaging in some cross training.

30:43.292 --> 30:47.018
Sure. Okay. And finally, I was going to ask the

30:47.024 --> 30:50.746
kinder and Hobby School study that talked about a tale of

30:50.768 --> 30:54.986
two departments that came out in December. Did recommend some areas

30:55.098 --> 30:58.574
where we could possibly do an MoU with the county. Not talking about

30:58.612 --> 31:02.138
merging departments or anything. Don't beat

31:02.154 --> 31:04.810
me up between us.

31:04.980 --> 31:08.226
Okay. But if you could opine a bit.

31:08.408 --> 31:12.706
They list several areas of overlap and disease control and

31:12.808 --> 31:16.206
prevention, dental services, environmental, public health, women and Children's

31:16.238 --> 31:19.566
health, Nutrition and Chronic Disease Program, public Health Awareness

31:19.678 --> 31:23.150
Policy and Planning and Finance Administration. I mean,

31:23.240 --> 31:26.886
could we start small with some MoUs? And you've done a good job, like with

31:26.988 --> 31:30.614
air quality monitoring and stuff like that with the county, but where could we do

31:30.652 --> 31:33.914
an additional MoU to possibly gain Efficiencies one

31:33.952 --> 31:37.514
day? Okay, I'm going to make a general comment because they made

31:37.552 --> 31:41.046
a comment publicly that somebody told me about. I wasn't

31:41.078 --> 31:45.310
very pleased with the report because I do not think that they accurately

31:46.050 --> 31:50.170
represented the differences between the department.

31:50.330 --> 31:54.218
I will give you an example. When they looked at our immunization

31:54.314 --> 31:58.098
program, they compared our putting shots in

31:58.104 --> 32:02.354
arms and the county's putting shots in arm. That is a

32:02.392 --> 32:05.060
minor part of our immunization program.

32:05.430 --> 32:09.474
We have relationships with all of the providers within

32:09.592 --> 32:13.494
Houston and Harris County. We're a state contractor that

32:13.532 --> 32:16.902
have to monitor our Vaccines for Children program and

32:16.956 --> 32:20.466
all of that. None of that stuff was included, and so I think they fell

32:20.498 --> 32:23.946
short of that. But to the core of your question, there are

32:23.968 --> 32:27.882
a lot of things that we are doing with the county. We mentioned our

32:27.936 --> 32:31.274
One Safe, Houston. The credible messenger stuff.

32:31.312 --> 32:34.766
We have been working with them. There are some things that we already

32:34.868 --> 32:38.394
have in place that they just missed.

32:38.522 --> 32:42.142
We were in the middle of COVID My staff did send me

32:42.196 --> 32:46.100
responses, but they weren't that complimentary, so I didn't send them.

32:47.750 --> 32:51.266
But we are in the process of working with the county, and what

32:51.288 --> 32:55.540
we're going to do is come up with an MoU that really

32:56.470 --> 32:59.878
will formalize the relationships that we have.

33:00.044 --> 33:04.966
What I'm looking at is actually modeling it after an

33:04.988 --> 33:08.182
interlocal agreement that I'm familiar with between the

33:08.236 --> 33:11.346
City of Austin and Travis County. And I lived

33:11.378 --> 33:14.666
that life for years, and so I know how

33:14.688 --> 33:18.058
that can be modeled. Thank you. I'd appreciate just being kept in the loop on

33:18.064 --> 33:21.446
that. I'll do it. Thank you. Council member Abby

33:21.478 --> 33:24.400
Cayman. Hi, Director. Hi.

33:25.010 --> 33:29.054
First off, I really want to recognize the department under

33:29.092 --> 33:32.234
your leadership for everything during COVID

33:32.362 --> 33:35.454
We quickly talk about COVID and talk about shots and arms,

33:35.502 --> 33:38.546
but the extent to which you and

33:38.568 --> 33:42.386
the entire department have had to deal with not

33:42.408 --> 33:45.870
only an unprecedented global pandemic, but the primary

33:45.950 --> 33:49.654
purpose, you all were at the tip of the spear in terms

33:49.692 --> 33:53.400
of the response to that. So thank you to everyone

33:54.010 --> 33:57.686
for everything that you did and continue to do because

33:57.868 --> 34:01.574
it's still ongoing. But on top of all of that, all the programs you

34:01.612 --> 34:05.098
continue to run. Working with my office on the lead survey that

34:05.104 --> 34:08.330
we did in Friedman's town, even just

34:08.400 --> 34:11.738
on the phone right now trying to work through some of the formula shortage issues.

34:11.904 --> 34:15.774
You all continue to be that

34:15.812 --> 34:19.374
first line of response and caring for Houstonians every single day

34:19.412 --> 34:21.680
to that point. I don't know if you mentioned it.

34:22.530 --> 34:26.530
How many Houstonians does the health department serve?

34:28.470 --> 34:31.986
Well, there are different answers to that

34:32.008 --> 34:34.420
question because it depends on the program.

34:34.790 --> 34:38.626
For the most part, our department covers all of Houston,

34:38.818 --> 34:42.230
so the total population of Houston. But for certain

34:42.300 --> 34:45.858
programs, we cover all of Harris County. The Immunization

34:45.954 --> 34:49.286
program that I mentioned earlier, one would think that our

34:49.308 --> 34:52.618
responsibility is only the city of Houston, but it's not.

34:52.704 --> 34:55.900
It's all of Harris County. We are

34:56.430 --> 34:59.926
the state's point for Immunizations within all of Harris

34:59.958 --> 35:03.754
County for our laboratory services. And I mentioned this.

35:03.872 --> 35:06.894
We actually have a 17 county catchment area.

35:07.012 --> 35:10.462
So it really depends on the program.

35:10.596 --> 35:14.362
But our core is Houston, our Seed to succeed program, because we partially

35:14.426 --> 35:18.254
fund it through grants. We service all of the school districts

35:18.302 --> 35:21.730
within the region, not just HISD.

35:23.110 --> 35:26.766
I appreciate that answer in the context I'm going to switch

35:26.798 --> 35:30.600
gears really quickly. I'm going to ask an unpleasant question.

35:31.690 --> 35:34.994
Looking at page nine. The Swimming Pool

35:35.042 --> 35:36.120
Safety Fund.

35:39.450 --> 35:43.238
I'm not as familiar with that program. And given

35:43.324 --> 35:46.906
the fact that I don't want to be asking this question, I don't want us

35:46.928 --> 35:50.154
to be in the position where we aren't going to have pools open this

35:50.192 --> 35:53.742
summer. What we've heard from the Parks Department is because we don't have enough

35:53.796 --> 35:58.190
lifeguards, we're going to have to reduce the number of pools open. Does that impact

35:59.010 --> 36:02.302
the Pool Safety Fund in terms of operation or what's needed

36:02.356 --> 36:04.640
there? We will.

36:06.070 --> 36:09.826
Patrick Key is our assistant director, and shortly after he

36:09.848 --> 36:13.566
came in, naomi Macias, who is newly

36:13.598 --> 36:17.118
appointed assistant Director, was actually over consumer

36:17.134 --> 36:20.946
in that. But several years ago, we developed

36:20.978 --> 36:25.238
a strategy where we cross train people to make sure that

36:25.404 --> 36:29.154
when swimming pool season arrived,

36:29.202 --> 36:33.374
we were able to redeploy staff to actually ensure

36:33.522 --> 36:37.146
that pools were inspected. It's one of the programs where I

36:37.168 --> 36:40.506
get calls from my neighbor if my community pool is

36:40.528 --> 36:44.454
not open or there's a problem with it. So it's like that. So the resources

36:44.502 --> 36:47.950
that are allocated here are still being utilized even though the public

36:48.020 --> 36:50.890
pools may be limited. In operations,

36:51.050 --> 36:54.334
we inspect parks pools. Actually, that was one of the first things

36:54.372 --> 36:57.886
I did when I came here. Joe and his folks were inspecting

36:57.918 --> 37:01.426
their own pools, and we had an agreement that

37:01.448 --> 37:05.134
it would probably be best if the Health Department, which inspected

37:05.182 --> 37:08.186
all other public pools, inspected parks pools.

37:08.238 --> 37:11.878
Also. I'll follow up on

37:11.884 --> 37:14.726
the question. I know my time is I'll put you back in the car.

37:14.748 --> 37:17.750
Thank you, council Member Jackson. Thank you.

37:17.900 --> 37:21.814
And thank you, Director Williams, for just all your work and

37:21.852 --> 37:25.930
just the partnership. I know my office worked closely with you. We were able to

37:26.080 --> 37:29.786
get in the incredible messenger program rolled out and other initiatives. So just

37:29.808 --> 37:33.854
thank you and your staff for just your commitment. As I'm looking at

37:33.892 --> 37:37.886
the major services and I see all the services

37:37.988 --> 37:41.214
that your major services under Human Services,

37:41.412 --> 37:45.002
the highlighted ones, is just disturbing to see that. There's no

37:45.076 --> 37:48.814
dollars allocated for General fund dollars allocated

37:48.862 --> 37:52.414
for these services, like Aging and Disabilities and Reentry

37:52.462 --> 37:56.114
program. This is Human Services. And so my

37:56.152 --> 37:59.766
question to you is, how many grant writers do you have? Because it seemed like

37:59.788 --> 38:03.240
you're spending all your time writing grants to serve the people.

38:04.650 --> 38:09.222
Usually in health departments, the folks that direct

38:09.276 --> 38:12.806
the programs write the grants. We don't have special grant writers,

38:12.838 --> 38:16.874
except sometimes our planners or

38:17.072 --> 38:20.666
analysts will write grants. But you will find people all

38:20.688 --> 38:23.550
over our department writing grants.

38:24.210 --> 38:27.886
Okay. I know recently with the One

38:27.908 --> 38:31.214
Safe Houston, there was anywhere from

38:31.252 --> 38:34.062
I know there was a lot of money from the ARPA dollars.

38:34.196 --> 38:37.666
So does the budget include those dollars, or is

38:37.688 --> 38:40.820
it we did not include opera dollars.

38:42.390 --> 38:46.674
We did not include the opera dollars in this report because

38:46.872 --> 38:50.758
we were still going through the process. Okay, all right.

38:50.844 --> 38:53.510
It would only add $2 million to the budget.

38:54.650 --> 38:58.166
Okay, well, we need those. I'm talking about from my department. Oh,

38:58.188 --> 39:02.022
really? Yes. I know how to know that. Maybe three,

39:02.076 --> 39:06.490
but I'm at you only 1 million for reentry,

39:06.830 --> 39:12.054
and then I think a half million for Credible

39:12.102 --> 39:17.006
Messenger, and then maybe another million for

39:17.108 --> 39:18.430
street interventions.

39:20.450 --> 39:24.250
Okay, thank you, sir. All right, Council Member

39:24.330 --> 39:25.070
Cayman,

39:28.150 --> 39:31.522
I'll submit a question to you all related to the pool fund,

39:31.576 --> 39:34.574
so I can understand a little bit more. But lastly,

39:34.622 --> 39:38.082
Director, you've already flagged some of the needs.

39:38.136 --> 39:41.874
And what I'm asking every department is, as we look ahead, we have the financial

39:41.922 --> 39:45.880
constraints imposed by the city based on revenue caps and other things.

39:46.410 --> 39:50.366
But looking ahead, what do we need to be aware of on the horizon

39:50.418 --> 39:53.946
for the needs of the Health Department? I think

39:53.968 --> 39:57.980
I mentioned the areas that I think need most support.

40:00.270 --> 40:04.254
Chronic disease is something that I think we need a further investment in

40:04.452 --> 40:07.706
maternal and child health issues and certainly youth

40:07.738 --> 40:11.054
balance issues. But the

40:11.092 --> 40:14.686
thing that also that we

40:14.708 --> 40:18.434
need to look at are some of those wraparound services that

40:18.472 --> 40:22.194
we need to provide to clients in order to be successful regardless of

40:22.232 --> 40:26.180
the core program that they're accessing. For example,

40:26.550 --> 40:29.954
for years, even in our program as Chorus

40:30.002 --> 40:33.894
TV, our staff had to

40:33.932 --> 40:37.074
find sources for food, sometimes housing,

40:37.202 --> 40:41.194
to ensure that the clients were readily accessible so

40:41.232 --> 40:45.142
that they could take their TV medicine. And that's for the overall

40:45.206 --> 40:47.900
protection of the community.

40:48.750 --> 40:52.566
I don't want to just say, yes, we need more General Fund

40:52.608 --> 40:56.334
money, and leave you with the impression that we're not

40:56.532 --> 40:59.600
aggressively looking for

41:00.210 --> 41:04.202
increased revenue. We've been very active statewide

41:04.346 --> 41:07.650
looking at the transition from the 1115 waiver.

41:07.990 --> 41:10.994
There is uncompensated care fund.

41:11.032 --> 41:14.926
We're trying to maximize our ability to draw down funds

41:14.958 --> 41:17.714
on, and of course,

41:17.752 --> 41:19.890
we continue to seek grants.

41:26.030 --> 41:29.418
Director, I want to thank you again for your presentation. To you and your entire

41:29.504 --> 41:33.754
team, we thank you all for all that you do. We have immense

41:33.882 --> 41:37.854
appreciation for the work that continues, especially during the

41:37.892 --> 41:41.534
pandemic. That was a time of real

41:41.572 --> 41:45.280
uncertainty, in a time that we were continuously moving,

41:45.750 --> 41:49.266
continuously trying to react, and from setting up

41:49.288 --> 41:52.820
the testing sites to setting up the

41:53.670 --> 41:57.458
vaccine sites, all the logistics that went on with that

41:57.624 --> 42:00.886
through your leadership and your entire staff and team, we want to say thank

42:00.908 --> 42:04.470
you for all that you do. Thank you. And you were dismissed.

42:13.150 --> 42:16.890
We have four virtual speakers

42:17.710 --> 42:21.862
and two in person speakers. We will start with the virtual

42:21.926 --> 42:26.110
speakers. The first is melissa Martinez,

42:26.450 --> 42:28.240
please press star six.

42:34.570 --> 42:37.640
Melissa Martinez, please press star six.

42:41.710 --> 42:45.630
Geo Grocer, please press star six to unmute.

42:49.930 --> 42:56.402
Geogroph star

42:56.456 --> 42:57.810
six to unmute.

43:00.630 --> 43:08.678
Jason Oliver hello,

43:08.764 --> 43:12.250
and thank you for the health presentation.

43:13.310 --> 43:17.162
It's really concerning to kind of hear health come back year

43:17.216 --> 43:20.394
after year, saying that they really could do

43:20.432 --> 43:24.102
quite a bit in terms of, say, chronic disease, youth violence,

43:24.166 --> 43:27.262
and maternal and child health with more general

43:27.316 --> 43:31.162
fund dollars. I'm interested because you talked about that's, what you would prioritize

43:31.306 --> 43:35.006
in terms of programming. Have you priced out any programs for

43:35.028 --> 43:37.930
these areas that could be implemented during fiscal year 2023?

43:37.940 --> 43:41.220
And then second,

43:41.750 --> 43:45.234
because youth violence, of course, seems like an issue that we should really care about

43:45.272 --> 43:48.466
right now. Second, behavioral health interventions announced and

43:48.488 --> 43:52.326
approved during last year's budget don't appear to have been implemented yet,

43:52.348 --> 43:56.354
and it sounds like those aren't housed there. But are those initiatives

43:56.402 --> 44:01.154
housed within the Health Department? And then why is implementation seemingly

44:01.202 --> 44:04.506
delayed? I'm going to start

44:04.528 --> 44:08.186
with your first question. Many times the priorities of

44:08.208 --> 44:11.946
the department is going to be led by the director of that department. So they

44:11.968 --> 44:15.630
are the ones to identify certain programs

44:16.370 --> 44:19.774
that they believe are beneficial, and they will put those in as

44:19.812 --> 44:23.390
line items for us to consider and put forth.

44:24.530 --> 44:28.178
Of course, there can always be additional programs and additional dollars that

44:28.264 --> 44:31.614
would be needed for advancing those programs,

44:31.662 --> 44:35.730
but that discretion remains with the director.

44:36.390 --> 44:40.214
And your second question was my

44:40.252 --> 44:43.814
second question was about the behavioral health interventions that were

44:43.852 --> 44:47.574
announced last year, right. All of the MCOT teams that

44:47.612 --> 44:54.186
were especially important as alternative responders are

44:54.208 --> 44:57.686
those housed within the Health Department. And then what's

44:57.718 --> 45:02.042
going on with the delay in implementation? Why is implementation taking

45:02.096 --> 45:05.498
a while? We're going

45:05.504 --> 45:08.526
to have to get back to you on that particular question to make sure that

45:08.548 --> 45:12.014
we give you the specifics. So if you want to please send

45:12.052 --> 45:16.070
us that question via email to District E at houst

45:16.250 --> 45:19.410
gov. We'll get back to you shortly.

45:21.430 --> 45:23.780
Okay, thank you. You're welcome.

45:27.730 --> 45:29.230
Amanda Psy.

45:30.470 --> 45:33.550
Hi. Thank you. I'm a resident

45:33.630 --> 45:37.538
of District I, and I just wanted to

45:37.624 --> 45:41.154
echo my kind of sadness to

45:41.192 --> 45:45.346
hear that it sounds like support for programs

45:45.378 --> 45:48.962
that the speaker really cared about. See, to succeed,

45:49.026 --> 45:54.822
reentry my Brother's Keeper, things like that are

45:54.876 --> 45:57.962
losing money. Can you share a little bit more

45:58.016 --> 46:01.946
about the 1115 wafer and

46:01.968 --> 46:05.082
then yeah. Is there anything that could be done

46:05.136 --> 46:08.830
to help continue the support of these programs?

46:11.330 --> 46:14.958
So the support of the programs not only come from, of course, the general

46:15.044 --> 46:19.246
fund, but throughout the year, the directors do look to get

46:19.428 --> 46:22.946
grant dollars that fund many of the programs that you were

46:22.968 --> 46:26.946
speaking about. As council members, we also have council district service funds where

46:26.968 --> 46:30.882
we work directly with the department to understand their

46:30.936 --> 46:34.850
needs and identify ways in which we can support

46:35.000 --> 46:38.166
specific programs that are unique to our community. So when it comes

46:38.188 --> 46:42.002
to reentry or first responders, I know my office has allocated

46:42.066 --> 46:46.042
dollars towards the My Brothers Keeper program, and so that's ways

46:46.096 --> 46:49.722
in which we can assist and also supplement the department with

46:49.776 --> 46:51.210
specific programming.

46:57.660 --> 47:01.196
Next is okay, did you have

47:01.218 --> 47:04.588
a thank you? Okay, you will? Yes.

47:04.754 --> 47:09.612
I also just wanted to ask

47:09.666 --> 47:13.920
about support for domestic violence

47:15.060 --> 47:18.812
programs. Are there any initiatives

47:18.876 --> 47:21.970
that would fall under Houston Health for that?

47:25.540 --> 47:29.508
I believe there are, but let us make sure that we get you a specific

47:29.594 --> 47:32.896
answer on that. I know that they work in collaboration with the Houston Police

47:32.928 --> 47:36.004
Department, and many of us have an

47:36.042 --> 47:40.116
interest in ensuring that we have dollars of programming towards domestic

47:40.148 --> 47:43.364
violence. So please submit that answer directly to District

47:43.412 --> 47:47.060
E at Houst Gov and we will respond

47:47.140 --> 47:47.960
promptly.

47:50.760 --> 47:52.820
Next is Saba Blanding.

47:57.070 --> 48:00.726
Hi, I wanted to follow up on that about domestic violence.

48:00.758 --> 48:03.866
Yesterday, Council Member Martin asked the chief of Police what

48:03.888 --> 48:07.158
we should do about domestic violence. Then a speaker shared

48:07.174 --> 48:10.926
that they were a survivor of domestic violence. I did not hear anyone take the

48:10.948 --> 48:14.714
opportunity to ask them what would have helped them. Domestic violence

48:14.762 --> 48:18.130
is a health issue, and my question is, what efforts is the city making

48:18.200 --> 48:21.666
to engage survivors in organizations such

48:21.688 --> 48:25.214
as Houston Area Women's Center to address interrupting

48:25.262 --> 48:28.290
domestic violence, not just once it's happened? And then,

48:28.360 --> 48:31.846
what is being done to specifically help support the health and

48:31.868 --> 48:35.266
well being of Houstonians in possession of female reproductive organs?

48:35.378 --> 48:38.742
According to the 2020 Report,

48:38.796 --> 48:42.662
texas has 35 maternal deaths in 100,000.

48:42.796 --> 48:46.674
To give some perspective, the national maternal mortality

48:46.722 --> 48:50.650
rate for 2020 was 23.8 deaths per 100,000

48:50.720 --> 48:53.166
live births, compared with a rate of 20.1 in 2019.

48:53.168 --> 48:57.034
And of course, there are current and upcoming restrictions to accessing

48:57.082 --> 49:00.446
abortion health care. Great questions as

49:00.468 --> 49:04.554
it pertains to domestic violence, I know within the mayor's new One Safe

49:04.602 --> 49:08.690
Houston plan, I believe he directed a million

49:08.760 --> 49:12.834
dollars towards the Houston Area Women's Center, and those

49:12.872 --> 49:16.626
are additional dollars that came through the Cares Act,

49:16.728 --> 49:20.126
no matter of fact, ARPA dollars. And so that's

49:20.158 --> 49:23.942
one way in which we as a council are trying to assist with

49:24.076 --> 49:27.186
providing more resources on domestic violence.

49:27.218 --> 49:30.120
But I believe council Member Cayman, did you want to chime in?

49:31.530 --> 49:34.998
PABA, thank you for the question. And this is just a few examples, and we'd

49:35.014 --> 49:38.906
be happy to follow up. I think the city is trying to leverage all

49:39.008 --> 49:42.518
community partners, not just City of Houston, including the Harris

49:42.534 --> 49:46.094
County Domestic Violence Coordinating Council going

49:46.132 --> 49:49.150
back to COVID, and I can speak from COVID on right,

49:49.220 --> 49:52.862
the no

49:52.916 --> 49:56.794
COVID abuse program. So what we found is with domestic

49:56.842 --> 50:00.226
abuse, a lot of survivors were trapped at

50:00.248 --> 50:03.620
home with their families. Motion to extend. Sure.

50:04.950 --> 50:08.926
So the city launched and brought together community partners

50:09.118 --> 50:12.422
to launch that, working with Hawk to do online

50:12.556 --> 50:16.246
reporting, texting services, anything to get the word out

50:16.268 --> 50:19.874
and also educate and help. But in addition to that, the mayor added

50:19.922 --> 50:23.990
in into the Office of Human Trafficking,

50:24.150 --> 50:27.766
a specific charge now also to include domestic

50:27.798 --> 50:34.282
violence in that. So that is now in the mayor's office as a permanent office.

50:34.416 --> 50:37.834
In addition to that, throughout COVID, the additional housing

50:37.882 --> 50:41.840
funding that we provided. Right. So you have the issues with

50:43.730 --> 50:47.370
housing during the pandemic, you can't keep everyone in a shelter and

50:47.460 --> 50:51.054
there was an increased need. So city funding,

50:51.102 --> 50:53.410
council funding, hotels,

50:53.750 --> 50:57.534
additional services, job training that was actually launched,

50:57.582 --> 51:00.638
partnerships to actually train people. Because one of the things that happens with

51:00.664 --> 51:04.422
domestic violence, you end up in a cycle because you are

51:04.476 --> 51:08.326
dependent on that abuser financially. So the

51:08.348 --> 51:12.038
city is actually starting to focus on job training programs. And we

51:12.044 --> 51:15.658
can get you more information on that. There's a

51:15.664 --> 51:19.062
whole list of things, but that's just a few examples,

51:19.206 --> 51:22.662
not just the immediate response, immediate funding to Dart

51:22.726 --> 51:26.270
HPD, but the holistic

51:26.930 --> 51:30.720
approach that the city is trying to take in addressing the issue.

51:31.410 --> 51:35.066
Are you also studying this within your Women's commission?

51:35.258 --> 51:38.814
Is this one of the action items that

51:38.852 --> 51:42.414
you all are looking at? I can't speak for the Women's

51:42.462 --> 51:46.174
Commission because, again, that's an independent commission under the charge of the mayor.

51:46.222 --> 51:49.074
But I do believe they are looking at that issue as well.

51:49.112 --> 51:53.058
It's remaining at the forefront in a multitude

51:53.074 --> 51:56.978
of ways. And then the city is supporting Houston Area Women's

51:56.994 --> 52:00.902
Center in their expansion of their new campus. That's going to be

52:00.956 --> 52:04.294
in District D, but there's

52:04.342 --> 52:07.820
a lot of extraordinary work happening in that space.

52:08.750 --> 52:10.940
Great, thank you. Thank you for your questions,

52:12.910 --> 52:14.810
Mr. Broderick butler.

52:20.750 --> 52:24.526
My name is Broderick Butler. I'm from northeast Houston. I respect the

52:24.548 --> 52:28.110
health director's detailed responses to numerous members

52:28.180 --> 52:31.586
of council. It would have been nice if he could have done the same for

52:31.608 --> 52:35.122
the four public speakers. But if I were

52:35.176 --> 52:38.786
here to ask him, I'd like to know from that list that he gave us

52:38.808 --> 52:42.274
with all the red lettering, what his priorities would be.

52:42.392 --> 52:45.574
So if you want to put yourself in his shoes and tell me what his

52:45.612 --> 52:49.414
priorities would be for funding for the unfunded projects that he

52:49.452 --> 52:52.950
has, I would love to hear that. Lastly, I'd like to make a statement.

52:53.290 --> 52:56.966
I would like to acknowledge my council member, Tossa Jackson,

52:57.158 --> 53:00.330
today. She stood 10ft tall for me because

53:00.400 --> 53:03.706
she embodied the saying that the only thing necessary for

53:03.728 --> 53:07.406
the triumph of evil is for good men and women

53:07.588 --> 53:11.840
to do nothing. Thank you. Thank you.

53:13.250 --> 53:16.350
No answer. I didn't hear a question

53:16.420 --> 53:19.726
in any of that. I said to give me the priorities from the list of

53:19.748 --> 53:22.546
the unfunded things the health director show. No,

53:22.648 --> 53:25.742
you said to put ourselves in the shoes of the director.

53:25.806 --> 53:29.346
You guys are answering the questions. If you would like

53:29.368 --> 53:32.998
to ask us directly. We asked detailed questions of each of you,

53:33.164 --> 53:37.080
gave detailed answers to each of you to the questions you gave.

53:37.770 --> 53:41.160
We didn't have that opportunity. So since he is not here,

53:44.170 --> 53:47.942
we can't talk over each other. So if you could give me these answers

53:48.086 --> 53:51.354
for the list of the top priorities he would have

53:51.392 --> 53:55.002
to choose from off that list of unfunded things,

53:55.136 --> 53:58.510
I would appreciate it. If you can't, you can't. If you can, you can.

53:58.660 --> 54:02.030
Directors report to the mayor. We as council members,

54:02.100 --> 54:05.486
report to the public. So if you have a question for us,

54:05.668 --> 54:09.182
then you can give that to us. Now. We can take your question and

54:09.316 --> 54:12.818
submit that over to the director to provide an answer to you

54:12.904 --> 54:16.350
from his standpoint, but we're not going to step in his shoes.

54:16.430 --> 54:20.642
And the reason in which you all are speaking to us as a council is

54:20.696 --> 54:24.678
because we report to you. The directors report to

54:24.844 --> 54:28.438
the mayor in his administration, and so they were asked to

54:28.444 --> 54:31.942
leave, and that's why their questions are being reported to us from the public.

54:32.076 --> 54:35.798
Okay? So if you have a direct question to us, we can answer. If not,

54:35.884 --> 54:39.018
if the question is for the director, we will submit for you,

54:39.104 --> 54:42.154
and then we will provide their response. I'm not here to talk to you.

54:42.192 --> 54:45.806
I'm here to talk to the director. So therefore, there's a flaw in

54:45.828 --> 54:49.118
that logic of who I provide the question

54:49.204 --> 54:53.680
to. He answered detailed questions from you,

54:54.050 --> 54:57.898
and he couldn't do the same for us because he was dismissed.

54:57.994 --> 55:01.266
So therefore, that is a flaw in this

55:01.288 --> 55:04.594
whole process. And I didn't want to go here, but since

55:04.632 --> 55:08.466
we are, that's a flaw in this process. Each of these individuals that

55:08.488 --> 55:12.354
have stood before us are compensated very well. And the

55:12.392 --> 55:15.746
question previously that I wanted to say that the airport

55:15.778 --> 55:19.814
director said he gave a sterling list of people

55:19.852 --> 55:22.662
that he lost. But you know what I would have said to him?

55:22.796 --> 55:26.646
Competency gets compensation. And you're supposed

55:26.748 --> 55:30.054
to build up people that leave you and

55:30.092 --> 55:33.654
go to different departments in different countries and different sections and

55:33.692 --> 55:37.006
exemplary and show that I was produced by

55:37.028 --> 55:40.526
the Houston airport system. So that's what I would have said to

55:40.548 --> 55:43.822
him. It's sad, but next

55:43.876 --> 55:46.480
man up. Thank you, sir.

55:50.130 --> 55:54.190
We have no more public speakers. And that concludes our health

55:54.340 --> 55:56.170
department presentation.
