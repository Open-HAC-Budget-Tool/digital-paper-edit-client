WEBVTT

00:04.810 --> 00:08.922
It is twelve 01:00 p.m. On Wednesday,

00:09.066 --> 00:10.590
May 11,

00:12.530 --> 00:15.662
I call this meeting to order and would like to welcome all council members

00:15.716 --> 00:20.154
in attendance. Council Member Amy Peck, council Member Tasha

00:20.202 --> 00:23.630
Jackson, council Member Mary NAN Huffman,

00:23.970 --> 00:27.266

00:27.298 --> 00:30.834
Pro TEM Martha Castex Tatum, council Member Leticia

00:30.882 --> 00:33.990
Plummer and Council Member Sally Alcorn,

00:34.490 --> 00:38.550
and staff from Council Member Carlos Cisnero's office.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.578
And we missing Tiffany D.

00:41.664 --> 00:44.854
Thomas. Council member Tiffany D Thomas.

00:44.902 --> 00:48.586
Never miss you ever else. We'll hear

00:48.608 --> 00:50.220
about it for the rest of our lives.

00:52.770 --> 00:55.914
Before we start, vice Chair Ed Pollard. As we begin this journey,

00:55.962 --> 00:59.870
this is the first of I think we have 25 meetings,

01:00.530 --> 01:05.810
23 individual departments, and then this

01:05.880 --> 01:09.902
analysis that we'll see this morning on the five year forecast. Any comments?

01:10.046 --> 01:14.274
No comments at this time. Immediately following the

01:14.392 --> 01:18.482
specially called BFA to go over the 2023 budget

01:18.546 --> 01:22.374
workshop, it will begin with the Finance Department presenting at

01:22.412 --> 01:26.262
01:00 today in the Houston Fire Department presenting at 130.

01:26.396 --> 01:30.614
Additionally, the budget workshop schedule is posted on the BFA

01:30.662 --> 01:34.118
website. All budget workshops will be in person except

01:34.134 --> 01:37.754
for public speakers which have the option to comment in person or

01:37.792 --> 01:41.306
virtually. Are there any members of the public who are

01:41.328 --> 01:44.398
here in person and would like to participate? There is a sign up sheet in

01:44.404 --> 01:48.426
the front table. My staff member Carolina will be monitoring

01:48.458 --> 01:52.074
the public speakers list. As a reminder, the only people attending

01:52.122 --> 01:55.682
public or public speak virtually are public speakers. There are

01:55.736 --> 01:59.486
five virtual public speakers signed up for the public comment

01:59.598 --> 02:03.042
for this particular meeting. We will get their questions after

02:03.096 --> 02:06.918
the presentations and after questions from council members have

02:07.004 --> 02:10.866
concluded. At this time, I'd like to welcome Director Tantry Emo

02:10.898 --> 02:14.818
to provide the fiscal year 2023 budget overview

02:14.994 --> 02:18.342
and General Fund five year forecast.

02:18.486 --> 02:22.310
Also like to welcome Council Member David Robinson to the podium

02:22.390 --> 02:25.894
to the Horseshoe, and Deputy Finance

02:25.942 --> 02:28.598
Chair Will The Thrill Jones.

02:28.694 --> 02:32.750
Looking good, Will. And Council member Abby Cayman.

02:35.330 --> 02:36.400
Thank you.

03:03.140 --> 03:06.560
Thank. Good afternoon, mayor protem and council member.

03:07.060 --> 03:11.024
I don't know if you have the slides on. I am

03:11.062 --> 03:14.560
here joined by William, deputy Director William Jones.

03:14.900 --> 03:19.376
He is over the financial Planning and Analysis divisions presenting

03:19.408 --> 03:22.964
the fiscal year 2023 budget overview and General Fund five

03:23.002 --> 03:26.372
year forecast. First, I do want to recognize Mr.

03:26.426 --> 03:29.830
Jones and his limited team members. Hopefully they are all here

03:30.440 --> 03:34.164
who are here today as well as Citywide Department's financial

03:34.212 --> 03:37.816
team for pushing hard to prepare this budget on time. In front of

03:37.838 --> 03:41.704
us. Again, thank you. We do have very limited resources

03:41.752 --> 03:45.132
and I am so proud and pleased so that we can actually

03:45.186 --> 03:48.732
get this budget done timely with that. Let's go

03:48.786 --> 03:49.900
to the slides.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.044
Thank you. So again,

03:56.242 --> 03:59.696
in here we will go over the budget overview and the budget revenues and

03:59.718 --> 04:03.440
expenditures for the General fund as well as the five year forecast.

04:03.780 --> 04:07.104
And we will also go over some updates on the outcome

04:07.152 --> 04:10.340
based budgeting. Next slide.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.456
Again, this is a forward looking statement so that everybody's aware

04:15.488 --> 04:19.224
this is still based on the projections. Any changes in the futures will impact our

04:19.262 --> 04:23.268
numbers. This is again the five year forecast based on our assumptions

04:23.444 --> 04:27.320
that we can derive today. Next Slides

04:30.700 --> 04:33.080
let's start with the citywide expenditures,

04:33.500 --> 04:37.064
including debt service and pay as you go in this slide.

04:37.112 --> 04:40.904
As you see, the fiscal year 23 proposed budget for all funds,

04:40.952 --> 04:44.652
including debt service and pay as you go is at $5.7

04:44.706 --> 04:49.072
billion. This is about $487,000,000

04:49.126 --> 04:52.784
higher than fiscal year 22 current budget at 5.2

04:52.822 --> 04:56.710
billion. This is an increase of 9.31%.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.768
Again, keep in mind this citywide expenditures

05:00.864 --> 05:05.216
includes total budget, includes general funds, special and enterprise funds.

05:05.248 --> 05:08.180
This does not include the surface chargeback funds,

05:09.320 --> 05:13.492
the enterprise funds, as you see in this slide, the enterprise funds accounts

05:13.556 --> 05:18.328
for about 364,000,000 of that $487,000,000

05:18.414 --> 05:22.356
increase. If you see in here, the water and sewer had increased

05:22.388 --> 05:25.480
from 1.3 billion to 1.6 billion alone,

05:25.640 --> 05:29.660
and that is related to the consent decree and other drinking water projects.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.900
In fiscal year 23, General Fund alone accounts for about

05:33.970 --> 05:37.584
48% of the city total funds. And as you

05:37.622 --> 05:40.784
see in here, there's a slight decrease from fiscal year 22

05:40.822 --> 05:45.600
to reflect the total compositions of the funds from 51%

05:45.670 --> 05:49.510
to 48%. Again, because of the increased allocations on the

05:50.040 --> 05:53.904
combined utility system on the General Fund, it increased

05:53.952 --> 05:57.824
by 101,000,000, or about 3.85%

05:57.882 --> 06:01.560
increase, which we will go through more details later on next slide.

06:04.860 --> 06:08.616
Again, this is the citywide full time equivalent for

06:08.718 --> 06:11.944
civilians and classified. As you

06:11.982 --> 06:15.884
see in here, the total FTEs we have for fiscal year 23

06:16.002 --> 06:19.784
is at 21,000, a slight

06:19.832 --> 06:22.664
decrease from fiscal year 22 current budget.

06:22.792 --> 06:26.348
Again, as mentioned by the Mayor yesterday, the fiscal

06:26.364 --> 06:30.304
year 23 proposed includes cadet classes for police and

06:30.342 --> 06:33.948
fire for five classes each. While in fiscal

06:33.964 --> 06:37.596
year 22 current budget, it includes six cadet classes for police

06:37.628 --> 06:41.344
and four cadet classes for fire. Another important notes

06:41.392 --> 06:45.030
to put in the fiscal year 23 proposed budget. In here. The general fund

06:45.560 --> 06:49.208
includes temporary employees for the Higher Houston Youth Program. So you

06:49.214 --> 06:53.400
will see some of those numbers incorporated in the General Fund FTEs.

06:54.460 --> 06:55.640
Next slide.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.936
Again, this is another deep dive of the General Fund compositions

07:02.968 --> 07:06.456
from the civilian and classified from fiscal

07:06.488 --> 07:09.836
year 15 to fiscal year 23.

07:10.018 --> 07:13.772
Again, another thing to point in here, keep in mind the fiscal year

07:13.826 --> 07:17.664
2020 and fiscal year 21 FTEs seems

07:17.702 --> 07:21.056
to be lower. Again, this is due to the redeployment that

07:21.078 --> 07:23.330
was funded out of CRF at that time.

07:24.580 --> 07:25.680
Next slide.

07:28.500 --> 07:32.304
So this is the American rescue plan act. As you all know, this fiscal

07:32.352 --> 07:36.384
year 23 proposed budget also includes funding from the ARPA,

07:36.432 --> 07:40.116
similar to what we did last year. Again, this is just a

07:40.138 --> 07:43.764
reminder. ARPA was signed into law March 11,

07:43.812 --> 07:46.904
2021, providing 65.1

07:46.942 --> 07:50.712
billion federal funding. Our portion for the City of Houston is about

07:50.766 --> 07:54.756
$607.8 million in two tranches. So we

07:54.798 --> 07:59.500
received the first tranche last year around May of $303,000,000.

07:59.570 --> 08:02.892
So we will be expecting the second tranche sometime this month.

08:02.946 --> 08:07.036
Hopefully we have not yet received it. It is typically stated

08:07.068 --> 08:10.464
to be twelve months after the first tranche. The city would

08:10.502 --> 08:14.112
have until December 31, 2024 to use

08:14.166 --> 08:17.220
the fund. Again. Unlike CRF,

08:17.560 --> 08:21.456
ARPA recognizes the economic impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic

08:21.488 --> 08:24.784
and provides flexibility to address reductions in revenues

08:24.912 --> 08:29.296
due to the COVID-19 Public health emergency. The Coronavirus

08:29.328 --> 08:33.416
State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund final rule was available by

08:33.438 --> 08:37.592
the US. Treasury. Released on January 2022.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.920
So this budget includes 160.1 million

08:40.990 --> 08:44.670
in the ARPA utilization for the provisions of the government services

08:45.040 --> 08:48.172
relative to the revenue reductions due to COVID-19 public

08:48.226 --> 08:52.140
health emergency. Next slide.

08:56.020 --> 08:59.600
Okay, so a quick overview of the General

08:59.670 --> 09:03.052
Fund that we are proposing today. This budget

09:03.116 --> 09:07.068
includes 13.5% fund balance of the expenditures, less debt

09:07.084 --> 09:10.656
service and pay as you go, which is above the desired minimum

09:10.688 --> 09:14.804
of 7.5%, and that is about $138,000,000

09:15.002 --> 09:18.976
above the 7.5%. This budget includes

09:19.008 --> 09:22.020
3% pay raises for the municipal employees,

09:22.180 --> 09:25.832
6% pay raises for the firefighters and 4%

09:25.886 --> 09:29.284
pay raises for the police. Classified this proposed

09:29.332 --> 09:32.732
budget fully fund the budget stabilization fund. So right now we are over

09:32.786 --> 09:36.190
$20 million set aside for the Budget Stabilization Fund.

09:36.640 --> 09:40.776
Again, as mentioned, this funds for cadet classes, five cadet

09:40.808 --> 09:43.896
classes each in police and fire, and also fully

09:43.928 --> 09:47.216
fund all three pension systems. So this budget does not include fund

09:47.238 --> 09:51.840
balance drawdown, nor one time land sales, nor payment deferrals.

09:55.460 --> 09:58.340
So let's start with the General Fund revenues.

09:58.840 --> 10:03.136
So this is the net change of the General Fund revenues including

10:03.168 --> 10:06.820
other sources. So that includes sale of land and transfers.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.240
Compared to the fiscal year 22 estimates, the proposed budget

10:11.580 --> 10:15.432
increased by about 2.4%. So our 2.7

10:15.486 --> 10:19.272
million compared to the fiscal year 22 estimates of 2.67

10:19.326 --> 10:22.908
million. Let's start with the biggest increase which

10:22.914 --> 10:24.990
is from the bottom, which is property tax,

10:25.520 --> 10:28.892
$48.8 million increase. And again,

10:28.946 --> 10:32.940
this is based on Proposition One and

10:33.010 --> 10:37.184
H limitations that we have, which is based on the populations plus

10:37.222 --> 10:40.496
CPI. Keep in mind the CPI is already available at this

10:40.518 --> 10:44.064
point at 4.8%.

10:44.182 --> 10:47.456
The population is still at 0% assumptions waiting

10:47.488 --> 10:51.156
until the US census Bureau released it sometimes in

10:51.178 --> 10:55.124
May. Intergovernmental this has increased by

10:55.162 --> 10:58.064
10.4 million compared to fiscal year 22 estimates.

10:58.112 --> 11:01.432
Again, this is where you see the use of

11:01.486 --> 11:04.644
the ARPA funding, which is 160,000,000 compared

11:04.692 --> 11:08.424
to fiscal year 22. We use about 139 million.

11:08.622 --> 11:12.712
So roughly those are increases in the intergovernmental.

11:12.856 --> 11:16.172
We also reflect transfer from other funds increased by 3.8

11:16.226 --> 11:20.648
million. This is mainly from the Park Houston funds.

11:20.744 --> 11:24.604
As economies start going back to normal,

11:24.652 --> 11:28.092
so you will see some of those parking fees generated

11:28.156 --> 11:31.596
and so the transfers start coming to increase in fiscal

11:31.628 --> 11:34.610
year 23 charges for services,

11:35.860 --> 11:39.364
this is increased due to higher than anticipated digital network and

11:39.402 --> 11:43.844
network notes. We also have others that

11:43.882 --> 11:47.204
is noted in here. This is because of the interest you see all those

11:47.322 --> 11:50.536
low interest in last year. But now with

11:50.558 --> 11:54.436
the increased cash that we have, we are projecting an increased

11:54.548 --> 11:57.770
interest in our fiscal year 23.

11:58.540 --> 12:01.948
Another decrease in here I'm going to go through the decreases is the

12:01.954 --> 12:06.412
franchise fees. This is again mainly on the telephone franchise that

12:06.466 --> 12:09.980
continues to decline. Next slide.

12:12.960 --> 12:17.008
Again, this is just a composition allocations in the general fund

12:17.094 --> 12:20.496
revenue categories between fiscal year 23 proposed and

12:20.518 --> 12:23.644
fiscal year 22 estimates. Again the biggest

12:23.692 --> 12:27.492
chunk that we have in our revenue sources are two.

12:27.546 --> 12:32.228
Property tax and sales tax continue to be our

12:32.314 --> 12:35.684
primary sources that compose about 67

12:35.802 --> 12:38.550
70% of the general fund.

12:39.720 --> 12:43.112
We also have the other funds and franchise fees as noted in here. Again,

12:43.166 --> 12:46.824
keep in mind this revenues includes the funding from ARPA of

12:46.862 --> 12:49.720
160,000,000 in the intergovernmental.

12:50.700 --> 12:51.880
Next slide.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.924
Again, this is just another different look on a

12:58.962 --> 13:03.432
bar chart and you could see the comparison

13:03.496 --> 13:07.024
from fiscal year 15 all the way to fiscal year 23

13:07.062 --> 13:10.896
proposed budget for the property tax, sales tax, franchise and

13:10.918 --> 13:14.464
other revenues. You could see some

13:14.502 --> 13:18.852
of those dip in fiscal year 2020 and

13:18.906 --> 13:22.516
21 slight movement because again because of

13:22.538 --> 13:26.500
the COVID Next slide

13:32.540 --> 13:35.656
on the property tax revenues. Again this

13:35.678 --> 13:39.992
is based on the estimated taxable value of $289,000,000,000,

13:40.046 --> 13:42.830
which is an increase of 8.98%.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.972
This estimated taxable value is the net off the tax

13:47.026 --> 13:51.580
incremental agreements which is 246.2 billion.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.696
Again, population data from the US Census Bureau as of July 1

13:56.738 --> 13:59.792
has yet to be received. So our property tax

13:59.846 --> 14:03.164
revenues in here is only based on the CPI index

14:03.212 --> 14:08.180
of 4.3%. I misspoke, I said 4.8 is 4.28%

14:08.330 --> 14:12.212
initially and we will adjust this calculations once

14:12.266 --> 14:16.070
the US Census Bureau data is available by the end of May.

14:17.080 --> 14:21.880
So with that the increased property tax revenues is at 3.97%,

14:22.030 --> 14:25.336
which is 48.9 million higher than fiscal year

14:25.358 --> 14:28.712
22 estimates. Again, this is still based

14:28.766 --> 14:32.376
on the over 65 and disabled exemptions at 160,000

14:32.398 --> 14:35.864
and I know Mayor had mentioned yesterday that he proposed

14:35.912 --> 14:39.836
to increase that over 65 and disabled exemptions from

14:39.858 --> 14:43.900
160,000 to 260,000 in a separate

14:44.660 --> 14:47.440
council actions, sometimes in June.

14:49.220 --> 14:54.342
Next slide again,

14:54.396 --> 14:57.934
so this is based on the budget versus

14:58.002 --> 15:01.814
actual of the property tax revenues from fiscal year 19

15:01.862 --> 15:05.654
to fiscal year 23. Again, the adopted

15:05.702 --> 15:09.110
budget since fiscal year 15 is based on the proposition

15:09.190 --> 15:12.750
one plus H and you could see the delta between

15:12.820 --> 15:16.554
those with the actual. So fiscal year 22 estimates

15:16.602 --> 15:19.642
right now is not projected to be changing,

15:19.706 --> 15:24.014
so we are still remaining our projections at the revenue

15:24.062 --> 15:27.534
cap and again fiscal year 23 proposed

15:27.582 --> 15:29.940
budget is also at the revenue cap.

15:31.350 --> 15:32.530
Next slide.

15:37.450 --> 15:41.346
And you've seen this before, this is just a chart

15:41.378 --> 15:46.550
to show the impact of the charter cap to

15:46.620 --> 15:50.250
what we have at this time since fiscal year

15:50.320 --> 15:54.122
17. So again since fiscal year 19 we already hit

15:54.176 --> 15:57.530
the property revenue cap where we were based

15:57.600 --> 16:01.270
on the populations plus CPI growth

16:01.430 --> 16:05.182
in our revenues. But if we did not have that

16:05.236 --> 16:08.990
so you could see in here the impact of that is about 1.4

16:09.060 --> 16:12.866
billion from fiscal year 15. The impact of

16:12.888 --> 16:16.802
the prop the revenue cap we have for fiscal year 23

16:16.856 --> 16:20.500
as you see in there is at $282,000,000.

16:24.970 --> 16:27.640
Next slide. Thank you.

16:28.650 --> 16:32.022
Moving on to the sales tax revenues. Again,

16:32.076 --> 16:35.462
we are conservative as we are heading into fiscal year 23

16:35.516 --> 16:39.286
budget. So we keep our percentage growth for

16:39.308 --> 16:41.030
sales tax flat.

16:43.050 --> 16:46.746
This estimate reflect an improvement to the economic conditions compared to

16:46.768 --> 16:50.826
fiscal year 2021 which was severely impacted by COVID-19

16:50.858 --> 16:54.794
Pandemic which affected our national and global

16:54.922 --> 16:58.334
economy. So although the energy sector has

16:58.372 --> 17:02.250
contributed significantly to the Houston economy, the ongoing volatility

17:02.330 --> 17:06.130
of the Russian's invasions of Ukraine has caused uncertainties

17:06.630 --> 17:10.002
among the oil industry. So current average oil price

17:10.056 --> 17:13.250
is at 109.77 per barrel. This is

17:13.320 --> 17:16.834
as of May 6. So therefore the proposed budget assumes

17:16.882 --> 17:19.910
no growth from the fiscal year 22 estimates.

17:22.410 --> 17:25.926
And when we look at Dr. Gilmer which

17:25.948 --> 17:29.906
is our consultants on the sales tax and the economists who's

17:29.938 --> 17:33.350
from the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the UFH,

17:33.790 --> 17:38.346
he projected the fiscal year 23 range for the city sales tax

17:38.528 --> 17:42.686
ranging from the low of 773 to 812,000,000.

17:42.788 --> 17:45.854
So we are somewhat in the middle at this point. Again,

17:45.892 --> 17:50.058
it's a lot of moving factors

17:50.234 --> 17:54.106
going forward. So we want to be conservative and just we leave it as flat

17:54.138 --> 17:57.586
at this point from fiscal year 22 estimates we had seen, of course,

17:57.608 --> 18:01.122
as you all see it every single month are projecting increasing in the sales tax

18:01.176 --> 18:04.740
as we receive more receipts in this year.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.326
But again, we don't know what we don't know. So we want to leave it

18:08.348 --> 18:12.082
flat at this time. Next slide.

18:12.146 --> 18:15.830
Okay, so this is the trends on the sales tax. Again, sales tax

18:15.900 --> 18:19.290
is very volatile. It changes

18:19.440 --> 18:23.130
very quickly as the economy shifted.

18:23.470 --> 18:27.322
You see what happened with the Pandemic. So with the drop in

18:27.376 --> 18:30.554
state home, so that revenues which would decrease

18:30.602 --> 18:34.174
tremendously. So again comparison from

18:34.212 --> 18:37.534
fiscal year 19 where we are at with

18:37.572 --> 18:38.720
our sales tax.

18:44.610 --> 18:47.970
So now we're moving on to the John Fund expenditures.

18:48.390 --> 18:51.602
So again, this is the net change from fiscal year 20

18:51.656 --> 18:55.510
to current budget. So we are reflecting about 3.85%

18:55.580 --> 18:59.686
increase in the general fund of 2.7 billion compared to

18:59.708 --> 19:03.990
the 2.6 billion major changes

19:04.060 --> 19:08.070
we have in there is on the operating budget.

19:08.410 --> 19:12.106
Again, it includes the employee compensations. So that is

19:12.128 --> 19:15.530
an increase of 44.6 million. So that is on the fire,

19:15.600 --> 19:19.482
police and municipal pay raises also have the

19:19.536 --> 19:23.982
surface chargeback funds. This is restricted accounts of 18.35

19:24.036 --> 19:29.902
million health benefits includes about 14.7

19:29.956 --> 19:33.934
million increases in here other surface

19:33.982 --> 19:37.742
chargeback and I know we put that note in there is for the contract

19:37.806 --> 19:41.794
escalations and new facility operating cost we

19:41.832 --> 19:45.694
also project some savings in this proposed

19:45.742 --> 19:49.382
budget, mainly on the pension. So you see

19:49.436 --> 19:53.446
the pension and note four showing a reduction of

19:53.468 --> 19:57.234
2.3 million. This is because of the rate changes from the midpoint

19:57.282 --> 20:01.414
to the minimum point for the fire pension as they are falling

20:01.462 --> 20:03.900
below the minimum corridor at this point.

20:04.430 --> 20:08.074
And also deferral. If you recall our

20:08.112 --> 20:12.010
budget in fiscal year 2000 and 22,021 includes

20:12.170 --> 20:15.040
deferral for the Walker lease building.

20:15.410 --> 20:19.166
So now we don't have deferral anymore. So we only pay what

20:19.188 --> 20:23.140
we are owed on an annual basis. So that shows some saving

20:24.470 --> 20:28.674
on the debt service and payers to go, it increased by 22.6

20:28.712 --> 20:32.574
million. Again, some of that is pertaining to the captured

20:32.622 --> 20:36.658
revenues pay go as increase in the CPIs included

20:36.674 --> 20:40.230
in that calculation as well and also

20:40.380 --> 20:43.862
transfer of the debt service. Now this does not include any

20:43.916 --> 20:47.442
prepayment from the building inspections. If you recall our previous

20:47.586 --> 20:51.222
budget includes debt prepayment for the building inspection funds.

20:51.286 --> 20:54.774
So this is not including that. So you will see some of those uptick

20:54.822 --> 20:58.294
because of no longer debt prepayment from the building inspections included

20:58.342 --> 21:01.710
in this debt service transfers.

21:03.250 --> 21:06.494
Next slide. Okay,

21:06.532 --> 21:10.778
again, this is just a comparison of the allocated

21:10.954 --> 21:15.038
general fund expenditures including debt service from fiscal year 23 to fiscal

21:15.054 --> 21:19.374
year 22. Again, public safety still remains the bulk

21:19.422 --> 21:22.260
of the compositions in the general fund.

21:23.030 --> 21:26.930
Police and fire alone is at $1.55 billion.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.194
So compared to this $2.7 billion proposed budget,

21:30.242 --> 21:33.718
police and fire alone includes about 56.4% of the

21:33.724 --> 21:37.334
total budget. Another one that I want to point

21:37.372 --> 21:41.754
out in here is the debt service or the debt service which

21:41.792 --> 21:45.334
is pledged with the property tax revenues

21:45.382 --> 21:48.780
that we have is about 13% of our

21:49.870 --> 21:53.246
general fund budget. 3% is the pay as you

21:53.268 --> 21:56.990
go and you see the remaining is those other departments

21:58.050 --> 22:02.670
including Solid Waste. I think Solid Waste is in one of those other departments.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.490
Next slides.

22:09.110 --> 22:13.170
So this is the compositions of the personnel versus non personnel.

22:14.550 --> 22:18.200
Now overall again our general fund,

22:18.890 --> 22:23.510
62% is personnel, I know we kind of mentioned that earlier,

22:23.850 --> 22:27.320
62% is personnel, 38% is in others.

22:27.710 --> 22:30.922
Out of that 62 personnel, 76 of that

22:30.976 --> 22:35.482
is classified police and fire. Only 24%

22:35.536 --> 22:39.226
is civilians. Again, going back to the others

22:39.408 --> 22:42.670
portion of the 38% debt service

22:42.740 --> 22:46.094
is about 42%. You have the energy costs in there and

22:46.132 --> 22:47.790
other service and chargeback.

22:49.810 --> 22:50.910
Next slide.

22:54.690 --> 22:58.414
So this is a slide just to go through the general fund pension contributions.

22:58.462 --> 23:01.586
I know Mayor had mentioned the pension reform was

23:01.608 --> 23:05.346
done in 2017. So from the unfunded liability point of

23:05.368 --> 23:09.266
view, the pension reform in 2017 reduced the projected unfunded

23:09.298 --> 23:13.430
liability from 8.2 billion to 1.5 billion.

23:13.770 --> 23:17.730
That is reduction about 6.7 billion from the liability

23:17.810 --> 23:21.500
point of view. But what you see in here in this chart is

23:22.030 --> 23:25.690
the projected city pension contributions without

23:25.760 --> 23:29.386
the reform. So if you look at this, the shaded area

23:29.488 --> 23:32.894
in there without the reform we would have had to set

23:32.932 --> 23:36.746
aside another 1.4 billion on the operating funds

23:36.778 --> 23:38.910
to pay for those city contributions.

23:40.770 --> 23:43.946
Again, the full impact from stiscalyte

23:43.978 --> 23:47.474
18 on the city general fund contribution is

23:47.512 --> 23:50.738
about 1.4 billion, if not because of the

23:50.744 --> 23:54.130
pension reform. Next slide

23:55.110 --> 23:58.834
so finally, this is the general fund unassigned ending fund balance.

23:58.962 --> 24:02.822
So as mentioned, so we are now at 13.46%

24:02.876 --> 24:08.262
13.5%. We are at 310.7

24:08.316 --> 24:12.730
million fund balance. So that is about $138,000,000

24:12.800 --> 24:16.374
above the 7.5%. But one thing I do want to note

24:16.422 --> 24:19.674
in here, the fiscal year 22 and

24:19.712 --> 24:23.914
the fiscal year 23 fund balance in here includes ARPA

24:23.962 --> 24:26.910
funding that is not recurring.

24:27.410 --> 24:31.578
So I cannot stress enough on the important to preserve

24:31.594 --> 24:35.440
fund balance because of what's coming ahead in fiscal year 25.

24:36.050 --> 24:39.762
Another thing to put in here, fiscal year 18 amount requires 7.5%.

24:39.816 --> 24:43.890
Fund balance is adjusted to exclude the 910,000,000

24:43.960 --> 24:47.270
pension obligation bond. This is back in fiscal year 18.

24:48.090 --> 24:49.270
Next slide.

24:53.770 --> 24:56.870
So now we're moving to the general fund five year forecast.

24:57.690 --> 25:01.062
Again, this is a forecast which has some assumptions

25:01.126 --> 25:03.180
in the next five years at this point,

25:03.790 --> 25:07.178
but hopefully it would give some ideas of where we're going

25:07.184 --> 25:10.714
to be in the next five years. Again, this projected

25:10.762 --> 25:14.606
gap range based on the conservative and

25:14.628 --> 25:18.318
optimistic growth in revenues, it does not include any

25:18.404 --> 25:22.106
one time land sales for our revenues

25:22.298 --> 25:25.826
property tax revenues. It is in compliance with Propositions One and

25:25.848 --> 25:31.122
Eight limitations holding. The senior disabled exemptions at 160,000 and

25:31.176 --> 25:35.258
the pension assumption is based on and this is to be corrected

25:35.454 --> 25:39.046
based on either minimum or midpoint of the

25:39.068 --> 25:43.090
corridor because of the conditions of those pension groups

25:43.250 --> 25:46.194
on the expenditures. Also includes legal mandates,

25:46.322 --> 25:51.162
staffing for new facilities and contractual escalators starting

25:51.216 --> 25:53.530
with the revenues. Next slide.

25:55.470 --> 25:59.514
So I've talked about what is in the assumptions for the

25:59.552 --> 26:03.450
fiscal year 23 proposed budget. So roughly,

26:03.530 --> 26:07.006
property tax growth is about 4%. Again, the driver of

26:07.028 --> 26:10.814
that is the CPI is the CPI growth rate.

26:11.012 --> 26:14.606
We have not including any populations growth rate. So this is

26:14.628 --> 26:18.254
still based on the 0% populations which will be updated

26:18.302 --> 26:21.522
once we have this data by the end of May. Again,

26:21.576 --> 26:24.874
sales tax growth rates in fiscal year 23 remain

26:24.942 --> 26:29.014
flat. Franchise fees overall its

26:29.052 --> 26:32.626
reduction of 1.2%. Again, bulk of that is the telephone

26:32.658 --> 26:36.742
franchise fees that continues to decline. We also have other

26:36.796 --> 26:40.394
revenue growth at 3.7%. This is on the

26:40.512 --> 26:44.300
Industrial Assessment license and permits as we have seen some

26:44.670 --> 26:48.698
revenue increases in fiscal year 22 as the economy started to pick up

26:48.864 --> 26:52.206
and no one time land sales in here. So you

26:52.228 --> 26:55.854
see the projection from fiscal year 24 to 27,

26:56.052 --> 27:00.110
which is based on the low and the high for our assumptions.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.350
Next slide.

27:05.890 --> 27:09.498
On the expenditure side, again, we've gone through the fiscal

27:09.514 --> 27:11.870
year 23 assumptions.

27:12.210 --> 27:15.070
Police is based on a 4% increase,

27:15.490 --> 27:18.782
fire is based on a 6% increase, pay raises,

27:18.926 --> 27:22.930
municipal Employees is based on a 3% increase

27:23.750 --> 27:27.474
and we've gone through the pension contributions for

27:27.512 --> 27:31.266
fiscal year 23 which is known at this point, is at

27:31.288 --> 27:35.030
the 8.44 for Hmaps which is based on the midpoint.

27:35.450 --> 27:39.206
Again, we also have the legacy pension that

27:39.228 --> 27:41.558
we have to pay to Hmaps at 142,000,000.

27:41.564 --> 27:45.306
H Pops is based on

27:45.328 --> 27:48.410
31.98, which is the midpoint at this point,

27:48.560 --> 27:52.186
and the Fire pension at 26.89 which

27:52.208 --> 27:55.526
is at the minimum point of the corridor.

27:55.718 --> 27:58.990
We have the growth assumption for health benefits at 4%,

27:59.060 --> 28:02.686
which is known at this point. And again the debt service and pays you

28:02.708 --> 28:06.138
go as described earlier. Now going to fiscal

28:06.154 --> 28:10.114
year 24 to 27, this is our assumptions going forward.

28:10.312 --> 28:13.586
We know what has already been in the meet and

28:13.608 --> 28:17.634
confer with police which is 3% 24 and

28:17.672 --> 28:21.442
3.5% 25. So we're not using

28:21.496 --> 28:24.754
any assumptions in the future at this point, which is at TBD.

28:24.882 --> 28:28.934
At this point Fire is 6% in 24 and

28:29.052 --> 28:32.902
TBD. So we just remain at that point for these assumptions

28:33.046 --> 28:36.358
and another 3% in 24 for municipal

28:36.534 --> 28:40.954
employees. Again, H maps for

28:41.152 --> 28:44.730
24 to 27 is based on the midpoint of corridor.

28:45.650 --> 28:49.354
Police and Fire is going to be looking at the minimum.

28:49.402 --> 28:54.334
So we have a range of minimum and midpoint because

28:54.372 --> 28:58.014
they are getting close to the minimum corridor. So we are making some

28:58.052 --> 29:01.966
assumptions at this point because it's still a moving number. So we're making this range

29:01.998 --> 29:05.714
for police and Fire again on the health

29:05.752 --> 29:09.314
benefits because it's still assumptions going forward. We also do a

29:09.352 --> 29:12.820
range on the growth for the health benefits

29:13.590 --> 29:16.886
five to 7% and the debt service of

29:16.908 --> 29:21.046
course is based on our debt service models which is planned payment

29:21.148 --> 29:24.666
for the next five years. So with that

29:24.848 --> 29:28.314
we go to the next slide so we could map this out and

29:28.352 --> 29:31.894
take a look at what the gap

29:31.942 --> 29:33.980
is going to look like. Next slide, please.

29:36.690 --> 29:40.222
So this is roughly what we're looking at in the next five years.

29:40.276 --> 29:44.110
Keep in mind this does not include ARPA funding

29:44.530 --> 29:49.098
so I don't want to skew our visibility

29:49.194 --> 29:52.994
with mixing the ARPA funding in these discussions. As you see

29:53.032 --> 29:56.894
in fiscal year 23 you have about $160,000,000 gap

29:56.942 --> 30:00.570
so that's what ARPA funding came in and fiscal

30:00.590 --> 30:04.242
year 24 does not include ARPA fundings in this scenario

30:04.306 --> 30:08.406
as well. So that is something that we will be incorporating in

30:08.428 --> 30:11.778
next fiscal year and going forward you

30:11.804 --> 30:15.180
have an idea what our range of

30:15.870 --> 30:20.262
gap looks like. Again, this is not using any utilizations

30:20.326 --> 30:24.650
of ARPA funding. Next slide.

30:26.370 --> 30:30.062
So let's take a look back and

30:30.196 --> 30:33.866
see what have we done as a city. I know you've

30:33.898 --> 30:37.166
all seen the PFM studies and so I

30:37.188 --> 30:41.230
do want to put forth what has been done

30:41.300 --> 30:44.306
to see where we are at today because if this is not done then we

30:44.328 --> 30:47.540
would have been in a much worse situations at this point.

30:47.910 --> 30:51.634
So one thing's first of course is the pension reform that was done 2017.

30:51.682 --> 30:55.720
You saw what the impact if that was not done

30:56.170 --> 30:59.154
in that city contributions and unfunded liabilities,

30:59.282 --> 31:02.646
OPAP reform. So we had seen some reductions in the unfunded

31:02.678 --> 31:06.106
liabilities. Shared services we have

31:06.128 --> 31:09.818
done on the joint processing center. We have shared services with

31:09.824 --> 31:13.580
the Harris County, of course, continuing hiring control

31:13.950 --> 31:16.560
through the Mayor staffing Efficiencies program.

31:17.170 --> 31:20.314
You've seen all the claw back provisions

31:20.362 --> 31:23.680
that we had implemented a couple of years ago.

31:24.690 --> 31:28.302
You've seen the EMSC adjustments that went to council

31:28.446 --> 31:31.714
several years ago as well. And of course the health

31:31.752 --> 31:35.582
benefits update, negotiated Cdwat medical and prescriptions

31:35.646 --> 31:38.882
benefits plans, implemented Spousal surcharge if you've all seen

31:38.936 --> 31:42.522
it, and also perform the dependent eligibility audit

31:42.606 --> 31:46.258
and there's maybe other stuff that has been done. So these are the major items

31:46.274 --> 31:49.750
that I do want to highlight before we go to the next slides.

31:50.730 --> 31:54.290
Next slide. So again, what's next? Again,

31:54.380 --> 31:57.962
it's important to understand what we work with at this point.

31:58.096 --> 32:02.202
We do have the limitations on the property tax revenue cap, in city

32:02.256 --> 32:05.950
charter and state cap. So not just the city's local

32:06.020 --> 32:09.680
cap, but there's also state cap that we have to work and comply with.

32:10.610 --> 32:14.574
Another limitation is public safety. It is something to

32:14.772 --> 32:18.258
note that police and fire costs make up about 57% of the

32:18.264 --> 32:21.694
general fund and also COVID impact.

32:21.742 --> 32:25.426
So which is the economic uncertainties that we are dealing with at

32:25.448 --> 32:28.802
this point. COVID and of course what happened

32:28.856 --> 32:32.594
in Russian invasions to Ukraine. So that would impact

32:32.642 --> 32:36.070
the oil prices, again, the volatility in the economy.

32:37.130 --> 32:40.726
So on the short terms, it is important for us

32:40.748 --> 32:44.646
to build and preserve fund balance. Again, to be conservative,

32:44.838 --> 32:48.934
continue to leverage ARPA funding, to address revenue losses, continue hiring

32:48.982 --> 32:52.406
control and also look for efficiencies and cost cutting

32:52.438 --> 32:56.414
opportunities, developing new revenue sources. And I

32:56.612 --> 32:59.710
briefly mentioned that in the press conference yesterday.

33:00.370 --> 33:04.334
And again continue working day one to build the fund balance as

33:04.372 --> 33:07.940
we had into fiscal year 23, 24 and 25.

33:08.390 --> 33:11.730
In the long terms, again, continue to look into those

33:11.880 --> 33:15.442
implementing PFM recommendations that are supported by both

33:15.496 --> 33:19.154
mayor and yourself, city Council in

33:19.192 --> 33:22.694
which one of that, as you had seen in the past, is the outcome based

33:22.732 --> 33:26.360
budgeting. So we are in the progress to do that.

33:26.970 --> 33:30.806
And so with that we have an

33:30.828 --> 33:34.818
update on the outcome based budgeting and I would refer to Deputy

33:34.834 --> 33:36.330
Director William Jones.

33:38.270 --> 33:41.466
All right. Thank you, Director. And to Mayor Pro TEM and

33:41.488 --> 33:45.146
Council. Time to switch pace a little bit, talk about something a

33:45.168 --> 33:48.686
little fun, at least it is to me. So this is a project I've been

33:48.708 --> 33:54.846
very close to since this

33:54.868 --> 33:57.898
is a project I've been close to since about 2011 twelve.

33:58.084 --> 34:01.346
We've been making small incremental progress throughout the

34:01.368 --> 34:04.818
years, but now I'm excited that we've actually

34:04.904 --> 34:08.274
launched this project. So last summer we kicked off phase one

34:08.392 --> 34:12.520
of the outcome based budgeting project. So if you can bring up the slides please.

34:14.090 --> 34:17.334
Okay, so in phase one, it was

34:17.372 --> 34:20.934
essentially a discovery phase. So we brought in the consultant to come in and look

34:20.972 --> 34:24.154
at our process, look at our systems, look at our technology,

34:24.352 --> 34:27.658
and do an assessment. And with that,

34:27.744 --> 34:31.418
we had a lot of workshops with the departments. And like I said,

34:31.504 --> 34:35.466
throughout the years we had already been working with the departments, making what

34:35.488 --> 34:38.766
progress we could on what our programs and how do

34:38.788 --> 34:41.550
we start looking at our budget a little differently.

34:42.370 --> 34:45.626
From phase one, we conducted 45 workshops.

34:45.818 --> 34:50.606
We had over 100 plus participants. All 26 departments participated,

34:50.798 --> 34:54.126
and we were able to identify hundreds of programs.

34:54.318 --> 34:58.286
And we also looked at some different vendors on some technology solutions.

34:58.318 --> 35:01.442
So phase one was a very successful phase.

35:01.506 --> 35:04.934
So when you look at what does it mean

35:04.972 --> 35:08.198
to implement it successfully, what do we have to

35:08.204 --> 35:11.798
do? So we focused on three key things the people,

35:11.884 --> 35:15.526
technology and process. So those are some

35:15.548 --> 35:18.586
of the findings and recommendations that we looked at. So when you look at the

35:18.608 --> 35:21.834
people, one of the most important things is to have buy

35:21.872 --> 35:25.174
in at the very top, at the very top level with the mayor.

35:25.222 --> 35:27.806
And we definitely have to buy in from the mayor. One of the first things

35:27.828 --> 35:31.550
he did when he came in the office is signed Executive Order 150,

35:31.620 --> 35:35.114
which pretty much outlined a performance based budget

35:35.162 --> 35:38.766
model that the city would move towards. And we also have buy in from

35:38.788 --> 35:42.606
council. I know Councilman Alcorn has been very involved with it. We had an amendment,

35:42.638 --> 35:45.166
I want to say a couple of years ago that we would start that discovery

35:45.198 --> 35:47.700
phase. So we did complete that.

35:48.150 --> 35:51.346
And then not only at the top level, we have to have

35:51.448 --> 35:54.806
engagement with the employees, the managers, the people

35:54.828 --> 35:57.862
that are actually doing the work. And again, we've been doing that.

35:57.916 --> 36:01.586
So we want to keep that momentum that we've had throughout

36:01.618 --> 36:04.886
the year. So even with this budget, I work with

36:04.908 --> 36:08.646
departments to make sure they are thinking about their budget in terms of programs,

36:08.758 --> 36:12.026
have them start thinking of how they would measure those things. And I'll show

36:12.048 --> 36:15.002
you a really good example later in this presentation.

36:15.146 --> 36:18.320
So people is very important. Also technology.

36:19.090 --> 36:23.114
One of the things I found throughout my time of reviewing

36:23.162 --> 36:26.382
outcome based budget and performance based budget is that technology

36:26.516 --> 36:30.046
was a huge barrier for a lot of cities. I think now is

36:30.148 --> 36:33.938
the perfect time that the technology has advanced so much in the past five years.

36:34.024 --> 36:37.474
A lot of cloud based solutions, a lot of solutions that will allow us

36:37.512 --> 36:41.214
to track performance. And I presented with TTI,

36:41.262 --> 36:44.306
I think last month, along with his department,

36:44.498 --> 36:47.960
that we have found a solution that may work for us.

36:49.050 --> 36:52.226
So the technology, like I said, is a very important part. And we've

36:52.258 --> 36:55.786
made a lot of progress. The industry has made a lot of progress on that

36:55.808 --> 36:59.274
front. And probably one of. The most important thing is the process.

36:59.472 --> 37:02.666
So that's one of the key things we focused on,

37:02.848 --> 37:06.186
making sure because it's a major shift for the city to go from

37:06.288 --> 37:10.378
the incremental based budgeting to looking more at performance and focusing

37:10.394 --> 37:13.658
on outcomes. So process is one of the things we're

37:13.674 --> 37:16.190
going to spend a lot of time on in the second phase.

37:17.110 --> 37:20.706
Next slide please. So what's next? So the

37:20.728 --> 37:24.642
next phase, one of the first things, like I said, is focusing on

37:24.696 --> 37:28.980
the process. So redesign and introduce our budget process,

37:30.230 --> 37:33.746
starting with the strategic plan. So one of the major differences with outcome

37:33.778 --> 37:36.614
based budget is you start with your strategic plan,

37:36.732 --> 37:40.530
what are the outcomes that the citizens expect, what are the priorities

37:40.610 --> 37:44.214
of the city, and then we build from

37:44.252 --> 37:47.946
there. So we build our budget knowing what those goals are so

37:47.968 --> 37:51.606
that you know how to prioritize your budget and build your budget from the ground

37:51.638 --> 37:55.494
up. So in this next phase, it's going to be very important that we developed

37:55.542 --> 37:59.270
our process, document our process, change our budget calendar.

37:59.350 --> 38:03.018
We have to look at what new forms do we need to create. So that's

38:03.034 --> 38:06.206
going to be to me one of the most important process before we even get

38:06.228 --> 38:09.326
to the system, because you don't want to get a system and then you're still

38:09.348 --> 38:12.450
trying to figure out your process. You want to get a system, have your process

38:12.520 --> 38:15.970
in place and transition all that over first. So we're going to focus on process

38:16.040 --> 38:19.550
first and then you see on the second bullet, then we're

38:20.050 --> 38:23.894
going to look at implementing a comprehensive budget solution so that's the

38:23.932 --> 38:26.120
technology and the system that I talked about.

38:27.210 --> 38:31.250
And when you look at bullet point number three, then we integrate

38:31.330 --> 38:35.162
all of those solutions together, the process with the system

38:35.296 --> 38:38.634
and making sure everything works together. And then

38:38.672 --> 38:41.914
on number four, again, as I said, one of the most important things is

38:41.952 --> 38:45.686
people making sure that the employees, the managers, understand their role

38:45.718 --> 38:49.182
in this new budgeting format, understand that we need to

38:49.316 --> 38:52.846
track performance. A lot of departments already do

38:52.868 --> 38:56.526
it, but it doesn't drive decisions. So we're going to need to change that

38:56.548 --> 38:59.854
mentality to make sure that they're tracking performance for

38:59.892 --> 39:03.298
the outcomes that we expect and that we're monitoring those and measuring those.

39:03.384 --> 39:07.154
And then again, redefine the talent, provide staff with the support and

39:07.192 --> 39:11.154
resources that they need to be able to do that. This is not an easy

39:11.192 --> 39:14.758
thing and from what I've seen with other cities, they do have challenges. So we

39:14.764 --> 39:17.926
need to make sure that the staff has the support that they

39:17.948 --> 39:21.426
need to be able to track the goals

39:21.538 --> 39:24.774
and build the budget and have that buy in

39:24.812 --> 39:28.442
from the leadership to know that we're all moving in the same

39:28.496 --> 39:32.298
direction. Okay, so the next slide. So this is

39:32.304 --> 39:35.114
the one I really wanted to focus on to show you some of the work

39:35.152 --> 39:38.586
that we've done. So this is real data that we did with the Hits

39:38.618 --> 39:41.982
department. So it's a prototype, but it's based on real

39:42.036 --> 39:45.802
data. So we took their revolving fund budget,

39:45.866 --> 39:48.958
which is 98.1 million. So what they did, if you

39:48.964 --> 39:53.026
look at the very bottom, you'll see the programs. So we identified about

39:53.048 --> 39:56.466
13 programs within the Hits department. So if you're looking at it,

39:56.488 --> 40:00.514
you can see how much more relevant that the data is here.

40:00.552 --> 40:03.926
When you're looking at the budget, you can see looking at the first one

40:04.028 --> 40:07.334
citywide customer service, three one one program.

40:07.532 --> 40:11.126
People may not know that the Hits involvement with the Three One one program.

40:11.228 --> 40:14.726
And when we look at it from a global perspective, well, you know,

40:14.748 --> 40:18.186
three one one is in Ara as well. And then the goal is

40:18.208 --> 40:21.450
to be able to show how much are we spending on three one one.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.794
Then you start measuring what is the call time, how long does it take

40:24.832 --> 40:28.030
to respond, and then you can start measuring that to see, okay,

40:28.100 --> 40:31.678
are we performing accurately or do we need to

40:31.844 --> 40:35.694
put more money there or do we need to reassess? And then how long

40:35.732 --> 40:38.926
does it take for responses to be responded to

40:38.948 --> 40:42.258
by other departments? But until we have it's difficult to

40:42.264 --> 40:45.794
see in our current budget. But if we have program called Three one One that

40:45.832 --> 40:49.266
crosses other departments and we can see the total cost of what

40:49.288 --> 40:52.946
it is to run a three one one program, then we can make better decisions

40:52.978 --> 40:56.774
on how we fund those programs. So like I said, altogether it's about

40:56.812 --> 41:00.566
13 programs there. And then you go up to the next level.

41:00.748 --> 41:04.130
Now we're going to tie those programs into the priorities

41:04.210 --> 41:07.146
because right now, we don't know how much we're spending on the priorities of the

41:07.168 --> 41:10.266
city. So that'll be one of the big changes. And then you go up to

41:10.288 --> 41:13.290
the next level, and then we tie it to the plan.

41:13.360 --> 41:16.966
Houston, the core strategies, that the citizen survey,

41:16.998 --> 41:20.618
that what they expect. Right now, we can't tell them how much are we spending

41:20.714 --> 41:24.478
on sustaining quality infrastructure. Like I

41:24.484 --> 41:27.726
said, right now we're just looking at Hits. But once we get this

41:27.748 --> 41:31.326
entire thing up and running, then we can provide the citizens

41:31.358 --> 41:34.978
with better data to be able to understand where their dollars are going

41:35.064 --> 41:38.466
and also provide council with better information on how

41:38.488 --> 41:42.122
we can make decisions and fund these things. So like I said, I'm very excited

41:42.206 --> 41:45.890
that we've kicked this project off officially.

41:46.050 --> 41:49.090
Phase two is going to like it's going to be a challenge. So the goal

41:49.170 --> 41:52.566
is we're still aiming for FY 24 with the

41:52.588 --> 41:56.666
hopes of for sure having the process in place. Now, the system

41:56.768 --> 42:00.394
may take a little more time, but like I said, the process is the

42:00.432 --> 42:04.154
most important part. But we're definitely going to get a system, but without

42:04.192 --> 42:07.662
the process, to me, the system can wait, but we're moving forward

42:07.716 --> 42:10.782
with both. So by FY 24,

42:10.836 --> 42:14.782
we'll have some form of outcome based budgeting to present

42:14.836 --> 42:17.870
to you guys. So on the next slide,

42:18.690 --> 42:21.890
and this just shows you kind of how our reporting would look

42:21.960 --> 42:25.566
taking that same data with hits, you can see, you get the program description,

42:25.678 --> 42:29.506
what are the goals of that program, and then you'll see now we're starting to

42:29.528 --> 42:32.914
put measures tying it to those programs. And then

42:32.952 --> 42:36.290
throughout the year, we would have to track, are we hitting those targets?

42:36.370 --> 42:40.342
If not, then what do we need to do? So it's a different

42:40.396 --> 42:43.686
way of looking at your budget, not focusing on how much

42:43.708 --> 42:46.790
do we spend on this department, how much do we spend on that department,

42:46.870 --> 42:49.754
but what are the programs that we're providing to the citizens and how are they

42:49.792 --> 42:53.820
performing. So my hope is that not only do we change,

42:54.510 --> 42:58.422
provide the citizens with better information on how their dollars are being spent,

42:58.486 --> 43:01.870
but also kind of change how council can look at the budget and get away

43:01.940 --> 43:05.306
from the little line items here and there and the department spending

43:05.338 --> 43:09.054
there, and focus on those programs and start paying attention

43:09.102 --> 43:10.450
to what we're measuring.

43:12.710 --> 43:16.146
Okay, I think that's it for that. So before I turn

43:16.168 --> 43:20.054
it over to questions, I do want to take a moment to recognize my

43:20.092 --> 43:24.038
team. I had them put on their Sunday's Best in March over here.

43:24.124 --> 43:28.040
So I'm going to ask them to stand up, team. Stand up,

43:28.570 --> 43:29.720
all of you.

43:32.730 --> 43:36.258
These are the people that work nights and weekends

43:36.434 --> 43:39.658
to get this budget done. And all I had to do is bribe them with

43:39.664 --> 43:42.986
a little food and they put in the work. So to say

43:43.008 --> 43:46.090
I'm proud of them would be a huge understatement.

43:46.670 --> 43:50.074
And I've had the highest number of vacancies I've ever had going into a budget

43:50.122 --> 43:54.042
cycle, so they did triple the workload. And I am extremely

43:54.106 --> 43:56.560
proud of this group here. So thank you guys.

44:02.390 --> 44:05.650
The last 15 years I've been with the city, I think this is the least

44:05.720 --> 44:08.478
amount of teams we have to do the budget.

44:08.574 --> 44:11.800
So I'm very proud. Thank you so much.

44:14.170 --> 44:17.462
Retention. Retention. So we will burn people and they actually

44:17.516 --> 44:18.920
leave. That's what we have.

44:21.450 --> 44:25.414
You guys ready for questions? Yes. All right, you got the easy part over

44:25.452 --> 44:29.738
with. Here comes the tough part. So council member Sally Alcorn will start us off.

44:29.904 --> 44:33.226
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. And I did notice a slight uptick in

44:33.248 --> 44:36.560
the food line item for the Finance Department. Now I know why,

44:37.170 --> 44:40.926
but that's money well spent. And thank you guys for a great job. This is

44:40.948 --> 44:44.638
a really huge undertaking and

44:44.724 --> 44:48.542
will thank you for all the attention to outcome based

44:48.596 --> 44:52.450
budgeting. I just think that's going to be key to look at our

44:52.520 --> 44:56.306
programs and services that we provide. It's very difficult to see

44:56.328 --> 44:59.474
that in our current budget structure, and I think that will really help

44:59.512 --> 45:02.770
us to prioritize. So very happy about that. I'll just run through

45:02.840 --> 45:06.854
a few questions really quick. It's my understanding the $160,000,000 of

45:06.892 --> 45:10.246
ARPA funding that's being put in the 23 budget as part

45:10.268 --> 45:14.134
of the first tranche of money, correct? Correct.

45:14.252 --> 45:17.606
Okay. And the next tranche of money, you had a slide

45:17.638 --> 45:21.354
on there that says we must have this. Is it just committed by

45:21.392 --> 45:24.682
2024, end of 2024 and spent then

45:24.736 --> 45:28.702
by 2026, obligated by 24.

45:28.836 --> 45:33.118
Obligated by 24 and spent by end of year 2026.

45:33.204 --> 45:36.640
Yes. Okay. Thank you. On the inflation rate,

45:37.090 --> 45:40.546
you mentioned that a 4.8% number and a

45:40.568 --> 45:43.314
4.28% number 4.28. Okay.

45:43.352 --> 45:45.134
So for purposes of the rev,

45:45.182 --> 45:49.010
Captain, it's 4.28. The 4.8

45:49.080 --> 45:52.374
I misspoke. So I corrected myself. I get the four

45:52.412 --> 45:56.582
and the eight, but it's 4.28%. Okay. So we

45:56.636 --> 46:00.310
operate under the lesser of that inflation rate plus

46:00.380 --> 46:04.566
population, or four and a half percent. So right now we'd

46:04.598 --> 46:08.250
still be under CPI plus population when calculating that. Okay,

46:08.400 --> 46:12.140
thank you. And on the

46:14.830 --> 46:18.046
senior exemption, the 160,000 that the mayor announced would

46:18.068 --> 46:21.870
be going to 260,000. I believe that's not an assumption

46:22.450 --> 46:26.240
in the plan for this year. When would that kick in

46:27.410 --> 46:31.186
or have an effect? Right. So the

46:31.208 --> 46:34.914
senior tax exemptions and disabled will be in effect

46:35.032 --> 46:36.660
starting July 1.

46:39.590 --> 46:42.918
So that is not going to be impacting the budget because the budget is

46:42.924 --> 46:46.802
just based on the revenues. So that would be impacting

46:46.866 --> 46:50.306
the citizens when we actually look at the tax rates.

46:50.338 --> 46:54.294
Right. So they would have some savings. Got it. So that

46:54.332 --> 46:57.786
doesn't have any correct. Okay. In here. And then on

46:57.808 --> 47:00.890
the Hmeps legacy contribution, can you explain

47:00.960 --> 47:04.026
that again? I think you briefly touched on there were two categories on

47:04.048 --> 47:07.694
your assumptions for pensions. One was the legacy and

47:07.732 --> 47:10.240
one was just a rate. Can you?

47:11.330 --> 47:14.350
Yeah. So remember in that pension reform,

47:15.090 --> 47:18.466
one of the item that came out of

47:18.488 --> 47:22.370
that Senate bill on the municipal pensions,

47:23.030 --> 47:26.818
it's actually two portions. So there is a legacy amount which

47:26.824 --> 47:30.838
is based on a dollar agreement on the dollars payment for out years.

47:30.924 --> 47:33.800
Okay. And also a percent rate.

47:34.650 --> 47:38.166
Yeah, now I remember. Right. But not going to fire in pension is

47:38.188 --> 47:41.720
just based on the corridor midpoint. Thank you.

47:43.070 --> 47:44.890
Council member Abby Cayman.

47:50.270 --> 47:53.814
Sorry we're having to share Mikes. Director,

47:53.862 --> 47:59.226
thank you for your presentation to the entire team concerned

47:59.258 --> 48:02.606
about but for ARPA, where we would be in

48:02.628 --> 48:06.238
the projections and the gaps that you're showing in some of

48:06.244 --> 48:10.306
those slides, it's extremely concerning. Do we know and

48:10.328 --> 48:12.980
you may have already said this, but just for the public,

48:15.910 --> 48:19.794
how many projected dollars were not captured due to the

48:19.832 --> 48:23.106
revenue limitations in the cap that are

48:23.128 --> 48:24.260
currently in place?

48:26.970 --> 48:30.214
Thank you for bringing that up on slide 15.

48:30.332 --> 48:33.160
So that is the impact on the revenue cap.

48:33.770 --> 48:37.066
So the impact for fiscal year 23,

48:37.168 --> 48:40.906
if we don't have a cap, it would have been about 282,000,000 that

48:40.928 --> 48:44.266
we could have used to serve the

48:44.288 --> 48:47.546
city. So that is one of the

48:47.648 --> 48:51.214
items in your statements. So the other one is, if not

48:51.252 --> 48:54.458
for ARPA, then essentially you would have about $160,000,000 gap

48:54.474 --> 48:58.254
to close, which could impact public safety. And it was

48:58.292 --> 49:01.806
also striking on page 17 that since fiscal

49:01.838 --> 49:05.650
year 2015, the full impact of the property tax cap

49:05.720 --> 49:09.182
has been 1.818 excuse me, billion dollars.

49:09.256 --> 49:11.080
So thank you for providing that.

49:12.250 --> 49:15.590
You started to emphasize it, but with the fund balance,

49:16.010 --> 49:19.142
how important is that to

49:19.196 --> 49:22.834
preserve, especially with the revenue losses

49:22.882 --> 49:25.130
that we've experienced during the Pandemic?

49:25.950 --> 49:29.642
Very. Thank you for bringing that up. Very. Because if you remember,

49:29.776 --> 49:33.386
what we have from ARPA is essentially to replenish the

49:33.408 --> 49:36.490
revenue we lost. So it's not something

49:36.560 --> 49:39.306
that now that we have the money, then this is the money that we spent

49:39.338 --> 49:42.762
today. But those are enough to recover

49:42.826 --> 49:46.554
the revenue losses we have. And again, ARPA is going to be ending

49:46.682 --> 49:50.494
in December 31, 2024. And so that

49:50.532 --> 49:54.386
money is not going to be available. So the hope is that the economy would

49:54.408 --> 49:57.714
be picking up back again at that point. So it is very

49:57.832 --> 50:00.866
important for us to preserve the sun balance at this point. We'll put you back

50:00.888 --> 50:04.866
in queue. Thank you, Council Member Plumber and then Council Member Martin,

50:04.978 --> 50:07.926
thank you so much for all the work that everyone has done. I know this

50:07.948 --> 50:11.414
is tough. So, a couple

50:11.452 --> 50:15.334
of questions. I know we talked about the impact

50:15.382 --> 50:20.042
of the cap, the revenue cap. Is that money completely

50:20.176 --> 50:23.786
gone or is that money injected to the

50:23.808 --> 50:27.946
city in other ways, through management districts, to other avenues,

50:27.978 --> 50:30.000
or is that just not it's not.

50:32.210 --> 50:36.206
So remember when

50:36.228 --> 50:39.346
we hit the revenue, the property tax revenue cap back in

50:39.368 --> 50:43.394
fiscal year 15, we actually have to set our

50:43.432 --> 50:47.534
general fund budget at the cap, which translate

50:47.662 --> 50:50.970
when you actually go through the truth and taxations and voting

50:50.990 --> 50:54.518
for the tax rate to meet that revenue cap,

50:54.684 --> 50:58.386
we would have to adjust our tax rates. So it's

50:58.418 --> 51:02.474
lost because essentially we have to reduce the tax rate to be at

51:02.512 --> 51:06.474
the revenue cap. Okay, and then

51:06.512 --> 51:11.322
the other two more questions. I really

51:11.376 --> 51:14.954
appreciate how you listed in more detail what we did in terms

51:14.992 --> 51:18.698
of implementing the PFM report. Do you have an idea

51:18.784 --> 51:21.246
and I know this is totally an approximation, and maybe you don't even know,

51:21.268 --> 51:24.560
but do you have an idea what that number collectively would look like

51:26.850 --> 51:29.546
dollar wise? Dollar wise? No, we don't.

51:29.738 --> 51:33.380
Because it has to ask for individual calculations with the

51:33.750 --> 51:36.466
no, we don't. I'm just curious to see we spent so much money on that

51:36.488 --> 51:40.162
report. I would just be curious to see what savings, how we

51:40.216 --> 51:43.574
benefited from making those adjustments. Well, you could see

51:43.612 --> 51:46.502
already with the pension reform yeah, no,

51:46.636 --> 51:49.974
we have that. With the OPEC reform, you get the impact on what

51:50.012 --> 51:53.238
the potential reductions in unfunded liabilities

51:53.334 --> 51:56.678
in there. Health benefits. I think that would reduce

51:56.774 --> 52:00.220
our health benefits and I think that was presented earlier as well.

52:01.790 --> 52:05.770
That would reduce our cost this year because of the health benefits.

52:05.920 --> 52:08.318
I definitely see the benefit. I just would love to know what the number was

52:08.404 --> 52:11.680
collectively. Okay, we'll put you back in queue. Okay,

52:12.050 --> 52:15.086
so I'm going to go to slide 29.

52:15.268 --> 52:18.782
Okay, what's next,

52:18.836 --> 52:22.070
addressing the gap? The reason why I'm bringing this up is three of us sitting

52:22.090 --> 52:25.538
around here are leaving. This is our second to last budget, and you're going to

52:25.544 --> 52:28.866
be in charge of the next couple of budgets. And while we have

52:28.888 --> 52:32.642
a really good picture this year, we have an abysmal picture after

52:32.696 --> 52:36.034
we leave. And I'm going to point that out short term,

52:36.082 --> 52:39.526
building up fund balance. Yeah, we're going to continue to do that.

52:39.548 --> 52:44.178
You do that by all these initiatives hiring control, creating efficiencies,

52:44.354 --> 52:48.422
cost cutting opportunity. That means increasing revenue sources.

52:48.486 --> 52:52.054
That's taxes and fees, continuing one day to build fund balance.

52:52.102 --> 52:55.726
So the really number one thing is build fund balance. How do you do that?

52:55.908 --> 53:00.960
So I'm going to go to page 26,

53:02.450 --> 53:06.218
and there was a question that was asked of me last week to prepare

53:06.234 --> 53:10.542
for this. And the person said, dave, how much of our retirement

53:10.606 --> 53:14.446
pay, our defined benefit pay that we pay employees, is included

53:14.478 --> 53:18.242
in OPEB other post employment benefits? Does anybody

53:18.296 --> 53:19.620
know the answer to that?

53:21.610 --> 53:24.774
Zero. OPEB has nothing to

53:24.812 --> 53:28.134
do with retirement pay. It has everything to do mainly with health

53:28.172 --> 53:31.810
care, disability and things of that nature. And the vernacular

53:31.890 --> 53:34.950
and the the verbiage around here is always around OPEB.

53:35.110 --> 53:39.338
OPEB has nothing to do with our big bugaboo, that's retirement pay.

53:39.504 --> 53:43.386
And if you look at slide 26, correct me if

53:43.408 --> 53:46.990
I'm wrong, the retirement pay that we're going to pay this year

53:47.060 --> 53:50.814
in this budget is $436,000,000. Is that

53:50.852 --> 53:51.440
correct,

53:54.850 --> 53:58.686
yes or no? No. The 436 is the debt

53:58.718 --> 54:02.654
payment. Where is the retirement

54:02.702 --> 54:07.474
pay that we're obligated to pay for retirees in fiscal year 2023?

54:07.672 --> 54:11.122
Because I looked through this big book and all I can find is

54:11.256 --> 54:14.406
debt and pay as you go. Is it in here?

54:14.508 --> 54:17.766
It should be in the health benefits, yeah. Okay.

54:17.948 --> 54:21.014
I'm looking for a number because I looked through it and I couldn't find it.

54:21.052 --> 54:25.450
So it's a big number. It's a big number. I think it's

54:26.510 --> 54:30.282
not as big as police, not as big as fire. That's one and two.

54:30.336 --> 54:33.882
But I think it's the third largest expenditure that we will have to pay.

54:34.016 --> 54:36.720
Correct me if I'm wrong. Out of the general fund,

54:38.530 --> 54:42.286
we do have this breakdown on the retirees classified in

54:42.308 --> 54:46.126
civilians, so we can provide it to you. What is

54:46.148 --> 54:50.206
the number? I want a number to everyone to hear because it's

54:50.238 --> 54:53.540
a big number that we never talk about. Oh, yeah,

54:54.710 --> 54:58.514
it's all there. I know all I have in here is the general fund,

54:58.552 --> 55:02.374
but of course, you're looking at the citywide expenditures. Okay. It's a big

55:02.412 --> 55:06.166
number, right? The general fund is at least 60. And then

55:06.188 --> 55:09.714
when we go to slide 21, we talk about pension

55:09.762 --> 55:13.658
reform. Well, my opinion a

55:13.664 --> 55:16.838
lot of that is working fantastic,

55:16.934 --> 55:20.486
especially rate of return because we always guaranteed

55:20.518 --> 55:23.978
a rate of return. In the last couple of years,

55:24.064 --> 55:28.060
a monkey could have received got you a high rate of return.

55:28.430 --> 55:32.126
Anyone could have done that. In this fiscal year, I think

55:32.148 --> 55:35.246
it's going to be a negative rate of return. So the corridor is

55:35.268 --> 55:39.006
going to have to be looked at because that corridor is going to kick

55:39.038 --> 55:43.022
in, which is a softening, a blending of a five year analysis.

55:43.086 --> 55:46.894
Correct. So I think while your projections

55:46.942 --> 55:50.446
I disagree with two of your projections. Number one, sales tax revenue

55:50.478 --> 55:54.102
at zero. I went to the grocery store last night because I have family

55:54.156 --> 55:57.606
coming in this weekend, and I didn't buy any meat or any chicken or any

55:57.628 --> 56:00.594
pork or anything. I bought household items,

56:00.642 --> 56:04.706
toilet paper, things of that nature. It was $462. And it's

56:04.738 --> 56:08.282
my wife and I, so I don't go to the grocery store that often.

56:08.336 --> 56:11.834
But sales tax are going to be a component of that. I think

56:11.872 --> 56:15.674
sales tax revenue is going to continue as we've seen, continue to

56:15.712 --> 56:19.470
increase. And to classify it as zero, I think

56:19.620 --> 56:23.534
isn't going to be accurate. The second part is, I think,

56:23.572 --> 56:26.974
the liability on the pension side, while we've done a good job of moving

56:27.012 --> 56:30.730
it from 8.2 to 1.5, I think we're going

56:30.740 --> 56:33.634
to have a little bit of a kick up because of guaranteed rate of the

56:33.672 --> 56:37.362
return, softening the market, the interest rates that we're seeing,

56:37.496 --> 56:41.880
et cetera. So my ultimate question is that

56:42.330 --> 56:46.166
how do we looking at your slot of long term things to

56:46.188 --> 56:50.130
do? It has a big category up there of the PFM

56:50.210 --> 56:53.686
recommendations. So there's

56:53.718 --> 56:57.194
only one thing you can do, one thing only,

56:57.312 --> 57:00.966
and to move employees from defined contribution

57:01.078 --> 57:04.860
benefit to defined contribution, that's it

57:05.790 --> 57:09.134
hard thing to do. We made an obligation to our

57:09.172 --> 57:12.394
employees, dave Martin's opinion, and we live up to that obligation.

57:12.442 --> 57:16.094
So if you started work yesterday, you're going to receive a divine benefit plan.

57:16.212 --> 57:20.030
But somewhere down the road you got to begin a defined contribution

57:20.110 --> 57:24.402
plan to get rid of this $463,000,000

57:24.536 --> 57:27.938
of growing liability that comes out of the general fund

57:28.024 --> 57:31.480
year in and year out. Until you do that,

57:32.170 --> 57:35.714
we will never pass a structurally balanced budget.

57:35.842 --> 57:39.446
The mayor used the term yesterday. Well, it's pretty close to

57:39.468 --> 57:42.682
being structurally balanced, and it's a hard thing to do.

57:42.816 --> 57:46.294
It's in government because of the defined benefit

57:46.342 --> 57:49.818
plan that we have. So unless you attack that

57:49.984 --> 57:53.894
and when I leave, I want to leave this financial

57:53.942 --> 57:57.038
position of the city better than I came in with.

57:57.124 --> 58:00.938
And I would invite a discussion

58:01.034 --> 58:04.334
on the movement of new employees, let's say

58:04.372 --> 58:07.214
January 1, 2023,

58:07.412 --> 58:10.718
for them to move to a different benefit plan like we've

58:10.734 --> 58:14.926
done. I think in four different instances. We have four different retirement plans.

58:15.038 --> 58:18.606
A fifth one out there has to be defined contribution,

58:18.798 --> 58:23.190
because if you don't do that, you will continue to build your liability

58:24.410 --> 58:28.120
year after year after year, and you will never,

58:28.490 --> 58:32.314
ever get out of it. Do you disagree or

58:32.352 --> 58:33.770
agree with those statements?

58:36.430 --> 58:39.974
That is one of the way to reduce is, yes, defined contributions.

58:40.022 --> 58:43.386
But I know there's a lot of factors to

58:43.408 --> 58:46.666
play in. And again, you are the decisions maker.

58:46.858 --> 58:50.670
But yes, it's one of the way. Yeah, I mean,

58:50.820 --> 58:54.254
it's a tough discussion to have because people say,

58:54.292 --> 58:57.902
well, pay is different. And I think we've done an okay job of

58:58.036 --> 59:01.220
pay. Okay job. That's my opinion. I looked at it

59:02.150 --> 59:06.114
as it compares to corporate. We're losing a lot of good people to

59:06.232 --> 59:10.098
corporate. So we probably have to do something to the general

59:10.184 --> 59:12.290
pay of employees.

59:13.430 --> 59:16.086
I know I haven't heard of the ding. I'm probably talking too long, but when

59:16.108 --> 59:19.766
I talk to young college graduates let

59:19.788 --> 59:23.494
me finish this. When I talk to young college graduates and ask them,

59:23.532 --> 59:27.366
when you go to work, what are you looking for? They never once mentioned I'm

59:27.398 --> 59:31.382
looking for in 40 years what my defined

59:31.526 --> 59:35.038
contribution benefit plan is going to look like. They want pay,

59:35.124 --> 59:38.526
they want family time, which we help, which we did with

59:38.548 --> 59:41.306
the parental leave. They want vacation.

59:41.498 --> 59:45.546
They want really cost of really ease

59:45.578 --> 59:49.570
of living and things that make their life, family life, balance a lot better.

59:49.720 --> 59:53.006
I'll come back to summarize that. I'll go now to council Member

59:53.038 --> 59:54.130
Abby Cayman.

59:57.430 --> 1:00:00.822
Thank you. I'm going to

1:00:00.876 --> 1:00:05.046
divert away from this current topic, but I

1:00:05.068 --> 1:00:09.350
did want to ask one thing. As we're mentioning retirement,

1:00:10.570 --> 1:00:13.558
assisting those who may need assistance, things of that nature,

1:00:13.654 --> 1:00:17.526
how much are our seniors and disabled homeowners

1:00:17.638 --> 1:00:21.686
getting with the proposed increase in the homestead exemption

1:00:21.718 --> 1:00:23.580
or how much are they going to be saving?

1:00:24.590 --> 1:00:28.058
So we run some calculations on that. Again, this is going

1:00:28.064 --> 1:00:31.006
to be a proposal that the mayor is going to bring forward separately to the

1:00:31.028 --> 1:00:34.942
council to increase the senior and disabled tax

1:00:34.996 --> 1:00:38.018
exemptions from 160,000 to 260,000.

1:00:38.184 --> 1:00:42.286
So we look at an average homes

1:00:42.318 --> 1:00:45.794
of 300,000, for example. When we look at that.

1:00:45.832 --> 1:00:49.250
Now, keep in mind, there is also a standard

1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:52.486
homestead exemption, which is 20% of the values, right?

1:00:52.508 --> 1:00:55.640
So when you look at the average home of 300,000,

1:00:56.090 --> 1:01:00.838
you're looking at about saving. This is approximate about $440

1:01:00.924 --> 1:01:05.290
per annual, about $440

1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:06.540
that they can save.

1:01:10.030 --> 1:01:13.946
And again, this is based on our current tax rate. Thank you.

1:01:14.048 --> 1:01:14.860
Thank you.

1:01:17.310 --> 1:01:19.370
Council member. Leticia plumber.

1:01:21.650 --> 1:01:23.870
Council Member Sally Alcorn.

1:01:26.210 --> 1:01:29.534
Thank you. And just to piggyback a little bit on the mayor protem, I do

1:01:29.572 --> 1:01:32.686
appreciate and we had a discussion in one of the budget meetings about your bringing

1:01:32.718 --> 1:01:35.570
forth some recommendations. Short term and long term,

1:01:36.230 --> 1:01:40.342
they're pretty broad, and we're going to have to be more specific about

1:01:40.396 --> 1:01:44.006
them. We're a

1:01:44.028 --> 1:01:47.398
people business. And I think we have made some strides in health benefits.

1:01:47.484 --> 1:01:50.710
Even the $75 surcharge for spouses,

1:01:51.450 --> 1:01:54.680
that made an impact. People left and went to

1:01:56.830 --> 1:02:00.106
a spouse, went to their own insurance. I think that made it being a

1:02:00.128 --> 1:02:03.914
people business. You can't get at the structural imbalances without things

1:02:03.952 --> 1:02:06.890
like pension and health benefits and things and things,

1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:10.506
salaries that impact people. So they are tough discussions,

1:02:10.538 --> 1:02:13.758
Mayor Protem, but you're right on the money. I mean, those are the kinds of

1:02:13.764 --> 1:02:16.960
things that will bring us into structural balance. One point,

1:02:17.590 --> 1:02:21.694
and I forgot to mention council member David Robinson, council Member Carolyn Evans

1:02:21.742 --> 1:02:25.794
Chabaz and Council Member Robert Gallegos has

1:02:25.832 --> 1:02:29.526
joined us a long time ago. Got you

1:02:29.548 --> 1:02:33.734
twice, so you deserve to be gotten twice. So there

1:02:33.772 --> 1:02:37.560
are no other comments or questions from council members.

1:02:39.770 --> 1:02:42.630
You just popped in. Tiffany d thomas.

1:02:43.310 --> 1:02:47.290
Sorry, quick question. This is for Mr. Will. Can you go back and clarify

1:02:47.710 --> 1:02:51.594
the transition for the It? You talked about a

1:02:51.632 --> 1:02:55.286
process, phase two, and then the system implementation.

1:02:55.398 --> 1:02:58.480
Can you give the timeline for that? Again, I didn't catch that.

1:02:59.730 --> 1:03:03.466
Let me go back. So the process is what we're

1:03:03.498 --> 1:03:07.374
working on now. So what I'm waiting for is to map out

1:03:07.412 --> 1:03:11.486
how long is it going to take to change the process, and then I can

1:03:11.508 --> 1:03:14.258
find out how long it's going to take for us to get a system in

1:03:14.264 --> 1:03:17.714
place. So I don't know the timeline exactly for the system, but I will

1:03:17.752 --> 1:03:20.840
know probably by next month or so. Yes, sir.

1:03:25.690 --> 1:03:28.998
Is that it, TIFF? Yes,

1:03:29.164 --> 1:03:32.790
thank you. So my last comments,

1:03:33.290 --> 1:03:36.694
I think it's something we need to study. Is it something we need to implement

1:03:36.742 --> 1:03:40.426
on a certain time frame? That's for council to decide and to

1:03:40.448 --> 1:03:44.026
debate. But I think it's something that we really need to look at. And can

1:03:44.048 --> 1:03:47.246
you do a hodgepodge of different plans? What are the options that are

1:03:47.268 --> 1:03:50.526
available to reduce the long term liability? Because we

1:03:50.548 --> 1:03:53.978
have balanced this budget by a number of measures. Thank God for ARPA

1:03:53.994 --> 1:03:57.358
funds, previous land sales, and divestitures of property.

1:03:57.444 --> 1:04:01.122
That's how we've always balanced the budget to a certain

1:04:01.176 --> 1:04:05.166
degree. So one of the things that the mayor said yesterday in his press conference,

1:04:05.198 --> 1:04:08.626
which is totally accurate, when the credit agencies look at

1:04:08.648 --> 1:04:13.106
us, moody's, Standard and Poors, Fitch, even Dun and Brad Street,

1:04:13.298 --> 1:04:17.142
they look at the viability, long term viability of the city,

1:04:17.276 --> 1:04:21.222
and they say, well, as he said yesterday, you're restricted by

1:04:21.276 --> 1:04:25.258
three things. Revenue cap. Well, that's not going away unless the state

1:04:25.344 --> 1:04:28.714
changes pension reform, moving from

1:04:28.752 --> 1:04:32.886
8.2 billion of liability to 1.5 billion

1:04:33.078 --> 1:04:37.066
a plus. Excellent idea. Excellent concept.

1:04:37.098 --> 1:04:40.186
That works. OPEB liability,

1:04:40.298 --> 1:04:44.238
OPEB trust fund or creation? As Council Member Alcorn mentioned,

1:04:44.324 --> 1:04:48.514
we've done a few things on the health benefit side for retirees to

1:04:48.552 --> 1:04:51.860
make that more fiscally prudent for the city.

1:04:52.550 --> 1:04:56.382
The next iteration of that is how do you handle the lingering

1:04:56.446 --> 1:05:00.114
defined benefit payment that some

1:05:00.152 --> 1:05:03.558
folks are retiring in their drawn retirement pay in

1:05:03.564 --> 1:05:07.270
their we've done a really good job of

1:05:07.420 --> 1:05:10.822
looking at drop and doing something with that. But I would

1:05:10.876 --> 1:05:14.586
recommend that this body study that and

1:05:14.608 --> 1:05:17.866
really look hard at maybe coming up with some

1:05:17.888 --> 1:05:21.654
type of a plan not for existing employees,

1:05:21.702 --> 1:05:25.594
but for employees that aren't in this building today. Because I

1:05:25.632 --> 1:05:29.374
believe when you make a commitment to employees, you live up to it.

1:05:29.572 --> 1:05:33.214
And if you have that on the paper today, you should be

1:05:33.252 --> 1:05:37.226
responsible for that till the day that that person leaves and retires

1:05:37.258 --> 1:05:40.514
and does other things. But I still am convinced that the long

1:05:40.552 --> 1:05:44.020
term fiscally prudent thing, according to our

1:05:44.470 --> 1:05:48.402
consultants that we engaged a couple of years ago, was looking at that.

1:05:48.536 --> 1:05:51.622
We do have five public

1:05:51.676 --> 1:05:55.142
speakers for the five year forecast. We'll start off

1:05:55.196 --> 1:05:57.970
with Ms. Sarah Blanding.

1:05:58.130 --> 1:06:01.874
Saba blanding star

1:06:01.932 --> 1:06:05.082
six to unmute Ms. Blanding. Welcome again.

1:06:05.136 --> 1:06:09.020
You're an active participator in these. Thank you.

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:19.824
Saba Blanding. Star six to unmute.

1:06:19.872 --> 1:06:23.750
Mute. And if not, we will come back to you.

1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:27.430
We can see you, but we can't hear you. Star six,

1:06:33.340 --> 1:06:34.650
we have you now.

1:06:41.430 --> 1:06:42.820
Star six again,

1:06:48.410 --> 1:06:52.230
speak. I'm unmuted. Can you hear me okay?

1:06:52.300 --> 1:06:55.958
Yes. Okay. Wonderful. Apologies for

1:06:55.964 --> 1:06:59.066
that delay. I had a few questions for you all.

1:06:59.248 --> 1:07:03.286
The first is what is the impact of the various collective

1:07:03.318 --> 1:07:07.146
bargaining agreements on this forecast? I'd love to hear you all

1:07:07.168 --> 1:07:10.470
discuss if you have some time today and kind

1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:14.190
of along with that, what information do you have about the potential

1:07:14.610 --> 1:07:17.886
financial impact of pay parity for firefighters if that

1:07:17.908 --> 1:07:21.886
ends up having to be implemented? I noticed there was a 6% increase

1:07:21.918 --> 1:07:25.906
for firefighters, but I wasn't 100% sure how that

1:07:25.928 --> 1:07:27.330
would impact the budget.

1:07:29.830 --> 1:07:34.038
And yeah, I guess I'll throw in one more question

1:07:34.204 --> 1:07:38.098
if I have time. Many council

1:07:38.114 --> 1:07:41.878
members in the mayor have mentioned increasing the size of HPD is a

1:07:41.884 --> 1:07:45.046
priority. There's five additional cadet classes that are

1:07:45.068 --> 1:07:48.534
proposed. What are the long term budget implications

1:07:48.582 --> 1:07:53.398
of increasing the classified headcount for HPD, especially considering

1:07:53.574 --> 1:07:56.966
the passage of House Bill 1900 last summer?

1:07:57.158 --> 1:08:00.686
So I'll leave the rest of my time to hear back

1:08:00.708 --> 1:08:03.040
from you all. Appreciate it.

1:08:04.050 --> 1:08:07.326
Write those down. First question was collective bargaining process. I got

1:08:07.348 --> 1:08:11.022
the first. How was it working? So, on slide 18, we do show

1:08:11.076 --> 1:08:15.602
the employee compensation impact in the budget, which is about 44.6

1:08:15.656 --> 1:08:19.090
million, and that includes all three

1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:22.494
employee groups. But it also factors in attrition

1:08:22.542 --> 1:08:26.742
and things like that. So it's about 44.6

1:08:26.796 --> 1:08:30.786
million in this budget. But that is for Aldo. That's municipal

1:08:30.818 --> 1:08:34.758
policing fires. So if

1:08:34.764 --> 1:08:37.820
you ask for a 6% fire specific,

1:08:39.230 --> 1:08:42.506
I don't have it on the slides, but I can get back to you

1:08:42.528 --> 1:08:46.230
on that and we will post all the answers to SharePoint.

1:08:46.390 --> 1:08:48.460
Correct, correct.

1:08:51.150 --> 1:08:54.730
Posting the SharePoint. The other question was police

1:08:54.810 --> 1:08:58.750
cadets related to budget? If I read the numbers right,

1:08:58.820 --> 1:09:02.458
I. Think the number of FTEs, the headcount in Houston Police

1:09:02.474 --> 1:09:06.770
Department decreased from by 4%

1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:10.674
last year. Fiscal year 22 includes six

1:09:10.712 --> 1:09:14.274
cadet classes, and then in this fiscal year, it includes

1:09:14.322 --> 1:09:18.930
five cadet classes. Overall number of police department employees

1:09:19.010 --> 1:09:22.774
decreased by 4% last fiscal year to

1:09:22.812 --> 1:09:25.030
this fiscal year, according to your projection.

1:09:25.930 --> 1:09:29.686
Go ahead. I was going to say just retirement on our question,

1:09:29.868 --> 1:09:33.618
it's not five additional classes, it's five if

1:09:33.644 --> 1:09:38.166
six was in the base. So we actually reduced to five. So it's

1:09:38.198 --> 1:09:41.486
not a growth in classes. So in terms of the

1:09:41.508 --> 1:09:45.146
budget for that cost, it actually was a little lower for the cadet

1:09:45.178 --> 1:09:48.430
classes. For police going into 23. They're not additional.

1:09:48.850 --> 1:09:52.754
And according to Chief Finner, it was five

1:09:52.792 --> 1:09:56.850
classes at like 55 cadets. It's going to be five classes at

1:09:56.920 --> 1:10:00.926
70 plus cadets. So we'll have what's,

1:10:00.958 --> 1:10:04.680
equivalent to a six class built into the five class process?

1:10:05.050 --> 1:10:08.360
Correct. Okay, next speaker, Mr.

1:10:09.530 --> 1:10:12.550
Jason Oliver. Star six,

1:10:12.620 --> 1:10:13.240
please.

1:10:17.150 --> 1:10:18.780
Good afternoon, everyone.

1:10:20.190 --> 1:10:23.754
So I want to follow up because I heard Saba ask about

1:10:23.792 --> 1:10:27.626
the impact of pay parity and what might be the potential impact of

1:10:27.648 --> 1:10:31.966
that, not the specific raise, the six six six that

1:10:31.988 --> 1:10:34.480
was implemented. So I want to follow up on that.

1:10:36.290 --> 1:10:37.920
Do you all have that information?

1:10:41.730 --> 1:10:44.914
Go ahead. I was going to say, so that would have to be a new

1:10:44.952 --> 1:10:46.820
analysis. When we looked way back,

1:10:47.350 --> 1:10:50.738
2018 or 19, we were looking at

1:10:50.744 --> 1:10:54.326
the pay parity analysis. So much has changed since then.

1:10:54.428 --> 1:10:57.958
So, no, we don't have that number right now.

1:10:58.044 --> 1:11:01.394
Yeah. This budget presentation is purely

1:11:01.442 --> 1:11:05.122
focused on what is in the fiscal year 23 operating

1:11:05.186 --> 1:11:08.966
budget. In this fiscal year 23 budget, we include

1:11:08.998 --> 1:11:11.930
a 6% pay raises for the firefighters.

1:11:15.230 --> 1:11:18.686
That would significantly, probably change and increase our

1:11:18.708 --> 1:11:22.346
liabilities, though, right? We get much closer

1:11:22.378 --> 1:11:25.680
and probably move beyond the pessimistic. Is that the case?

1:11:27.730 --> 1:11:31.534
I'm sorry, say that again. We'd probably end up

1:11:31.572 --> 1:11:34.734
moving much closer to or perhaps beyond the pessimistic

1:11:34.782 --> 1:11:38.206
if the decision ends up going toward the firefighters.

1:11:38.238 --> 1:11:41.982
Is that the case? So if there is any cases

1:11:42.046 --> 1:11:46.118
and increased expenses that happen during the fiscal year,

1:11:46.284 --> 1:11:49.414
then yes, it will be something that we will have to address at that

1:11:49.452 --> 1:11:52.760
point. Okay.

1:11:53.530 --> 1:11:57.714
And the personnel challenges that you all mentioned for finance,

1:11:57.762 --> 1:12:01.290
right. Like you talked about a high number of Vacancies. That seems to be

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:04.762
an issue across the city's departments. Do you see a need

1:12:04.816 --> 1:12:08.774
for more competitive pay in the city? And if so, is that factored

1:12:08.822 --> 1:12:10.090
into your projections?

1:12:12.430 --> 1:12:15.994
Competitive pay? Yeah. No, I mean, I think it's a combination of things

1:12:16.032 --> 1:12:19.774
that you're seeing across this in the city is what we're seeing throughout the

1:12:19.812 --> 1:12:23.478
United States with the great resignation. So it's a combination

1:12:23.514 --> 1:12:27.042
of things. And I do believe the city is starting

1:12:27.096 --> 1:12:30.226
to move in the right direction with the parental leave to be able

1:12:30.248 --> 1:12:33.186
to retain employees. Of course, pay.

1:12:33.288 --> 1:12:36.566
We're always looking at studying certain positions to see if

1:12:36.588 --> 1:12:40.306
we're paying appropriately. Like I know we put a lot of attention in legal

1:12:40.498 --> 1:12:44.790
for the attorneys because that's where we're losing a lot of attorneys

1:12:45.130 --> 1:12:49.026
because of pay. So we are doing those things. So I'm hoping

1:12:49.138 --> 1:12:52.426
that with these things we're doing we'll start to be able to

1:12:52.448 --> 1:12:55.754
retain more employees. But it's across the nation, not just the city,

1:12:55.792 --> 1:12:59.134
that's facing this problem. And if I could add, keep in mind as well human

1:12:59.172 --> 1:13:02.478
resource departments also conducted those market

1:13:02.564 --> 1:13:06.046
studies right. Which is based on the financial policies every three

1:13:06.068 --> 1:13:09.342
years. Thank you. Okay. And my last

1:13:09.396 --> 1:13:12.626
question to increase the fund balance is a

1:13:12.648 --> 1:13:16.334
reduction in spending on classified officers a viable

1:13:16.382 --> 1:13:19.826
strategy to ensure fiscal sustainability since they're one of

1:13:19.848 --> 1:13:23.502
our largest general fund liabilities. In theory,

1:13:23.566 --> 1:13:26.694
the fund balance will be increased either from the increased revenues or

1:13:26.732 --> 1:13:30.166
reduction in expenditures. It's just based on what we

1:13:30.188 --> 1:13:33.474
dealt with, revenues and expenditures. Any increase in the fund balance,

1:13:33.522 --> 1:13:35.240
it's just a combination of both.

1:13:37.690 --> 1:13:40.534
Okay, thank you. Thank you. And I made a mistake.

1:13:40.582 --> 1:13:43.866
SharePoint is only available to council members and staff, but if

1:13:43.888 --> 1:13:47.546
you have questions and you'd like us to answer them, email us at

1:13:47.568 --> 1:13:51.534
District E at houst gov and we will work

1:13:51.572 --> 1:13:54.238
you to get the questions answered. Once again.

1:13:54.324 --> 1:13:57.630
District e at Houst gov.

1:13:58.130 --> 1:13:59.950
Mr. Arisbrown.

1:14:03.670 --> 1:14:05.220
Star six, please.

1:14:09.510 --> 1:14:12.740
Hi, this is Aris Brown. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1:14:13.910 --> 1:14:17.378
No worries. Hi, I have a couple of questions. One of

1:14:17.384 --> 1:14:21.238
the questions I was thinking about one

1:14:21.244 --> 1:14:24.998
of the sections within the general fund revenue section it

1:14:25.004 --> 1:14:28.674
was focused on increasing the budget by funds from Park

1:14:28.722 --> 1:14:32.422
Houston and that I believe relies on cars and parking

1:14:32.486 --> 1:14:36.154
costs even though Houston has been slowly but surely implementing more

1:14:36.192 --> 1:14:39.626
bike routes and hopefully more reliable public transit. So one

1:14:39.648 --> 1:14:43.258
of my questions was about the priorities of the city in

1:14:43.264 --> 1:14:47.482
the coming years. Is there still going to be a reliance upon a car centric

1:14:47.546 --> 1:14:51.146
city and relying upon the revenues that come from cars? And I'm curious

1:14:51.178 --> 1:14:56.926
about how that aligns with the goals to be bike

1:14:56.958 --> 1:15:00.626
routes and walkability and that sort

1:15:00.648 --> 1:15:03.906
of progressive idea, especially as we see uncertainty in

1:15:03.928 --> 1:15:07.526
the oil industry. So that was one of my questions. Another one

1:15:07.548 --> 1:15:10.550
of my questions was about the outcome based budget.

1:15:11.530 --> 1:15:15.750
We've had conversations about this with past budget

1:15:16.250 --> 1:15:19.690
conversations, workshops, et cetera, in which community

1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:23.766
members have expressed their concerns and wanted to offer ideas

1:15:23.798 --> 1:15:27.386
about how to implement the needs of their

1:15:27.408 --> 1:15:31.386
community. So I'm curious about they're in the basis of implementing

1:15:31.578 --> 1:15:34.798
outcome based budget, factor in community engagement and

1:15:34.804 --> 1:15:37.390
an analysis of ethics and community ethics.

1:15:41.250 --> 1:15:44.306
I did not get the first one but I think

1:15:44.328 --> 1:15:47.682
I follow your second questions on the outcome based

1:15:47.736 --> 1:15:50.260
budgeting to engage the public.

1:15:51.190 --> 1:15:55.446
Right now, the outcome based budgeting is an internal process

1:15:55.548 --> 1:15:59.990
so that we can provide the information relevant

1:16:00.730 --> 1:16:04.306
to the Council for decisions

1:16:04.498 --> 1:16:08.102
which is based on the current programs that is

1:16:08.156 --> 1:16:10.460
in the departments at this point.

1:16:11.710 --> 1:16:15.546
I think that's all I can add. Yeah, I would just add that the

1:16:15.568 --> 1:16:19.174
Plan Houston really is kind of driving from the community engagement.

1:16:19.222 --> 1:16:22.526
So if planning does another update to

1:16:22.548 --> 1:16:26.078
the Plan Houston or all of that will drive some of

1:16:26.084 --> 1:16:28.190
the community involvement.

1:16:30.050 --> 1:16:33.666
Yeah, no, thank you to rephrase. I guess my

1:16:33.688 --> 1:16:38.238
first question, I'm looking at the funding.

1:16:38.414 --> 1:16:42.290
I think there's a little

1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:46.040
footnote that says that the

1:16:46.490 --> 1:16:50.214
increase primarily in transfer from Park Houston Fund

1:16:50.252 --> 1:16:54.134
on page ten, on page

1:16:54.172 --> 1:16:57.486
ten of the fiscal year 2023 general fund revenue,

1:16:57.538 --> 1:17:01.306
including other resources, there's the sub note seven that

1:17:01.328 --> 1:17:05.002
says that there's an increase primarily in transfer from Park East and Fund,

1:17:05.056 --> 1:17:09.126
which means parking. I'm curious about how that aligns

1:17:09.158 --> 1:17:13.310
with being a less car centric city and having more people

1:17:13.380 --> 1:17:18.110
driving, having people more like biking and walking and public transport,

1:17:18.450 --> 1:17:21.754
transit. I'm curious about how those two align and whether or not they do align.

1:17:21.802 --> 1:17:25.214
Is there still a goal to be a less car centric city or

1:17:25.252 --> 1:17:28.706
are we still going to rely for the next couple of years on

1:17:28.808 --> 1:17:32.446
parking costs and those sorts of things, even with the uncertainty

1:17:32.478 --> 1:17:36.186
in the oil industry? I think I follow I know it's a little bit mumbling,

1:17:36.238 --> 1:17:39.446
but I think I follow the jess of your question.

1:17:39.548 --> 1:17:43.442
So you're going back to slide ten where we have an increased

1:17:43.506 --> 1:17:46.678
revenues transfer from the Park Houston Fund.

1:17:46.764 --> 1:17:50.902
Correct. So based on the ordinance

1:17:50.966 --> 1:17:54.586
created for the Park Houston Fund, and that is a

1:17:54.608 --> 1:17:58.902
special fund, so essentially any excess

1:17:58.966 --> 1:18:02.422
fund over, I believe it's 2 million is to be transferred to the general

1:18:02.496 --> 1:18:06.014
fund. So in the last year, the last two years,

1:18:06.052 --> 1:18:09.338
of course with the stay at home and the pandemic,

1:18:09.434 --> 1:18:12.862
there is no such revenues generated in that special fund.

1:18:12.996 --> 1:18:16.026
So now that it start picking up, then that fund has been

1:18:16.068 --> 1:18:19.474
generating revenues. In that sense, the ordinance can be picking up

1:18:19.512 --> 1:18:22.674
back again where any excess of a 2 million will

1:18:22.712 --> 1:18:26.138
be transferred to the general fund. So this is not impacting

1:18:26.254 --> 1:18:29.734
the current operations of the special fund itself. This is just

1:18:29.772 --> 1:18:33.106
a financial that is aligned to the ordinance created

1:18:33.138 --> 1:18:36.246
for that fund. Thank you,

1:18:36.268 --> 1:18:39.670
Ms. Brown. Next speaker is Mr. Christopher Rivera.

1:18:39.830 --> 1:18:42.220
Christopher Rivera, star six.

1:18:45.390 --> 1:18:48.860
Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Go ahead.

1:18:49.230 --> 1:18:52.654
Great. Thank you everyone. I'm just going to give a little

1:18:52.692 --> 1:18:54.000
context for my question.

1:18:56.050 --> 1:18:59.594
This fiscal year, the Housing and Community Department will only receive

1:18:59.642 --> 1:19:02.858
0.1% of what the Houston Police Department is expected

1:19:02.874 --> 1:19:06.626
to receive in funding. Examining the overall budget, the housing department will

1:19:06.648 --> 1:19:10.766
only receive 0.1% from the $2.74 billion

1:19:10.798 --> 1:19:13.662
general budget. As the city cuts funding for housing,

1:19:13.726 --> 1:19:17.038
rent is continuously increasing. Local reports say rent

1:19:17.054 --> 1:19:20.902
has gone up 23% in Houston, but experts say they will not come down.

1:19:21.036 --> 1:19:24.486
The rent increase is only making it harder for Houstonians to stay safe and

1:19:24.508 --> 1:19:27.846
sheltered. Just last week, there was 783

1:19:27.868 --> 1:19:30.906
Evictions filed in Houston, and since March 2020,

1:19:31.008 --> 1:19:33.610
there has been over 85 Evictions filed.

1:19:34.030 --> 1:19:37.834
Houstonians are struggling to keep themselves safe because they are losing the ability to pay

1:19:37.872 --> 1:19:41.914
their homes or apartments. The city needs to reimagine public safety and

1:19:41.952 --> 1:19:44.894
consider housing programs as a solution to public safety issues.

1:19:45.012 --> 1:19:47.934
Now, my question is, in the next five years,

1:19:48.052 --> 1:19:51.882
how will the city of Houston address our growing public safety need for affordable

1:19:51.946 --> 1:19:55.202
permanent housing programs when it continues to deplete public

1:19:55.256 --> 1:19:58.802
safety services like housing only into

1:19:58.936 --> 1:20:02.610
increased services that criminalize communities like the police budget.

1:20:05.610 --> 1:20:08.434
So I know on housing departments,

1:20:08.482 --> 1:20:12.086
the large revenue source they have is through

1:20:12.108 --> 1:20:15.830
the grants. A large of their operations is grant funded.

1:20:16.410 --> 1:20:19.746
I think you mentioned about public safety in that

1:20:19.788 --> 1:20:23.482
area. I understand that police departments do work hand in hand

1:20:23.536 --> 1:20:27.082
with housing departments and any other departments when it comes to public

1:20:27.136 --> 1:20:29.900
safety to support those operations as well.

1:20:30.430 --> 1:20:34.142
You probably will get more details from housing departments when we do have those

1:20:34.196 --> 1:20:37.870
specific budget workshop. But again, this is a general fund

1:20:37.940 --> 1:20:41.294
and they do have a small portions in the general fund because

1:20:41.332 --> 1:20:44.594
they are largely funded out of grants. So here's my

1:20:44.632 --> 1:20:48.318
follow up. How will we become self sustainable?

1:20:48.414 --> 1:20:51.890
And just in case we lose those federal grants,

1:20:53.990 --> 1:20:57.158
it will be something that we have to adjust. And I think that's, like I

1:20:57.164 --> 1:21:00.886
said, it's one of those importance to preserve fund

1:21:00.908 --> 1:21:04.214
balance because those needs will arise. And I think that's why we

1:21:04.252 --> 1:21:07.270
have those set aside,

1:21:07.710 --> 1:21:11.180
fund balance to prepare us going forward.

1:21:13.150 --> 1:21:16.938
Thank you. Mr. Rivera, I think that's an outstanding question.

1:21:17.024 --> 1:21:20.410
We talked about that at council this morning. Affordable housing.

1:21:20.750 --> 1:21:24.174
I'm not sure if there is such a thing as affordable housing. What I'm seeing

1:21:24.212 --> 1:21:27.374
in the marketplace, every time you turn around, interest rates are going

1:21:27.412 --> 1:21:30.878
up and affordable housing costs are going through the roof

1:21:30.964 --> 1:21:34.222
with the cost of material. So you're exactly right.

1:21:34.276 --> 1:21:37.246
That is going to be a challenge for us in this world that we live

1:21:37.268 --> 1:21:40.898
in, is how we define affordable housing, how do we deal with it? And I

1:21:40.904 --> 1:21:44.466
know that the Housing Committee, in the hands of Tiffany Thomas, is doing

1:21:44.488 --> 1:21:47.414
a great job with that and will continue to do a great job with that.

1:21:47.452 --> 1:21:50.646
But that is a tough question to answer for all of

1:21:50.668 --> 1:21:52.200
us. I know it is for me.

1:21:53.690 --> 1:21:57.474
Thank you. Last but not least, mr. Doug Smith.

1:21:57.522 --> 1:21:59.500
Doug, I hope you're feeling better.

1:22:01.390 --> 1:22:04.870
I felt better for days, but I'm still testing negative,

1:22:04.950 --> 1:22:08.650
positive, so that's why I'm not there today. But thank you for asking.

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:11.674
Stay away. Yeah, I will.

1:22:11.792 --> 1:22:14.874
That's what Jessica said too. And then I intend to hopefully

1:22:14.922 --> 1:22:18.686
by next Monday I'll be testing negative. But in

1:22:18.708 --> 1:22:22.522
any case, a couple of questions. First of all, do I understand correctly

1:22:22.586 --> 1:22:25.902
that the first tranche of the ARPA funds

1:22:25.966 --> 1:22:29.394
around $300 million, about half was used last

1:22:29.432 --> 1:22:33.026
year and half was used this year. And you have not taken the

1:22:33.048 --> 1:22:36.726
other 300 million into consideration. When you did

1:22:36.748 --> 1:22:40.278
your proposed what was the proposed budget gap? I think I understood you

1:22:40.284 --> 1:22:44.182
to say that. And then I wanted to address you talked

1:22:44.236 --> 1:22:48.280
about how we continue to

1:22:48.970 --> 1:22:52.602
address the gap and you say continue hiring control.

1:22:52.736 --> 1:22:55.210
And yet when I look at the General Fund budget,

1:22:55.790 --> 1:23:00.010
between 2021 and the projected 2023,

1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:04.522
there's an addition of 766, full time equivalents.

1:23:04.666 --> 1:23:08.026
And in addition to that, obviously there's

1:23:08.058 --> 1:23:11.358
the huge one, huge large increases in pay that you're going

1:23:11.364 --> 1:23:15.662
to have to deal with over the next three years as the previous

1:23:15.726 --> 1:23:19.810
ones, the agreements come in. And finally,

1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:23.780
I think let me check, I think that's it

1:23:24.390 --> 1:23:28.310
on page 76, 26 of your presentation,

1:23:28.810 --> 1:23:33.750
under your projections for the police and the firefighters,

1:23:34.250 --> 1:23:37.906
you have a low for the police of 27, three to 30,

1:23:37.948 --> 1:23:41.818
212, and you project them at nearly the full

1:23:41.904 --> 1:23:45.590
high amount. And for the fire department,

1:23:45.750 --> 1:23:49.254
you project them at the very lowest amount. And I'm curious

1:23:49.382 --> 1:23:52.782
how you decided to differentiate that.

1:23:52.836 --> 1:23:56.714
And then finally, on the outcome based budget,

1:23:56.842 --> 1:24:01.114
on page 33, you have different categories

1:24:01.162 --> 1:24:04.866
that need to be met. Do you have timelines for when you expect to

1:24:04.888 --> 1:24:07.860
have those categories done?

1:24:08.550 --> 1:24:10.020
And that's it.

1:24:15.990 --> 1:24:19.670
I think the first question was related to FTEs. He said

1:24:19.740 --> 1:24:23.206
there's an increase of FTEs of I think it was 700 and

1:24:23.228 --> 1:24:25.654
some odd. Yes,

1:24:25.692 --> 1:24:26.920
766.

1:24:31.150 --> 1:24:34.598
2nd question was a counterpart

1:24:34.614 --> 1:24:38.266
of that with pay, increase in pay, 6% for fire,

1:24:38.448 --> 1:24:40.380
4% for police. Yes,

1:24:41.470 --> 1:24:45.370
municipal. So how do you afford increasing FTEs

1:24:45.450 --> 1:24:49.166
and increasing pay within the confines of the general budget? I think that was

1:24:49.188 --> 1:24:52.894
his question. Yeah, exactly. And as

1:24:52.932 --> 1:24:56.770
it relates to your goal to address the gap, to continue

1:24:56.840 --> 1:25:01.090
hiring control, it makes it very difficult to do that with

1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:04.802
those figures I'm trying to follow. When you say

1:25:04.856 --> 1:25:09.094
increase in FTEs, are you looking at the citywide FTEs from

1:25:09.132 --> 1:25:10.920
a specific fiscal year?

1:25:12.090 --> 1:25:15.910
No, just the general fund. On the General Fund FTEs

1:25:16.890 --> 1:25:20.220
on page twelve. Page twelve,

1:25:23.870 --> 1:25:27.514
slide twelve. I'm looking

1:25:27.552 --> 1:25:32.794
at page twelve. Hang on table

1:25:32.842 --> 1:25:36.174
five at the very bottom, because if I'm looking at

1:25:36.212 --> 1:25:38.880
page seven, which is General Fund specific,

1:25:40.290 --> 1:25:43.634
I'm showing a reduction from fiscal year 22

1:25:43.672 --> 1:25:47.058
to 23, from 13 seven

1:25:47.144 --> 1:25:50.338
to 13 five. I just want to

1:25:50.344 --> 1:25:52.020
make sure we are on the same page.

1:25:55.190 --> 1:25:58.678
Excuse me. It was 2021, was the base year

1:25:58.764 --> 1:26:02.742
between 2021 and projected 2023,

1:26:02.876 --> 1:26:06.086
there's an increase of 766 when

1:26:06.108 --> 1:26:09.526
you add both the regular plus the

1:26:09.548 --> 1:26:12.906
overtime FTEs. Okay, keep in mind in fiscal year, and I think

1:26:12.928 --> 1:26:16.730
we have that in the footnote, fiscal year 20 and fiscal year 21,

1:26:16.800 --> 1:26:20.426
it shows a lower FTEs because of the redeployment that

1:26:20.448 --> 1:26:22.270
are funded out of CRF.

1:26:23.490 --> 1:26:27.710
So that FTEs in 21 and 20 and 2020

1:26:27.860 --> 1:26:31.066
were kind of skewed because of some of those are funded

1:26:31.098 --> 1:26:33.620
out of CRF. And not out of the general fund.

1:26:37.250 --> 1:26:41.134
What is CRF again? Okay, and I think you

1:26:41.172 --> 1:26:44.766
also asked about the assumptions on the fire pension back in

1:26:44.788 --> 1:26:46.640
page 26, correct?

1:26:47.830 --> 1:26:51.410
Yes. Okay, so the reason why on fire

1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:55.860
pension and police pension, we have the low and the high.

1:26:56.230 --> 1:27:00.438
Again, this is on the pension city contributions, which is again

1:27:00.604 --> 1:27:04.374
governed by the pension reform. Right now,

1:27:04.412 --> 1:27:07.574
for the fire pensions, they are below the

1:27:07.612 --> 1:27:11.634
minimum corridor. So when you fall below the minimum corridor,

1:27:11.682 --> 1:27:15.930
the city contributions will be based on the minimum point, not the midpoint.

1:27:17.950 --> 1:27:21.578
Okay. And that's why we put a range, because that can change in the

1:27:21.584 --> 1:27:22.700
next five years.

1:27:26.130 --> 1:27:29.706
Okay. Question. What is CRF? You referred to CRF.

1:27:29.738 --> 1:27:32.522
What is that? CRF.

1:27:32.586 --> 1:27:36.286
CRF. That is the Coronavirus Relief Fund. That is based on the

1:27:36.308 --> 1:27:39.522
Care. Okay. That's the cares act.

1:27:39.576 --> 1:27:42.260
Okay, fine. Correct. And I guess finally,

1:27:42.870 --> 1:27:45.934
do you have time limits or can you assign timelines

1:27:45.982 --> 1:27:50.054
to your outcome based budget? Page 33

1:27:50.172 --> 1:27:53.880
of the various steps that have to take place before this happens.

1:27:55.050 --> 1:27:58.598
So, first step will be the process.

1:27:58.764 --> 1:28:02.562
So I do anticipate by December

1:28:02.626 --> 1:28:05.782
of next year we will have the process in place.

1:28:05.916 --> 1:28:09.386
What I don't know is that the system will be ready by then, but the

1:28:09.408 --> 1:28:12.874
goal is for FY 24 budget, hopefully by December, at least

1:28:12.912 --> 1:28:16.078
we have the outcome based budgeting process in place so that we

1:28:16.084 --> 1:28:19.262
can follow the process. Thanks, Mr.

1:28:19.316 --> 1:28:23.022
Smith. Okay, thank you.

1:28:23.156 --> 1:28:26.750
Before we move on to Houston Fire Department, are there any other questions

1:28:26.820 --> 1:28:30.254
or comments from council members? We have no other

1:28:30.292 --> 1:28:32.880
public speakers that have signed up to speak in person,

1:28:33.810 --> 1:28:37.006
so I will ask again, is there any comments or

1:28:37.028 --> 1:28:40.518
questions from council members before we dismiss the great city of

1:28:40.524 --> 1:28:41.960
Houston finance team?

1:28:44.650 --> 1:28:45.206
Okay,
