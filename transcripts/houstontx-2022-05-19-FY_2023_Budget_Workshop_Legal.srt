1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,850
The delay, but good afternoon. I am Council Member Edward Pollard

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,306
and I serve as Vice Chair of the City of Houston Budget and Fiscal Affairs

3
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:19,066
Committee. I called this meeting to order and would like to welcome Council

4
00:00:19,098 --> 00:00:22,762
Member Abby Cayman, who is in person. All budget

5
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:26,262
workshops will be conducted in person. Only public

6
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:30,214
speakers have the option to comment in person or

7
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:33,474
virtually. Also would like to welcome staff from District

8
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:36,486
B, District F, District H,

9
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:42,714
District I, at large position three, and at large position 448

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,230
hours prior to the start of all workshop presentations,

11
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,786
materials are uploaded to SharePoint and hard copies delivered to

12
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:53,518
each council office. The budget workshop schedule has been posted to

13
00:00:53,524 --> 00:00:57,834
the BFA website. Questions from council members can be uploaded

14
00:00:57,882 --> 00:01:01,918
at any time during the budget workshop process, the earlier the better,

15
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:05,650
allowing the departments plenty of time to provide responses.

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,614
All departments have been directed to provide written responses

17
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:13,102
within 48 hours of the conclusion of their presentation.

18
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:16,790
To any question posted by council members to SharePoint,

19
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,966
all public speakers should be signed in to speak.

20
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,198
If you have not signed up, please sign in now.

21
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,086
At the front table, district E Staff Member Carolina will

22
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:32,186
be monitoring the public speakers list. Council members,

23
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,202
the fiscal year 2023 budget amendment template has

24
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,926
also been uploaded to the SharePoint Budget Workspace.

25
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:43,994
Mayor Turner sent out a memo to all council members and council offices

26
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:47,998
to ensure productive discussions on the fiscal year 2023

27
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:51,690
proposed budget reminder only operational

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,550
budget related amendments will be considered. Policy amendments,

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,266
as in years past, will be ruled out of order. Please see the

30
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,846
Mayor's memo for additional guidance. Amendments are due

31
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:05,380
on Wednesday, May 25.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,834
We also have Council member Sally Alcorn in chambers.

33
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:15,026
In person? This afternoon we will hear from Legal

34
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:17,694
Department, Planning and Development Department,

35
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:21,626
administrative Office of City Council, administrative and

36
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:25,446
Regulatory Affairs Department, as well as the Municipal courts.

37
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:30,246
As a reminder, the only people attending virtually are public speakers.

38
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:34,046
We'll get to their questions after the presentations and questions from

39
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:37,486
council have concluded. At this time, I would like

40
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:41,230
to welcome City Attorney Arturo Michelle and Thy Ruiz to provide

41
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,710
the legal budget presentation.

42
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,630
The floor is yours.

43
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,770
Um, let's begin with

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,566
the second chart. This is the functional.org chart that we

45
00:02:56,588 --> 00:03:00,642
have. This includes the different sections,

46
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:04,726
the overall and the dollars associated with them.

47
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:08,202
And this is from all three of the funds that

48
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:11,558
affect the legal department the General Fund, the Property and Casualty,

49
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:14,790
and the Workers Comp funds. It excludes

50
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,694
any positions funded by enterprise funds.

51
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:22,062
They're part of other department budgets, such as public works

52
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:26,110
and airport. The next slide

53
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,926
and the following one describe what we do some

54
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:36,382
of the major areas. Of course, everyone here at the table is intimately

55
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:40,082
familiar with it. I would like to point out that we

56
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,794
do deal perhaps more than other cities in

57
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:47,000
certain areas, such as planning and development issues.

58
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,966
We don't follow the zoning scheme, the regulatory scheme that

59
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:53,910
many cities do that presents particular challenges.

60
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,750
We often deal with regulatory or

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,842
statutory contract compliance. There are issues where the state challenges

62
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:05,866
us on preemption issue of water rights and so on. So we

63
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:08,938
have more activity than I think many cities do in that area.

64
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:11,898
Also, with our protection of neighborhoods,

65
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:15,370
again not being zoned deed restrictions,

66
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,926
that brings up particular issues that requires a lot

67
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:23,150
of investigation, assessment and analysis challenging

68
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,426
those entities or persons who we believe are violating the

69
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:31,666
law. And then we deal with a huge number of contracts and

70
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,414
the contract issues. And I would like to point out

71
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:38,370
now, although I could do it later, when I talk about some of the accomplishments,

72
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,658
that in contracts, in government contracting,

73
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:46,454
what is valued is transparency and

74
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:50,322
avoiding any fraud or other illegalities

75
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:53,706
that slows the process down. So we work constantly with

76
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:57,558
strategic procurement to try to do our best to improve the processes

77
00:04:57,654 --> 00:05:00,380
and get the departments the contracts that they need.

78
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,066
The next page shows some of what I'm

79
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:09,102
talking about. And also our

80
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:12,282
labor lawyers, in addition to litigation,

81
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:15,682
have in fact their largest volume is probably the

82
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:19,246
adverse matters, the contested case matters that are not litigated before the Civil

83
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,734
Service Commission, issues before Department

84
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:26,310
of labor or EEOC, things of that nature.

85
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,850
In the following slide, it reflects

86
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,362
in part some of our priorities of the financial or societal impact

87
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:39,298
of service delivery. Our complete communities initiatives of

88
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:43,130
the city is one where we provide support

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,746
services. We try to do what we can to accelerate the process,

90
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:50,686
whether it's a transactional or whether it's an assessment and analysis of what can

91
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:55,326
be done. And then we anticipate growth in areas that

92
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:57,840
have been growing for a number of years now.

93
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,094
Public works with our aging infrastructure system and

94
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:05,794
our utility system, the airport system always has

95
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:10,180
new and pretty significant issues.

96
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,334
Housing is going to continue to be an issue here in Houston

97
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:18,630
and in most places in Texas for quite a while. The police department

98
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,966
with the onesafe Houston is

99
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:26,882
something that we have spent a big focus on, not only an ordinance,

100
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:30,858
but I would like to point out the Office of

101
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:35,050
Policing Accountability has been

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,242
housed in our OIG department. It really takes the lead,

103
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:42,586
crystal Lakora for in many of these initiatives, in explaining

104
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:46,526
what's happening in the community, in taking complaints, in putting out

105
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:50,074
as much information as we can so the public understands what the city of Houston

106
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:53,842
is doing. The next

107
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:57,298
slide gets we start getting into the numbers here.

108
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:01,294
It's the following slide the revenue

109
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:05,202
by funds and this is money

110
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:08,566
that comes in. So I'll get to the expenditures next. But this is the

111
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:13,106
revenue by funds and as you can see that there's

112
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:16,470
an increase in both the general fund and property and casualty.

113
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,198
Property and casualty fund revenue is just increased

114
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:23,450
to reflect the increased expenditures.

115
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,194
The general fund increase is due primarily to

116
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:31,134
vacancies. We've had an issue in being able to staff our

117
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:35,118
department. I think that's generally true of many

118
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:38,794
local government, public sector legal

119
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:42,382
departments. But here it has become

120
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:45,890
a big issue that I think we've been able to solve by having

121
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,686
market adjustments to increase.

122
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:52,370
I think the mayor worked with us and he did,

123
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,874
I thought, a remarkable job of being able to fund market increases.

124
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:59,922
So we are no longer at the bottom of the major cities in Texas

125
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:03,346
and then other major local government units

126
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:05,190
such as Metro, Harris County.

127
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,002
And the following slide reflects just what I was saying.

128
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:14,694
Right now, the revenue highlights.

129
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:18,666
The General Fund shows the vacancies of savings there

130
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:22,286
and then the property and casualty revenues to match the expenditures in the

131
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:25,694
funds. Now, the following slide gets

132
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:29,360
into expenditure by funds and

133
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,660
we go to the three major funds that I've discussed before.

134
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,690
As you can see, there's a bigger bump in

135
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,438
the Workers Comp Fund, but that's a smaller one. And so it's

136
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:46,626
probably better to explain that and these others in the following slides where

137
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:49,814
we can get into the details. But you can see here that the General Fund

138
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:53,750
has an increase of about 17% and about 6%

139
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,534
for the property and Casualty fund. So the following

140
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:01,274
slide, if you look at this,

141
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:04,780
you'll see the two dark bars toward the top.

142
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,402
What's in under that first bar is really the net

143
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:12,670
change to FY 2022.

144
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,680
And then below the second bar is the FY 2023

145
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,760
expenditure. So what you can see here is

146
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,242
we have an operating budget to begin with. Then you

147
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:28,450
add in the Hope adjustment,

148
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,910
then you have additional staff and pay adjustments.

149
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,850
So that is part of what I was talking about before with the increase.

150
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,114
And then below that you have restricted accounts. And restricted

151
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:44,760
accounts are it Application Data services.

152
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,180
The law has increasingly become dependent on technology

153
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,586
in order to be able to do the job that you need to do to

154
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,380
provide quality legal work.

155
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,842
Going below the second bar, if you look at the FY

156
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:05,258
2023, you can see there a reflection

157
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:07,440
of some of the remarks I've made to date.

158
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,442
The program adjustments are in the department market

159
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:15,694
salary increase, the additional staff

160
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:19,742
and pay adjustments, and then the parenthetical,

161
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:23,570
the 216. The negative just reflects a personnel transfer

162
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,918
from one fund to another. Then there are

163
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:30,760
contractual or mandated adjustments. That includes Hope,

164
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,334
again, restricted accounts and then health benefits make

165
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:37,560
up that last number, 44.

166
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,994
And so if you look at the difference between the two

167
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:45,740
budgets, that yields a 17% change.

168
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,230
This was set up to set questions for last. But if you have questions

169
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,878
at any point, please ask me. I don't want to overlook a slide where

170
00:10:57,044 --> 00:11:00,986
it may be confusing to you. The following

171
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:04,590
slide slide ten. This is the highlights.

172
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,922
It's an important aspect of the increase is the market

173
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:11,426
salary increase to bring us up to competitive with

174
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:14,866
the other entities to

175
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:18,646
which we were losing attorneys, frankly, in addition to

176
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:22,226
the private sector. And then the funding that is required

177
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:25,062
to be made for health benefits, for hope and so on.

178
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:28,954
And then the funding for our outside counsel, litigation support,

179
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:30,730
claims and judgments.

180
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,514
The following slide number eleven is

181
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:42,554
this. Now I begin a series of charts to show where

182
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:45,902
the money is going within a fund. So this is the general fund.

183
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:49,246
If you look at the left, you'll see that

184
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:53,840
personnel makes up 92% of the costs. And that's very typical for any

185
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,874
legal department, law firm anywhere. That's generally where

186
00:11:57,912 --> 00:12:00,994
you have a huge bulk of your cost. Non personnel is

187
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:04,626
8%. The pie chart to the right, where the arrow is

188
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:08,374
pointing, breaks down the non personnel. So you have the

189
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:11,862
restricted accounts that make up about half. And those

190
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,686
restricted accounts are the It applications, data Services,

191
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:18,470
voice Services, insurance Fees,

192
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,998
GIS, HR, client Services, things of that nature.

193
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:26,394
Then you have other services that make up 18%. And this

194
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:29,318
is Annex. Parking software, maintenance,

195
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:32,250
mail services, code of ordinance printing,

196
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,074
CLE bar dues. Travel supplies

197
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:41,520
are office and computer supplies. That's another 12%.

198
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,270
General Office Services. Those are in the nature of Westlaw

199
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,678
title data. And then paying the Harris

200
00:12:49,694 --> 00:12:52,786
County Department of Ed for archived services, and then

201
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:56,618
the legal services. The 9% is outside counsel

202
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,562
that we use for immigration visas, artificial intelligence,

203
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:04,214
things of that nature. And then supplies are your standard

204
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:06,230
office and computer supplies.

205
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,616
The next slide, twelve shows the

206
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:17,104
property and casualty fund. And there

207
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:20,450
you see the numbers are reversed because

208
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,748
this is from which we pay our claims. So personnel makes up

209
00:13:24,774 --> 00:13:28,900
only 35%, whereas non personnel makes up 65%.

210
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,772
And then looking at the pie chart to the right, you can see that

211
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:36,440
the bulk of the expenditures there

212
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,440
are anticipated for claims, settlements, judgments, attorneys fees,

213
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,840
legal services are outside counsel fees,

214
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,144
litigation support. Those are expert witnesses,

215
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:52,696
court reporters, medical services, document reading,

216
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:56,350
things of that nature. Then we have supplies and

217
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,396
restricted accounts, and then other services which were the

218
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:04,480
professional and membership fees, west law, travel, things of that nature.

219
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,200
Then the next slide shows the workers comp.

220
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,082
And as you can see, personnel makes up the bulk of that, about three,

221
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:21,466
four, and then non personnel is

222
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:25,002
about a fourth. And if you look at to the right,

223
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:28,366
you'll see that the restricted accounts, again, the It Application

224
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:32,634
Data Services, et cetera, make up the bulk of that supplies,

225
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:36,510
a small amount. And then the other services, the parking, the software,

226
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,614
and so on. So that's how the workers fund compensation

227
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:45,586
fund breaks down. So at this point,

228
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:49,602
I'm opening up to questions, and all I really have left after that

229
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,934
is just a glossary, our chart, and then

230
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:56,322
some demographic data and the department

231
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:59,446
accomplishments. Thank you,

232
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:03,094
Arturo, for your presentation. A couple

233
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:06,860
of questions. Try to explain to the public.

234
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,366
The main differences between your public law practice

235
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:15,162
and a private law practice? Are there things within your department that we are

236
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:19,114
significantly lacking as opposed

237
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:23,710
to a private law firm? Whether it's with software or any other applications,

238
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,420
certain law firms can afford the newest and the best technology

239
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,946
we have been able to manage. Obviously,

240
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:39,202
with more funds you can purchase more also

241
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:42,726
more of the technology so it's spread out among fewer people when

242
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:45,080
you do that. We have, for example,

243
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,322
body camera footage that has to be reviewed,

244
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:54,374
that has to be edited to pinpoint, to be able to present in

245
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:58,390
any litigation or any other matter. So you do have that constraint,

246
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,170
but we have been able to find

247
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,418
funds to get the software and the technology

248
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:08,798
we need, we think, to be able to do as good a

249
00:16:08,804 --> 00:16:12,766
job as can be expected. Are there any outside of

250
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:16,526
the general fund opportunities for additional dollars or

251
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:21,150
funds that come into your department outside

252
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,420
of property casualty or general fund?

253
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,866
We sometimes recover funds. I mean, we did it,

254
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:32,486
we recovered funds for the city a significant amount when we

255
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:36,680
were sent defective masks during the pandemic. For example,

256
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,406
we recently settled the Allens Creek Reservoir matter

257
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:45,926
that we took issue with state legislation we

258
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:49,222
were able to prevail and we received,

259
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:53,194
even if it's not in direct dollars over time, what I think will

260
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:56,602
be substantial savings to the city. I think you had mentioned

261
00:16:56,656 --> 00:17:00,158
in your presentation that the city of Houston at

262
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:03,742
one point in time was towards the bottom when it came to is that major

263
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:07,102
cities of competitive salary? Yes, that's right. That would be

264
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:10,322
San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth.

265
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:13,758
And also comparing locally here to Harris County and Metro.

266
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:14,900
Where are we now?

267
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,380
We're at the median. We're right there.

268
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,754
We think where we should be for the time being. And what are our efforts

269
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:28,086
for recruitment at the different law firms of the law

270
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:30,950
schools to try to attain the best talent?

271
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,194
Frankly, I think we need to probably take

272
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:40,746
a more direct approach to working with the local law schools, working with

273
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,610
the deans. I've had a couple of conversations.

274
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,122
We do get a lot of interest from

275
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:51,454
lawyers and we have been able to, I think,

276
00:17:51,492 --> 00:17:54,734
hire some talented young lawyers from the local law

277
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:58,014
schools or who coming out of practice here. We do

278
00:17:58,052 --> 00:18:01,074
sometimes have a bit difficulty trying to hire in some of the more

279
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:05,380
specialty areas, for example water rights or It technology.

280
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,610
Thank you. Next, we'll have questions by council member Abby Cayman.

281
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,880
Thank you. Vice Chair city Attorney. Michelle, first off,

282
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,702
just a huge thank you and

283
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:23,880
moment of gratitude to you and the entire team. I know that you break down

284
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,666
all the different specialties that your office takes care of,

285
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:32,406
but I don't think it's really hard to grasp

286
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:36,234
how much you all actually do day in and day

287
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:39,280
out, all of the different matters that you all have eyes on.

288
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,990
Remind me how many people are in your department,

289
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,726
roughly? I think we have about 170.

290
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:50,660
I know that's not precise, but that's okay.

291
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,900
But again, thank you, because I know we often see

292
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,606
items come up where we're seeking outside counsel, but that doesn't

293
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,046
take away from the extensive amount of work

294
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:05,814
that you all do. And thank you for always being so responsive to

295
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:08,440
my office on things. Really quickly,

296
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,166
the court backlogs and delays that we've seen that

297
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:17,354
the county is facing, how has that had an impact, if any,

298
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:20,090
on city related litigation?

299
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,546
I think it's primarily affected it in

300
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:30,526
two ways. One, I think our municipal courts, now that in

301
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:34,746
person hearings and trials are occurring,

302
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:38,750
you have a rush now because of the backlog, although it wasn't quite

303
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,186
what it was in the civil courts. What I think

304
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:45,794
we see in the civil courts in an area that we've had some

305
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:50,222
concern because we've been trying to staff, is really in the tort cases.

306
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:53,774
And so now that the courts are backlogged,

307
00:19:53,822 --> 00:19:57,666
we're seeing more and more, and particularly when we need lawyers

308
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:01,766
and also paralegals, it's been difficult to find paralegals. It's difficult to

309
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:05,114
compete with the private sector, too. So I think that has just really

310
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:08,906
added to the constraints that

311
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:12,394
we have as a public entity law firm during the

312
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:15,994
pandemic. I know, for example, when lots of people are home,

313
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:19,642
we got at least the district offices, a lot more calls,

314
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:24,350
right, of issues and things like that. Did your office see a higher influx

315
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,850
or cases and issues remaining steady?

316
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,102
Yeah, I think that there were

317
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:36,338
particular challenges and different types of issues that had to

318
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:40,354
be raised, that we had to address. And I think much of that happened before

319
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:43,734
I arrived. And I think Deirdre Penny and Randy Zamora and the team

320
00:20:43,772 --> 00:20:46,760
did an excellent job. Absolutely. And finally,

321
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,486
what are the needs, given the financial constraints that the

322
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:53,506
city continues to face, the revenue cap, et cetera?

323
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:57,514
What are the needs of the foreseeable future that we should be aware of that

324
00:20:57,552 --> 00:21:00,762
aren't addressed in this in your budget this

325
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:03,930
year? I think if you had a wish list,

326
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,678
you would probably try to expand more in support

327
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:12,766
services within the department, paralegals the

328
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:16,638
ability to investigate claims, particularly in the neighborhood. For example, if you look

329
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:20,614
at neighborhood services, they filed eleven

330
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:23,822
Chapter 125 lawsuits. They've been successful

331
00:21:23,886 --> 00:21:27,234
in challenging Sobs bars Spiveys on

332
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:30,706
Blodgett Street, for example. But those take time and

333
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:34,538
those take efforts in addition to what HPD provides.

334
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:38,450
Thank you. And if it would be possible, Vice Chair,

335
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,054
to put me back in queue, I'd appreciate it. Sure. I also want to

336
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,766
welcome Council Member Amy Peck, council Member Mary NAN Huffman,

337
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,274
and Council Member David Robinson to the chambers. Next,

338
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:52,554
we'll have questions and staff from District K and

339
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:56,250
District D council member Sally Alcorn.

340
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,618
Thank you, Chair. And shout out to Randy Zamora

341
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:04,558
for all the good work he did on the noise ordinance sitting there behind you

342
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:08,142
on paper reduction. Legal is a

343
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:11,694
lot of paper. And are you all doing, DocuSigns? Are you all trying to cut

344
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:15,218
down on contract papers going back and forth? Can you describe a little bit

345
00:22:15,224 --> 00:22:19,426
of your efforts there? Yeah, I think we

346
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:22,798
pay money to Harris County Department of Ed to archive, and we

347
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:25,880
need to go as paperless as possible.

348
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,086
That can't be done in all instances depending on what a

349
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:32,630
particular court you're in and what's being required.

350
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,378
We have that, but I think everyone in

351
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:40,090
the department is conscious of the need to use less paper.

352
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,626
It affects our bottom line, and frankly, it makes it more

353
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:47,322
efficient in being able to identify and find

354
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:50,846
something after the fact. So there's not really an

355
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:54,510
orchestrated effort. It's just kind of, let's try to do better,

356
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,858
or is there anything kind of in place to there is specific reduction

357
00:22:58,954 --> 00:23:02,834
efforts. There is not a

358
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:06,146
plan. I'm going

359
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:09,106
to take that under advisement and look at it and see what other departments are

360
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:12,146
doing in order to do that. I do know that

361
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:15,990
it just makes us more efficient when we do that. And I think every lawyer,

362
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,494
our lawyers are frankly overwhelmed in what they have to do,

363
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:24,726
and they will always find ways to make it more efficient. But you bring up

364
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:26,540
a good point. Thank you.

365
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,818
That is a good point. I know that my law firm, we try to

366
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:35,066
be efficient with going paperless, but you kind

367
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:38,566
of are also very accustomed

368
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:41,966
to having those paper files in front of you and you like to grab them

369
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:45,694
and write notes and you know where they are. And sometimes

370
00:23:45,812 --> 00:23:49,406
going paperless at a law firm, it sounds like it could be

371
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:53,662
more efficient, but sometimes it could be a little frustrating

372
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:57,202
as well. So I know that that balance is something that you all will continue

373
00:23:57,256 --> 00:23:59,700
to consider and find a way to make it work.

374
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,114
Council member amy Abby Cayman.

375
00:24:03,182 --> 00:24:03,800
Sorry,

376
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,360
it was a close one.

377
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,710
City Attorney as it relates to numbers

378
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,046
and metrics, it's hard, right? Some departments can have easy metrics.

379
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:22,506
Your department, what someone may think is a win

380
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,862
in court is actually a better win because we have a settlement,

381
00:24:25,926 --> 00:24:29,742
less court costs, et cetera. Do you

382
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:32,960
track numbers and things like that? How much

383
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,520
dollars are generated from settlements, things of that nature that would be available?

384
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,074
Yeah, we do. Much of

385
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:46,946
our litigation is defensive, so you also would

386
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:52,110
have to look at the amount sought realistically,

387
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,826
what we felt a judge or jury could award, and if

388
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:59,446
we were able to settle for less things of that nature. We do

389
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:02,678
have litigation where we're the plaintiff that we

390
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:05,740
can look at that. But yeah, we do have that data. Okay,

391
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,810
again, just wondering. I think you all do a phenomenal job,

392
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,674
as council members mentioned,

393
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:15,942
randy, with the sound ordinance, the didras

394
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:21,182
as I like to say on multiple things. But again, the entire team just

395
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:24,320
really appreciate all of y'all's work. Thank you.

396
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,630
Well, again, we want to thank you for your presentation,

397
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,726
City Attorney Michelle, and to you and your entire staff for

398
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:36,580
all the contributions. We know you all do a lot with a little,

399
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,974
and you all do a great job of collaborating and engaging with our offices.

400
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:45,314
So continue the good work and thank you again, and you may be dismissed.

401
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:48,886
Thank you. We will now begin the

402
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:52,130
public comment period. We will start with our virtual

403
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,186
public speakers. Please press star six to unmute. When you

404
00:25:56,208 --> 00:26:00,060
hear your name, the first speaker will be

405
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,786
Saba Blanding. Please press hi.

406
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:06,570
Good afternoon. Can you all hear me okay? Yes, ma'am.

407
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,194
Okay, wonderful. I had a few questions on slide

408
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:15,118
20. It says that the legal department negotiated police and

409
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:19,006
municipal employee union contracts. I was wondering if there's a

410
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:22,674
plan to make this process public like in other cities, and if

411
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:26,066
not, why? I was also curious when and how the

412
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:29,518
Office of Policing Reform and Accountability is planning

413
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:33,346
to implement community led recommendations around policing

414
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:36,962
beyond the mayor's appointees. I was also curious

415
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:40,550
council Member came and addressed this in an earlier department presentation.

416
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,766
But what are plans to extend the prenatal parental

417
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:48,266
and infant wellness leave ordinance? And finally,

418
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,266
I was personally curious about what percentage of funding, for one,

419
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,974
Safe Houston is outside of HPD. Particularly curious

420
00:26:56,022 --> 00:27:00,126
about violence interruption and prevention measures and youth outreach. It makes sense how

421
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:04,238
it's set up on the website by an issue. But just in

422
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:08,030
terms of budgeting, I'm curious how the breakout is with departments.

423
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,306
Ms. Blanding, I'm going to give you some additional time because I know you were

424
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:15,954
kind of running through those questions so that we could

425
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:20,030
ensure that we got it all in the allotted time. But can you please repeat

426
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,414
question one and speak a little slower for

427
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:25,720
us? Yeah,

428
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,880
sorry. You know, I'm trying to get in, like, 23 questions.

429
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:36,646
My first question was that on slide 20, it says that the

430
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:40,614
legal department is the one that negotiates the police and municipal

431
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:43,866
Employees union contracts. And I was curious if

432
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:46,982
there's a plan to make this process public like in other cities,

433
00:27:47,046 --> 00:27:49,820
including in Texas. And if not, why not?

434
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,440
That was my first question. So on that first question,

435
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,938
you are right. The city legal department does negotiate

436
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:03,060
with the Houston Police Officers Union. I think when it comes to

437
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,582
plans moving forward, that is something that will be discussed between the mayor

438
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:11,122
and the city attorney each

439
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:14,914
particular year on their vision and their perspective on what may be beneficial

440
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:18,854
for the city of Houston as it pertains to the negotiation process. We are

441
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:22,582
aware that other cities do have what may

442
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:25,800
be considered a more open process,

443
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,070
but those considerations lie solely with the mayor, his vision,

444
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,170
and working with the city attorney.

445
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,458
Did you need me to repeat my other questions. I know I was trying to

446
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:40,320
get them really quick. Yes, please.

447
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,240
Okay. I was getting a little winded too.

448
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,702
So my second question was when and how is the Office

449
00:28:48,756 --> 00:28:52,570
of Policing Reform and Accountability planning to implement community

450
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,126
led recommendations around policing? So just beyond the appointees,

451
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:59,586
some more community led input? Yeah,

452
00:28:59,608 --> 00:29:02,980
I think that's a great question, and I would like to see that as well.

453
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,906
I would request that the chair of the Public Safety Committee

454
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:11,414
kind of look into that somewhat to see if that's something we can get on

455
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:15,334
the schedule as a way in which we can take questions from

456
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:20,154
the public to be able to submit to that

457
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:23,690
oversight office and then be able to provide

458
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,898
some type of feedback. Or you can always reach out directly to your

459
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:31,354
specific district Council member on advocating

460
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:35,022
for that as well. For the District J office,

461
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:39,194
I can say that I would lean towards trying to find a way to collaborate

462
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:42,866
with Ms. O'core to do maybe a

463
00:29:42,888 --> 00:29:46,414
virtual town hall where we can submit

464
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:50,690
some questions from the public and then be able to provide those answers.

465
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,820
Okay. And to repeat my third question, and this is more

466
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,882
to Council Member Cayman, perhaps you

467
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:05,834
addressed this in an earlier department presentation, but I was curious about any

468
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:10,190
plans to extend the prenatal Parental and Infant Wellness Leave Ordinance

469
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,914
saba as it relates to expansion of the paid parental

470
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:21,602
leave program. All City of

471
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:24,770
Houston employees are currently covered.

472
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,970
The mayor has asked and we as council members are encouraging

473
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,470
affiliated arms of the city that may not be within

474
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,866
council's direct control, for example, Metro, Houston, first, et cetera,

475
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:43,494
to begin looking at that for their employees as

476
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:46,870
well as for contractors, subcontractors,

477
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,886
et cetera. I do know that other work is being done by the Women's

478
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:53,020
Commission, but I cannot speak to that.

479
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,060
Okay, I appreciate that clarification about the process.

480
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,334
And then my final question was what percentage of funding for one

481
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:05,918
Safe Houston is outside of HPD? And I

482
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:09,146
was particularly curious about the violence interruption and prevention

483
00:31:09,178 --> 00:31:12,338
measures and the youth outreach. So right now on the website,

484
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:15,906
it's broken down by domestic violence, which makes sense.

485
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:19,762
But as this is budget hearings and we're looking at particular

486
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:23,442
department budgets, I was curious to see those numbers by

487
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:26,854
department. So that was my final question, and I appreciate the time

488
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:30,406
to kind of repeat in a non rushed manner. Great question.

489
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:33,926
We will get that final answer for you

490
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:37,578
to make sure that we have the specific line items and broken down for you

491
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:41,146
in an itemized fashion. So please ensure that you

492
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:45,206
send that specific question over to the District E at houstontx

493
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:48,250
Gov and then we will respond promptly.

494
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,790
Thank you. Our next public speaker is Mr. Jason Oliver.

495
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,540
Oh, perfect. Okay, good afternoon,

496
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,290
everyone. So, first, let's see.

497
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,464
Okay, so I'm curious about the municipal,

498
00:32:12,532 --> 00:32:15,692
the employee contracts as well and I also

499
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:19,504
know that the municipal contracts are a lot more transparent than,

500
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:23,484
say, the police union. And we haven't had fire negotiations

501
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:27,024
in a long time. But I'm curious about how much

502
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:30,716
in raises have been authorized for each of the three major employee

503
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:34,116
groups. I know that's a little bit detailed, so I'll make sure to

504
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:37,572
send that one in second. This is going

505
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:40,740
along with Council Member Pollard. I know you

506
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:44,116
brought the transparency dashboard project comport.

507
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,576
I'm curious about how many complaints have been received through

508
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:51,352
that dashboard and how can we bring

509
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:55,008
because it doesn't actually publish the complaints like Project Comport

510
00:32:55,044 --> 00:32:58,940
does. I'm hoping that we can bring that back into the scope of

511
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,070
this new dashboard that's been put together. And then finally,

512
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,756
neighborhood support for deed restriction has

513
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:11,488
been a big need that I've heard from community members. I'm curious about

514
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:14,876
if it's possible to expand the types

515
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:18,764
of legal support that the department can offer to communities

516
00:33:18,812 --> 00:33:22,384
and, like, civic clubs that are looking for deed restriction

517
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,876
support. All right, great question.

518
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:30,660
I believe on the employee contracts

519
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,624
fire, they receive 6% increase over

520
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:36,970
the next three years.

521
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,530
Police receive 4%, and municipal employees 3%.

522
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,220
As it pertains to the Police Transparency Dashboard,

523
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,016
those numbers are consistently being reevaluated.

524
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:56,990
And as you have a question to that,

525
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,272
wanting to know more about how many inquiries are coming into that

526
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:06,560
portal, so do I. And so I will be reaching out to Mr. Core for

527
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,452
those answers as well. And I think we need to do a better job

528
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:14,320
as a city in really highlighting the Police Transparency

529
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,052
Dashboard. That's something that I'm proud of, but not enough people

530
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:21,812
kind of understand the functionality of it, as well as

531
00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:25,348
kind of how to navigate it and use it to their benefit. So I'm

532
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:29,224
going to put that on my shoulders to get

533
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:32,964
more engagement from the public and awareness on how to utilize

534
00:34:33,012 --> 00:34:36,588
that. And my office will reach out

535
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:39,164
to you directly. I'm going to make a note of that so that we can

536
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,350
collaborate on getting some engagement. And then

537
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,148
your third question was the

538
00:34:47,314 --> 00:34:50,656
increased deed restriction enforcement support.

539
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:54,396
So, of course, as you heard in the presentation earlier, our legal

540
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:58,290
department is spread pretty thin as it is with all of the different

541
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,524
practice areas that they cover. So to add on to

542
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:07,060
that with civic clubs or HOAs when it comes to D restrictions,

543
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,996
I think would be challenging. So we have to be creative in

544
00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:14,376
our approach in working with Lone Star Legal Aid and others to

545
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:18,024
be able to bring forth those services to the public. I know in District J,

546
00:35:18,142 --> 00:35:21,576
we have several entities like the India House

547
00:35:21,678 --> 00:35:25,316
and Catholic Charities who provide weekend legal

548
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:29,004
services for residents at no cost. And so

549
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:32,444
we need to do a better job in maybe getting that

550
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:35,724
information out to our constituents. And so I would

551
00:35:35,762 --> 00:35:39,676
request that everyone please sign up for your district council.

552
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:43,536
Members newsletters because they put a lot of good information

553
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:47,072
out there regarding those issues. And I know with the district J.

554
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:50,608
Pollard Press, we try to provide information

555
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:54,576
on free legal services each month for our residents as

556
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:55,170
well.

557
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,910
That concludes the public speakers list.
