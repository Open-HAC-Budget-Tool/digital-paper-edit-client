1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,474
And I think this does conclude our special called BFA Committee meeting.

2
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:08,750
So. Thank you, Controller. We will now begin our Controller's Office

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,298
Budget Workshop. So, Controller, I believe at this time we're going to invite

4
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:15,982
your Deputy Director, Leonard Polk, up for his

5
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:20,186
presentation and give him a moment to get settled.

6
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:23,486
And thank you again, Controller, for your words of

7
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:24,270
wisdom.

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,760
Okay.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,374
And I think our presentation is all queued up and

10
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:36,714
essentially ready to go, so we're a little ahead of schedule,

11
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:40,254
but we're doing great. So go ahead. You don't want to take

12
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:43,086
a 20 minutes? No, we're going to get right into it. We're going to get

13
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:45,666
right into it. I used to be in that chair. I remember how important it

14
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:49,138
is to move people through. Yes, sir. Thank you.

15
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:52,610
Okay. On behalf of the 53

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,862
almost employees working tirelessly to protect our City's fiscal health,

17
00:00:55,916 --> 00:01:00,098
I'm pleased to present the proposed FY 23 budget

18
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:03,762
for the Office of the City Controller. As mentioned, Deputy Director Leonard

19
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:07,146
Polk is here to assist me in answering some of the

20
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:13,002
more detailed questions, but we'll go ahead and get

21
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:17,126
into the presentation. First and foremost, the mission of the Controller's

22
00:01:17,158 --> 00:01:21,294
Office is project the financial integrity of Houston's municipal government.

23
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:25,674
To accomplish this, the Office is responsible for managing all payroll

24
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:28,570
and vendor payments, conducting audits,

25
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,702
managing a $5 billion investment portfolio and a $14

26
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:37,006
billion debt portfolio, which we do in house, preparing accurate

27
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:40,974
and timely financial statements, providing fiscal leadership

28
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:44,040
on policy issues relating to the City's financial health.

29
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,974
We are the independent authority to conduct performance reviews and

30
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:52,402
audits of the City's Departments, and we assess the City and region's

31
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:56,418
future financial outlook with accurate forecasts of projected revenues and

32
00:01:56,444 --> 00:02:00,202
expenses, among other indicators. As we'll discuss

33
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:04,266
today, the proposed budget for FY 23 totals $8,954,843,

34
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:08,054
and that represents

35
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:11,902
an increase of 2.5% from the fiscal year 22

36
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:17,040
budgeted amount of $8,730,277.

37
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,306
So this increase represents a net change of $224,566,

38
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:25,038
and that's primarily

39
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:28,670
attributable to rising amounts in restricted accounts.

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,406
So the increase in pension contributions,

41
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,080
contractual pay raises for municipal employees as well.

42
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,842
Of the total proposed operating budget,

43
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:43,542
84%, or $7,548,436

44
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:47,014
of expenses, are associated with personnel costs.

45
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:50,570
So, similar to the overall City, the Office

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,554
of City Controller does not have revenue to report, and there is

47
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,720
no change in the FTE count from FY 22 to FY 23.

48
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,486
So looking at if we can go back sorry, one slide and

49
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:07,550
the chart. Looking at

50
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,226
our organizational chart, the Controller's Office. We have six divisions

51
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,786
that help protect the fiscal well being of the City, its enterprises, and its

52
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:18,446
component units. Our Operations Division is the workhorse

53
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:21,982
of the six and responsible for making sure City employees and vendors

54
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:25,446
get paid. Our Treasury Division is responsible for

55
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:29,346
managing a 5 billion investment portfolio and a $14 billion

56
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:33,830
debt portfolio. Again, both of those are done in house without outside managers.

57
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,978
And our Audit Division is responsible for the audit functions of

58
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,750
the City, including managing fraud, waste and abuse hotline.

59
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,114
In total, the FY 23 proposed budget of 8.9

60
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:48,266
million helps the nearly 53 Controller

61
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:51,854
Office team members across six divisions accomplish these key

62
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:54,030
tasks. Next slide.

63
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,580
To highlight the roles and responsibility of the Controller's Office,

64
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,930
we provide financial oversight of city operations.

65
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,690
We develop financial reports such as the Monthly Financial Report

66
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,658
and the annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the annual audit,

67
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:16,530
and perhaps most importantly, we process payments

68
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,646
to vendors and employees. And as defined in the

69
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,146
City Charter, the Controller's Office is responsible for certifying

70
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:27,754
the availability of funds for council action and the

71
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:31,610
audit functions of the City and its reporting units. Next slide.

72
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,314
So, as we mentioned previously, we don't have any revenue to report.

73
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:39,706
So we'll go to the next slide, and again no

74
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:42,640
revenue report. So we'll move on to slide six.

75
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,230
So the total proposed budget of 8.9 million is 2.5%

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,840
higher than the FY 22 budgeted amount.

77
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,930
The FY 21 actual is 7,813,000

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,170
946,000. And you can see the FY 22

79
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,038
budgeted is $8,730,277.

80
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:09,782
So the variance on those is 224,566,

81
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:12,680
again, previously mentioned 2.57%.

82
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,694
So we've seen a decrease in funding available for the audit

83
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:20,186
function and that is something that I know we've discussed around this

84
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:21,610
council table.

85
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,754
Between the term or retirement pay and competitive

86
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:29,998
edge among audit practitioners when compared to the

87
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:33,102
private sector, our audit division is doing more with

88
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:36,446
less. And we'll move on

89
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:37,950
to the next slide.

90
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,486
We can see the total proposed operating budget.

91
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:47,646
84%, or seven and a half million of expenses, are associated

92
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:51,598
with personnel costs. And of the remaining 16%,

93
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:54,690
1.4 million, a majority of expenses,

94
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,390
1.3 million. Of that 96% are associated with other services

95
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,910
and charges. Next slide.

96
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,240
In looking@the.net change to the FY 22

97
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,766
current budget, the FY 23 proposed budget includes an increase

98
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:16,006
of $51,970 as a result of service chargeback

99
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:19,858
accounts for items such as fuel, electricity. It counts.

100
00:06:19,894 --> 00:06:25,406
It accounts an increase of 139,209

101
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:28,830
as a result of municipal pay increases through the Hope contract,

102
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,706
and a decrease of $9,090

103
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:35,678
due mainly to health benefit adjustments.

104
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,700
So we're projecting a decrease of 4000 in auditing services.

105
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,634
We have an increase of 20,000 for miscellaneous

106
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:47,702
support services, a decrease of 20,000 for information

107
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:51,922
resource services, and a decrease of 5000 for miscellaneous

108
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:54,550
other services. Next slide.

109
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,294
We see a major decrease in health insurance for active civilian

110
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:03,626
personnel and that would be a reduction of $42,506.

111
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:07,114
And we saw

112
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:11,662
the increase of 134,141 seen

113
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:15,322
in the FY 23 Hope salary adjustment. And that's attributable

114
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:18,814
to the contractually obligated pay increases that were

115
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,820
negotiated earlier this year.

116
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,930
Next slide.

117
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,334
So, in summary, expenditure increases are attributable to

118
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:32,846
rising amounts and restricted accounts. So it's really not anything that we're

119
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:35,798
adding. It's all nondiscretionary.

120
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:39,238
Those are increased pension contributions, contractually obligated,

121
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,842
municipal employee pay increases. We've really tried

122
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:46,854
to manage our budget very efficiently. I think we

123
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:50,446
and Leonard sometimes gets frustrated with me, but we always

124
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:53,994
go under budget. We're trying to be a good taxpayer

125
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:58,110
steward. But I would say, in closing,

126
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,886
if you look at the comparable amount of auditors to other Texas

127
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,762
cities, namely Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, we're well below

128
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:10,030
the number of auditors. And again, we talked about in the previous presentation

129
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,682
about making investments to kind of save recurring

130
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,794
money in the future. We've been and historically

131
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:21,058
shown that we can find and utilize savings

132
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:25,180
for the city through our audit division. So I would say

133
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,642
some of the unmet needs I know people have asked

134
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:33,862
about, that we really need more auditors.

135
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:38,234
So we'll move on to the next slide that's questions.

136
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:42,874
Thank you very much, Controller. I believe that covers

137
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,914
quite a bit here and we've got a couple of council members in the queue.

138
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:49,098
We'll start with Council member Sally Alcorn. Thank you,

139
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:52,254
Chair. You don't have any revenues,

140
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:55,570
but you make a lot of money for the city and treasury and investments.

141
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,678
Can you talk about that? About what, like rate of returns

142
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,720
for the past year?

143
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,754
Yes, overall, we have seen interest rates

144
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:09,922
rising. It's been, quite frankly, a little bit of a challenge

145
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:13,478
in our investment fund. When you look at the yield curve and

146
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:17,206
as rates rise, that yield curve tends to slope up positively.

147
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:21,318
You have a principle of duration and that's the time that your investment

148
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:24,742
is locked in. It's been a little bit of a dance

149
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:28,294
to try and get that duration perfectly

150
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:31,886
matched to beat the benchmark. We continue to think that rates are

151
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:35,438
going to continue to rise, so we don't want to lock in something at

152
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:39,650
3% and rates go to 4% because then we leave money on the table.

153
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,434
Equally complicating is the increase in

154
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:50,034
rates on our debt portfolio, because the opportunities to refinance are

155
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:52,850
now getting less opportune.

156
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,720
Luckily, again, my background in investment banking, eight years

157
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,350
working for an investment bank that primarily did fixed income,

158
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,226
I knew that this low interest rate environment was going to be a huge opportunity

159
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:08,906
for the city of Houston. We have to

160
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:12,700
date received over $600 million

161
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,034
in interest rate savings from refinancing the

162
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:19,840
city's debt. We've been very aggressive with this.

163
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,514
Other cities have been successful.

164
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:26,526
I think Houston is maybe one of the most successful. We are one of the

165
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:30,082
largest cities, so that number is quite high. But those

166
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:34,002
opportunities are probably going to be less

167
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:37,522
opportune going forward. But it's great that we did this,

168
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:40,770
because when you look at that and that's city wide,

169
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,286
but on average, a period of around 15 years

170
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:48,662
of a weighted average. So this is $30

171
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:52,486
million, $40 million a year that the

172
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:56,338
city is not paying in debt service. So that's savings. We'll continue to

173
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,262
identify those and be aggressive. It's just in this particular environment

174
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,026
and it all goes up and down. Eventually, maybe the rates will come back

175
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:07,114
down. We'll have more opportunity. Thanks. Thank you, council member.

176
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:10,506
And thank you, Controller. Next we'll hear from council member Amy

177
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:12,910
Peck. Thank you. And thank you, Controller.

178
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,906
Related to the reduction in your audit division.

179
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:20,470
As you know, I want to see more audits in the city and not fewer.

180
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,034
So can you talk a little bit about what that reduction will mean in terms

181
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:27,566
of how many fewer audits or what you're

182
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:30,370
able to do less with the reduction?

183
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,854
Yeah. So we'll use council office as

184
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:39,014
an example. Those of you all council members have seen through

185
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:43,122
these tough times with COVID and other reductions

186
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:46,070
in overall expenditures,

187
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,786
especially with costs like health care and pension and

188
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:53,546
all these other things rising. Unfortunately, we have

189
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:57,150
not been able to invest as much as we'd like to in the audit division.

190
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,710
We would love an example of a great

191
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,646
opportunity, if there was a way to find some of this federal money, to go

192
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:08,110
out and hire more auditors.

193
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,170
I was looking in my notes.

194
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,994
Houston has about ten. We have ten auditors or

195
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:18,946
ten total staff in our audit division. Austin has 28,

196
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:22,840
Dallas has 20, san Antonio has 23.

197
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,426
And so per employee,

198
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:31,734
houston has one auditor per 2122

199
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:35,466
employees, austin has one per 550. Dallas has

200
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,650
one per 700, and San Antonio has one per 500.

201
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,794
So they're a lot more in line. So just

202
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:46,842
to wrap up, if someone wanted to and I've made this plea before if someone

203
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:50,062
wanted to offer a budget amendment to fund more

204
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:53,886
auditors using some of the fungible ARPA money, I think

205
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:57,406
that would be a worthwhile investment. And I can tell you that if you look

206
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:01,090
at the amount of savings versus the audit budget,

207
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,666
it's a great return on investment. We spend a million and a half dollars a

208
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:09,086
year in audit, but during the time I've

209
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,854
been in office, I think now over 11 million in savings.

210
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:15,078
So, again, I think it's a good investment, and I

211
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:18,934
think with a bigger team, we could take on bigger audits and be more

212
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:21,862
effective in finding efficiencies for the city.

213
00:13:21,996 --> 00:13:25,686
Thank you, Controller. That amendment is already on my list. All right, thank you.

214
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:29,318
Thank you. Wish come true. We got a follow up question from Council

215
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:33,094
Member Alcord. Thank you. It's my understanding we're not to submit budget amendments

216
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:36,060
for ARPA money, but not to say that that won't happen.

217
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,458
And then I was going to ask you about the paper reduction.

218
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,042
I am a firm believer that the city still uses citywide

219
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:47,178
entirely too much paper. And can you talk about what you're

220
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:51,906
doing with the invoices and how you really are trying to go paperless in

221
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:55,250
the Controller's office? Yeah, great question.

222
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,540
We've been working on this for some time.

223
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,934
Curiously, Harvey actually pushed our hand on a lot of these things.

224
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:06,758
We've moved to DocuSign to digitally sign a lot of

225
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:10,230
contracts, so that eliminates the movement of paper

226
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,438
in the Controller's office. We have moved to eliminate paper checks

227
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:18,714
and reduce invoices. There's still some work to do to

228
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:22,742
get truly paperless invoices. And just like with the DocuSign,

229
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:26,806
when we went through that process, we had five different departments

230
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:30,366
that wanted to use each their own system. And in

231
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:34,074
order to properly memorialize those signatures,

232
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:37,454
everyone needs to be on the same system. We were able to essentially get everyone

233
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:40,866
to have buy in. We'll need a little bit more buy in from all the

234
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:44,066
departments to get truly paperless invoicing. But I

235
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:47,986
would say that that is the future. I think even

236
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:51,646
around the council table and us still signing

237
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:54,790
a lot of these contracts that are paper, I know Leonard

238
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,982
helps in every week going through with our team

239
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:02,594
to sign off on all these contracts, but they're paper contracts that are being physically

240
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:06,566
moved. And I would say that that's something that could be a huge savings

241
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:10,060
for the administration to move to a truly paperless system.

242
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,938
It's difficult to transition, but a lot of the other cities and

243
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:18,860
smaller cities in this region, sugar Land, Paralym, Woodlands are

244
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,826
using Or, Sugar Land and Pearland are using these types of systems.

245
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:27,006
So something I think is a great idea. Thank you very much. And thank

246
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:30,978
you, I think actually for the TTI committee, we've heard from

247
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:35,102
the Houston Information Technology System about such technology being embraced

248
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,946
and hopefully soon incorporated. So again, Controller, thank you for

249
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:42,510
your remarks. I believe that's the end of our questions from council

250
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,166
and staff. And with that we will move. I just

251
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:49,746
wanted to take a point of personal privilege, please. I do have some staff

252
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:53,270
members. If you'd recognize your team, that'd be great. You guys are always welcome.

253
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,698
And I know we are in constant communication with many of

254
00:15:56,704 --> 00:16:00,118
you, but I wanted to recognize our Chief Deputy City Controller,

255
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:03,446
Shannon Nobles, our Chief Operating Officer,

256
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:07,334
and Deputy Controller Alex Obergon. Vernon Lewis

257
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:11,350
is our Treasury Analyst, john Seideler is our Communications

258
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,766
Director, and Sharice Mosely, who heads our Treasury Division. I want

259
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:18,190
to just thank them and Leonard, as you all know,

260
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,566
this is a lot of work and we a lot of times get up here

261
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:25,346
and talk and look good, but it's these people that get us ready to

262
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:27,666
be able to do the things that we do. So thank them and thank you

263
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:30,882
all for your time today. Thank you, Controller. We know you have a great team

264
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:34,070
and we appreciate all the work you all do upstairs.

265
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,750
Thank you again. We've got two public speakers,

266
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,718
both of whom we believe are online virtually and

267
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:45,450
prepared with a question. And we'll start with Ms. Saba Blanding.

268
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,506
Good morning. Good to ask you all some more

269
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:53,180
questions today. Good morning.

270
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,854
My question is, and this is, I believe, directly to

271
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:03,534
council members, if you could add one to 2

272
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,686
million to the current budget, if that

273
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,740
magically appeared, what department and or service would you fund and why?

274
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,046
Well, I appreciate that question and we'll

275
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,634
commit it to the record. Ms. Blanding, thank you for that. I don't see

276
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,834
any council members jumping to respond,

277
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:26,598
but it is an interesting question, and we will consider

278
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:29,640
what we would do with an extra million or $2.

279
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,866
Thank you for that. Appreciate you being here today.

280
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:37,194
Thanks. And next, we'll hear from Mr.

281
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:40,666
Jason Oliver. Mr. Oliver, if you're with

282
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:44,698
us on mute. Yes, I'm here. There you are.

283
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:48,382
Go ahead, sir. So my first

284
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:52,298
question is to the controller. Thank you for the presentation.

285
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:55,678
Where are we in terms of the Checkbook program

286
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:59,470
implementation? Is the data and information

287
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,930
prepared? Some of us, if that information

288
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,250
is available, some of us in the public would be interested in working

289
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,140
on a version of it, depending on the city's timeline. So we're trying to get

290
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,286
an estimated time of completion for that. And then the

291
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:19,094
second question is to

292
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:23,126
Council Member Robinson. You had mentioned that policy budget amendments will be

293
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:26,694
out of order. I'm trying to figure out why the restriction

294
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,700
on budget amendments this year.

295
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,714
We're going to start with your first question, Mr. Oliver. Let's see if the

296
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:39,200
controller has something to respond. So the now

297
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,070
Open Finance, what we previously dubbed the Checkbook,

298
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,214
that program that we started was started and halted

299
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:52,114
and then restarted about a year

300
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:55,858
later. From the most recent report I've seen, there's about 40%

301
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:59,970
of the project that's been complete. I think the deadline

302
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,920
is September, October of this year.

303
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,622
But we would like to see that project completed and done

304
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:11,640
because I think, again, there'll be a lot of opportunity to

305
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,226
scrutinize expenditures and maybe find some more efficiencies. If not

306
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:21,034
only the Controller's office but council and every

307
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:25,538
citizen of Houston has the access to see in real time every expenditure,

308
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:29,870
not just vendor payments, but payroll and other expenditures.

309
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,594
So we've been cautiously optimistic

310
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:37,214
that this project will get online. I would just add the

311
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:41,266
genesis of this whole exercise was a

312
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:44,980
joint effort between the mayor's office and the Controller's office to

313
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,082
utilize and be eligible for a transparency star,

314
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:53,362
which is the State of Texas financial transparency ranking

315
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:57,618
system. And you get stars for different accomplishments.

316
00:19:57,714 --> 00:20:01,254
Namely, the first one has to be putting all of your

317
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:05,290
expenses online. We're the only major city in the country that

318
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,970
doesn't have our payments online. But unfortunately,

319
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,594
we will not be eligible even if we do the Open Finance project

320
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,794
for that transparency star. We'll continue to be the only

321
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:21,002
major city in the country without the transparency

322
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:24,554
star, in the sense that if you don't have five years of historical

323
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:27,966
data, you don't qualify for the star. So I don't believe that

324
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:31,700
the Open Finance has agreed to be able to put that historical information.

325
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,914
It's something that we included in our project.

326
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:38,690
So I would say I'm hopeful that the project

327
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,082
will go online. I think it's going to be a great tool for not only

328
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:45,426
council and staff, but also for citizens of Houston.

329
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,110
And as a taxpayer, I want to be able to have this tool

330
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,234
available to me, but we also need to push to put that historical

331
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:56,394
data on there so that we are eligible to get that first

332
00:20:56,432 --> 00:21:00,220
transparency star, because the other stars we're already doing.

333
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,230
We're already doing all the transparency stuff around the debt, the investments,

334
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,394
but we cannot get those stars until you get your first star, which is the

335
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:12,206
transparency portal and putting that five years of historical data on

336
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:15,530
there. So I would encourage this body, to encourage the administration

337
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,166
as a part of that project, to do the five years of historical data so

338
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:22,866
that we can in fact get we would probably get three or four stars right

339
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:26,830
off the bat. Thank you, Controller. And I do believe we're hearing

340
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,402
regular progress being made towards that goal. So hopefully, Mr.

341
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,606
Oliver, that addresses your first question. And as to your second

342
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:37,090
point about the words I read at the beginning of the meeting,

343
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,514
that coming from the administration is not a new restriction,

344
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:44,214
but really the mayor focusing on amendments

345
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:48,326
and trying to get ahead of those this year by reminding council

346
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:52,870
members in our offices that policy amendments are not appropriate

347
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,474
and will not be considered and

348
00:21:56,512 --> 00:21:59,894
to focus on the budget. So appreciating your comments.

349
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:03,482
I want to thank you for being here again and I believe that

350
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:07,462
brings us to the conclusion of the public speaking component of your presentation.

351
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,994
Control Are. Thank you very much for being here and your

352
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:14,386
whole team and thank you

353
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:17,586
so much. We'll take a short break before our

354
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:21,234
next presentation from the mayor's office. And with

355
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:24,210
that, we'll take a brief adjournment.
