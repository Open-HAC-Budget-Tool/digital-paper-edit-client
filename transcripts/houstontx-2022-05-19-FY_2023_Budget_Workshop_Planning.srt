1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,760
That concludes the public speakers list.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,590
And now we will move on to welcome

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,962
the Director, margaret Wallace Brown and Roger Hamilton,

4
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:17,950
to provide the Planning and Development Budget workshop presentation.

5
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,634
Welcome, Director, and the floor is yours. Thank you. Good afternoon,

6
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:49,058
council members. Let me begin by introducing

7
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:52,346
the team that I have with me today. We may be relying on them for

8
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:55,338
some answers to questions, so I want to make sure I introduce them.

9
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:59,930
First of all, at my right is Roger Hamilton. He is our department CFO

10
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,626
and he leads the finance team, which includes Alejandro Garcia,

11
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:07,134
Maribel Torres and Donnella Gamilian. Also with us

12
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:11,210
today is our communication team and council liaison, elise Marion

13
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,754
and Anna Sedillo. And then the other part

14
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:18,174
of our leadership in our department is our Deputy Director,

15
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:22,014
Jennifer Austland, and our Assistant Director in Chief Transportation

16
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:25,426
Planner, David Fields. And so I may be leaning on some of

17
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:28,886
them for some of your questions. Let me go ahead and

18
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:32,438
start. So my name is Margaret Wallace Brown. I'm the director of

19
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:36,002
the Planning and Development Department. And before I present an overview

20
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:39,126
of the Planning and Development Department budget, I'd like to take a moment to

21
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:42,806
reaffirm my deep appreciation for your support of the planning

22
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:46,234
team and all the work we do. We take great pride in being

23
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,038
a resource for the Mayor and Council districts and our fellow departments.

24
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:53,134
We take our work very seriously when we work with you.

25
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:56,890
In 2021, we adopted a new mission statement

26
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,446
growing and Preserving Houston's Diverse Communities to create a

27
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:03,678
resilient city with record number of platts and

28
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:06,542
permits and an increasing portfolio of new projects.

29
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:09,874
2021 has been our most productive year and

30
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:13,886
our most innovative year. I'd like to demonstrate how we are fulfilling that mission

31
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:17,270
as I share a few highlight reels of our accomplishments.

32
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,654
First of all, our platting requests hit an all time high with

33
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:24,966
over more than 3000 platts in 2021. That was

34
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:28,634
a 25% increase on our previous record year,

35
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:32,682
which was 2020. We also saw a steady increase in building

36
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,886
permits, with 22 300 building permits planners

37
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:40,060
reviewing approximately 1200 plans per month.

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,514
On a different note, Friedmanstown was designated as the city's first heritage

39
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:48,974
district. We also added ten more landmarks, a new

40
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:52,386
historic district, and we have another one in the works. Our team is

41
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:56,062
engaging with residents in Glenburg Valley, where we conducted a window workshop

42
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:59,570
and worked on design guidelines for three historic districts.

43
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,018
More accomplishments include our transportation planning area,

44
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:07,506
which our Vision Zero Action plan earned a Gold

45
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:11,586
Award for implementation from the Texas Chapter of the American Planning Association.

46
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:15,282
Vision Zero is implementing all 13 priority actions,

47
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:18,582
and highlights include continuing engagement to identify

48
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:22,150
locations of concern updating the city street designs,

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,014
redesigning ten high injury network locations,

50
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:28,486
and receiving $4 million in highway safety improvement

51
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:32,414
funding from Techstot. The first more space Main

52
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:35,774
Street patio opened with Little Dipper. Followed shortly after

53
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:39,114
that with Shay McElroy, the Flying Saucer and Finn Hall.

54
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:42,814
The More space Main Street initiative was a great success

55
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:47,634
and was approved for an extension, keeping it going through 2023 in

56
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:50,878
2021, together with our partners, we completed the Austin

57
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:56,370
Hutchins, Gray, Leland and Polk Street Bikeways,

58
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,438
including Cullen Boulevard. Also, they were initiated in response to

59
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:04,274
the Build 50 challenge. We added the Clear Lake West Chase Trail

60
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:08,070
extensions and segments of the Spring Branch Trail. So now

61
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,434
we have High comfort bikeway off of East Freeway at Federal and

62
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:14,986
Maxi and these complete 40 miles of

63
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:18,140
high comfort bike network in our city.

64
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,366
The transportation team also engaged with the community to build safety improvements in

65
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:25,918
Briar Meadows and set a guest with council members

66
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:29,882
Thomas and Jackson. We partnered with Harris County Health Department,

67
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:33,090
received funding from MD Anderson to start the city's first

68
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,900
Safe Routes to School program in Acres Home.

69
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,422
Our Livable Places Action Committee celebrated its first anniversary,

70
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:44,894
reached consensus on recommendations from Chapter 42 technical

71
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,582
amendments, which you graciously approved yesterday, established a focus

72
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:52,466
group to work on conservation districts, and released a single family residential

73
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:56,198
survey that garnered over 1200 responses. We received

74
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:59,782
a grant from the AARP, which we used to organize

75
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:03,386
an accessory dwelling unit garage apartment for

76
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:07,334
many design competition to promote compact, affordable housing

77
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:10,846
design options for Houstonians. The grant funded a series of

78
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:14,282
workshops and the design contest and culminated in the publication

79
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:17,914
of a book, all of which was managed, implemented and designed

80
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:21,458
by our staff in the complete communities planning and

81
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:25,486
development led initiatives such as Neighborhood Character preservation Tool Workshops,

82
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:29,170
Lights on Houston Community Events Building Food

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,860
Security Workshop and working with CenterPoint Energy Agency's Action Program.

84
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,894
So these are our accomplishments over the past year, but I also want to provide

85
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:41,174
a very brief overview of our priorities, new projects and

86
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:44,422
frequently recurring quests that we're expecting to come for the coming year.

87
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:47,602
As all of you know, we're working with council districts on Redistricting,

88
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:52,054
both on the ongoing public engagement as well as the technical and data analysis

89
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,178
support for realignment of district boundaries. That process

90
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:59,214
will continue through September of 2022. Staff is

91
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:02,686
creating a team to provide demographic and population projections for

92
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,314
the city of Houston. Up until now, we've not projected population,

93
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:09,802
we've simply identified what other agencies

94
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:13,146
have calculated. So projections will be new for us

95
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:16,514
and for the city, and it will support other city departments in right

96
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:20,286
sizing their service operations. Our transportation planners

97
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:23,506
have so many projects, it's hard to keep up, but I

98
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:26,054
hope you had a chance to listen to the Mayor's State of Mobility address this

99
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:29,302
afternoon. A transcript and a video is going to be available later

100
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,614
today, but in addition to that, we have increased coordination with

101
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:36,278
Metro, specifically about the University Corridor and the

102
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:40,518
Intercatty Bus Rapid Transit lines. We're also receiving frequent requests

103
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:44,650
for connectivity studies in various council districts and

104
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,134
Houston is the largest city in the United States without a map designating

105
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:52,362
truck routes, which means that freight travel often cuts through residential neighborhoods.

106
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,870
So in the coming year, the citywide Freight Map project

107
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,374
will coordinate with council members and neighborhoods to secure some relief for

108
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:02,894
them. And when it comes to increasing Houstonian's equity,

109
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:06,926
we're still collaborating with the Kinder Institute on the Equity Indicators

110
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,910
project to provide transparency, accountability and to refine

111
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,034
operations for all city departments to increase equity

112
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:17,574
across our city. The initial analysis is nearly completed but

113
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:21,046
and the program will require ongoing management and measure to

114
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:23,190
measure success in closing the gaps.

115
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,894
Our ongoing work with neighborhood resiliency plans address storm

116
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:31,254
recovery, watershed boundaries and other challenges like climate adaption,

117
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:34,822
risk reduction, economic development, infrastructure modernization

118
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:38,566
and social empowerment. Currently there are three plans to be completed

119
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:41,754
by 2023, with another three to be completed afterward.

120
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:45,438
And staff is developing a replicable framework for other neighborhoods to

121
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:48,926
follow in creating their own resiliency plans. And our

122
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:52,574
minimum lot size and minimum building line programs, which are so popular

123
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:56,510
for neighborhoods, are reaching their 20 year threshold,

124
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,130
which means that we're creating significant increase in we're getting

125
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,194
requests for significant increase in renewals on top of the average projected

126
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:07,430
new applications. And finally,

127
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,070
historic preservation team we've created.

128
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,006
Two new historic districts have been petitioned and we

129
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:17,966
are working with the Economic Development Office for review and administration

130
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:22,010
of the historic Site tax exemption program, which is growing in popularity.

131
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,586
We expect conservation districts to presented to city Council within the next

132
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:29,846
few months. A conservation district for Independence Heights will

133
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:33,694
probably follow shortly thereafter. We see conservation districts as

134
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:37,786
providing neighborhoods another tool for protecting their character. So I'm

135
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:41,326
excited about all the partnerships we've forged and look forward to working with

136
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:44,898
you on another collaborative year. Let's dig into the numbers

137
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:49,102
now. The Planning and Development Department operates out of four separate

138
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,802
funds. It's important to note, and I will discuss this in detail later,

139
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:56,838
that while expenditures are specific to a fund's function,

140
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,194
our team members operate in a silo free environment.

141
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:03,362
In the Planning Department, it's talent, not titles,

142
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:06,746
that informs the work of a team member does. And very few of our team

143
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:10,374
members conduct one job within one fund. Most handle

144
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:14,010
projects in multiple funds and we assign the costs accordingly.

145
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,894
I'm telling you this because we stress importance

146
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,986
of knowledge beyond their cubicle. It's my belief that

147
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:24,542
this provides better professional training to our team and makes for a better city

148
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:28,698
employee. The result is that we utilize a series of inner fund chargebacks

149
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:32,062
and reimbursements that will seem confusing at first, but I'll explain

150
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:35,314
them in detail as we get to them. So the first

151
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:38,514
fund is the city's general fund. The FY 23

152
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:46,358
budget is $3,000,925 $3,925,384

153
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:49,510
with 23.1 full time equivalents.

154
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,686
The fund supports our community engagement and transportation planning efforts as

155
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,642
well as our management and customer support services. The second

156
00:09:57,696 --> 00:10:01,286
fund, the Department's Special Revenue Fund, supports the work of the majority

157
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:05,222
of our team members. This fund receives fees

158
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:08,854
from and pays for services related to land development

159
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:11,998
activities within the 671 sq. Mi of the

160
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:15,914
City of Houston, as well as the 1600 additional square miles

161
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:19,214
in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. The team

162
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:22,802
at the permitting center are also on this fund. The third

163
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,434
fund, the city's central services revolving fund also known as

164
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:30,082
the Enterprise GIS or just simply Egis fund,

165
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:33,774
supports the work of our GIS team located both at 611

166
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:37,430
Walker and at the Houston Emergency center as a central service

167
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,566
revolving fund operation. All expenditures in this

168
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:44,182
area are charged back to the department that consume our services under their

169
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:47,266
restricted accounts. The FY 23 budget

170
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:51,370
is $1,736,847

171
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,410
with 11.5 full time employees.

172
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,682
And finally, the Historic Preservation Fund, which is a small fund used

173
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:02,026
for nonpersonal special preservation activities that was

174
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:06,074
created several years ago with the proceeds of the sale of some city owned historic

175
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:09,614
fire stations. I'd like to take the time to discuss the

176
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:12,526
programming and the core functions we handle in the Planning Department.

177
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:16,846
Our department consists of seven divisions community and Regional Planning,

178
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,778
transportation Planning, GIS Services,

179
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:22,738
historic Preservation, Development Services,

180
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:26,774
Management Services and the Director's Office for

181
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,882
Community and Regional Planning. This group is led by Deputy Director Jennifer Austland

182
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:34,182
and directly supports community planning with programs such as Complete

183
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:38,134
Communities minimum Lot Size Building Line prohibited yard parking.

184
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:42,150
They are also responsible for broader regional planning, such as annexations

185
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,182
and changes to boundaries, including the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction.

186
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:49,950
This group is the group currently working with you on Council Redistricting.

187
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,586
The next division is Transportation planning. Led by David Fields, the city's

188
00:11:56,618 --> 00:12:00,602
Chief Transportation Planner, the division leads the city's

189
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:04,002
systems level strategic Mobility planning. This function

190
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,050
includes management of the city's Complete Streets and Transportation Plan,

191
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,126
Vision Zero, the Major Thoroughfare and Freeway plan, the Houston

192
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:15,922
Bike Plan, rail related planning, local area studies

193
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,110
and external transportation funding and grant efforts.

194
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,186
This is the team that's facilitating the discussions about the North Houston Highway

195
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:27,254
Improvement Project, and some of our newest initiatives include connectivity

196
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:30,742
studies for Houston neighborhoods the GIS

197
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:34,118
Services Division. Led by Assistant Director Larry Nerth,

198
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:37,978
this division manages and maintains much of the city's GIS information,

199
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:41,718
provides and coordinates regional emergency providers with mapping and

200
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:45,214
analysis for effective emergency services. As I often

201
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:48,734
say, if you need an ambulance and it can find you, that's because our

202
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:52,626
GIS group told it how to get there. This is also the group that

203
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:56,402
provides the map indicating services, facilities and developments within your

204
00:12:56,456 --> 00:13:00,382
district. The next division is historic preservation.

205
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:04,146
Roman McAllen is the city's Historic Preservation Officer and he leads

206
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:08,194
this group. They facilitate the process of identifying and maintaining the city's

207
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:11,366
historic resources through engagement with neighborhoods and

208
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:14,962
property owners. This group manages certificates of appropriateness

209
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:18,422
applications pertaining to Chapter 33 of the Code of Ordinances,

210
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:22,810
as well as coordinating state and federal review of historic resources

211
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,030
development services. Deputy Director Jennifer Austin

212
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,002
leads this division also which oversees many development related activities

213
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:34,638
including subdivision and development, platting and site plan review at the

214
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:37,854
Houston Permitting Center. The last two

215
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:41,506
are management Services and support the division responsible for

216
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:45,166
operational support of the department, including budgeting, purchasing commission

217
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,102
support, customer service and public information and open records.

218
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:53,310
And then finally, the Director's Office, which handles all internal communications

219
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,298
such as employee onboarding and training, as well as communications with

220
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,520
the Mayor's office in your council, district offices and the public.

221
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,494
Moving on to Revenues by Funds this

222
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:09,526
slide is an overview of the proposed FY 23 revenue by fund in comparison

223
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,630
to the department's estimated FY 22 revenue.

224
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,938
Overall, we are proposing a revenue increase of 139,000

225
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:21,254
across all funds focusing on the General Fund line.

226
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:25,514
Revenue into the general fund is primarily from a chargeback from the department's

227
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:29,006
special revenue fund. As I mentioned earlier, team members who

228
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:32,786
are primarily paid out of the General Fund but spend some portion of

229
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:36,482
their time working on development related activities that support the

230
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:40,146
Special Revenue Fund. Their activities are reimbursed to

231
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:44,226
the General Fund. The General Fund revenue is projected to increase by

232
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:47,366
77,000 or 5.5% from the

233
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:51,314
FY 22 estimate. Moving on to the special revenue

234
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:55,078
fund. This is Planning and Development special revenue fund dedicated to

235
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:58,620
the department's development related services.

236
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,854
These are services as a regulator to ensure orderly development

237
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,934
in the city and our extraterritorial jurisdiction. They include

238
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:10,934
functions such as the review of Platts, residential site plans and development

239
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:14,414
plats, including work with the Planning Commission as well as our site plan

240
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:18,366
review at the Houston Permitting Center. The Special Revenue Fund is funded with

241
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:22,014
revenue from fees associated with these reviews and dedicates that revenue for

242
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:25,986
services in support of development activity. A portion of

243
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,554
that revenue is received by the Special Revenue Fund is due to

244
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:33,282
team members who are primarily paid out of Special Revenue Fund but spend

245
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:37,074
some portion of their time working on community engagement, transportation, planning efforts

246
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:40,710
and management customer support activities that are technically General

247
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,246
Fund. We expect a slight decrease in the revenue of

248
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:48,140
43,000 or 4%

249
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,762
4% of this fund compared to FY 22

250
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:59,002
for fluctuations in revenue from various other sources. The next

251
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:02,586
line shows Central Services revolving fund, also known as the Enterprise

252
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:05,710
GIS. The fund provides critical mapping services

253
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,834
to the city, including creation and maintenance of the city's underlying

254
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:13,262
mapping data. The fund receives revenue from departments across

255
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:16,994
the city to pay for GIS related services. The revenue to this fund

256
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:20,258
is based on actual expenditures and as a result the

257
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:23,314
revenue can go up or down depending on vacancies in the fund or other cost

258
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:28,070
saving measures. This fund is expected to see a revenue increase of 107,000

259
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,146
or 6.6% and the final fund is the Historic

260
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:35,266
Preservation Fund. It was created by ordinance and is funded

261
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:38,646
through the proceeds from the sale of historic fire stations. The purpose

262
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:43,210
of this fund is to promote preservation and enhancement of the city's historic resources.

263
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,342
The revenue to It is simply interest on the Fund balance and we're anticipating

264
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:51,294
a 17% decrease in revenues this year.

265
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:55,310
Overall, department revenues increase 139,000

266
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,830
for all funds.

267
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,494
Shifting to Expenditures this slide is an overview of the FY

268
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:06,034
2023 budgeted budget in

269
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:09,454
comparison to the FY 22 projected current budget.

270
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:18,230
Overall, we're proposing an expenditure decrease of approximately 1,546,000

271
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,554
across all funds. Is that correct? The slide

272
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:23,750
provides a quick overview of expenditures.

273
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,810
General Fund we're proposing an increase of 14,000, or 0.4%.

274
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,340
The increase is largely due to hope.

275
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,786
To the Hope increase, Special Revenue Fund is proposed to

276
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:40,430
have a decrease of 1,629,000

277
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,026
or 12.1% resulting in a decrease

278
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:47,786
from Indirect Cost and Consulting Services and Central

279
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:52,130
Services Revolving Fund proposing an increase of 69,000 or 4.1%

280
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,970
resulting from Hope and increases in interfund charges. Finally,

281
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,340
the Historic Preservation Fund has no change.

282
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,160
This is the General Fund breakdown of expenditures.

283
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,704
Personnel versus non personnel approximately 3.9

284
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:14,604
million in expenditures which includes 77% for personnel

285
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:18,404
costs and 23% for non personnel cost in

286
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:22,628
the non personal expenditures. The 887,000

287
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:26,672
non personnel expenditure cost for the General Fund is broken

288
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:30,544
down. The largest category is the restricted accounts.

289
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:34,536
These expenses are not controlled by the Department and make up 97% of

290
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,928
the non personnel cost of this fund and then services

291
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:41,428
and supplies about 33,000 or 3% of the non

292
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:42,920
personnel expenditures.

293
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,824
Next slide. This slide illustrates the projected budget expenditures

294
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:52,104
for the Special Revenue Fund. The Fund's approximate 11

295
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:55,944
million in expenditures includes 57% for personnel

296
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:59,088
costs and 43% for non personnel cost

297
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:03,152
in FY 23. The nonpersonal cost for the Department's Special Revenue Fund

298
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:07,280
is as follows indirect cost recovery is 8%

299
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,168
or 411,000. This cost is for indirect

300
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:15,488
services provided by Central services departments and is not controlled by the Department.

301
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:19,216
Interfund Services 29% is the chargeback

302
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:23,320
that's paid to General Fund for development related activities that I mentioned earlier.

303
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,796
Plat Tracker and Historic Tracker web Application Redesign

304
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:31,144
I want to point out that this is a major expense this fund will see

305
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:35,004
for the next several years. Plat Tracker, which is the primary portal through

306
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:38,972
which all development related applications are submitted, is close to ten years

307
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:42,956
old and is built on 13 year old technology. We've been

308
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:46,924
working closely with It and Special Purchase and Strategic Purchasing

309
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,224
for two years to develop an RFP for the reconstruction of

310
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:54,016
this portal later this summer in June, you'll see

311
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:57,660
a contract on your agenda to actually begin rebuilding

312
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,436
this application. The restricted

313
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:05,516
accounts is 17% of the non personnel cost and is not controlled by the Department

314
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:09,656
and supplies and services is a combined 8% for

315
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:14,360
supplies and services, computer supplies and so forth. Next slide

316
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,124
the breakdown of the FY 23 expenditures for Central Services revolving

317
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:22,840
fund. The fund's approximately 1.7 million

318
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,764
in expenditures includes 86% for personnel cost and

319
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:30,156
14% for non personnel costs in

320
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:33,580
FY 23. The non personnel costs for the fund are broken down.

321
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,256
49% includes various services and charges related

322
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:40,320
to the fund, including technology, services and software.

323
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,896
And then 40% of the non personnel cost in this fund is not controlled by

324
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:47,780
the Department. Those are restricted accounts. And finally,

325
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,820
11% is for computer supplies, offices,

326
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,656
et cetera. Next slide. The breakdown

327
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:58,100
of the proposed FY 23 expenditures for the Historic Preservation Fund

328
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,636
include approximately 150,000 in

329
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:04,632
expenditures and is entirely for non personnel cost.

330
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:07,656
There are no FTEs paid for out of this fund.

331
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:11,124
The nonpersonal cost includes miscellaneous

332
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:14,508
support services, which include funding for translation services for

333
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:17,976
the Historic Commission meetings and the completion of the design guidelines

334
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:20,060
for the historic areas in Houston.

335
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,180
This slide shows our FY 23 projected fund balance

336
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,540
I'm sorry projected General Fund budget expenditures

337
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,192
net change to our FY 2022 projected current

338
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:37,776
budget. The FY 23 projected current budget is

339
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,156
3.9 million. There's a one time operating budget adjustment for

340
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:44,804
the position that was funded in FY 22 for the Office of Resilience and

341
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:48,384
Sustainability that our Ara will now fund contractual

342
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,776
or mandated adjustments of 115,000 that

343
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:55,396
consist of the municipal pension reduction and an increase in the restricted

344
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:59,236
accounts and hope pay increases resulting in an operating program increase

345
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:03,164
of 15,000. This brings our FY 2023

346
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:07,390
projected budget to 3.9 million or an increase of 0.4%.

347
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,888
Any questions? Thank you for your presentation,

348
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:16,744
council Member Alcorn. Thank you Chair.

349
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:20,492
And thank you, Director, for all the great work you do at the Planning Department.

350
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:23,916
Thanks for talking about Plat tracker. I was going to ask about the increase

351
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:27,648
in management. I guess it's under the

352
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:31,904
management consulting services. That's the big thing. And I know we we budgeted

353
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:36,324
last year $2.6 million in that line item and spent $300,000.

354
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:40,564
Can you just talk to me about that? Was it just delayed or

355
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:43,704
were we expecting to spend that last year or what have you? We did expect

356
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:47,450
to spend it last year, so about two years ago we started working with it

357
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,632
on looking at how can we fix what we have because it is old,

358
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:56,216
so let's just fix it. And it's answer was

359
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:59,884
we really can't fix it. We need to really start from scratch. And so we

360
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:03,276
expected it to be a shorter time frame in order to do the RFP and

361
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,944
to get the money spent for rebuilding it. It actually took longer

362
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:10,592
because we were more detailed. We went through a

363
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:14,556
very robust conversation with the bidders

364
00:23:14,588 --> 00:23:18,860
on this and have developed an incredibly secure

365
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,788
program that it supports that we're going to move forward with.

366
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:26,164
The 300,000 that was spent last year was actually what

367
00:23:26,202 --> 00:23:29,552
led us to such a good resolution in that we had a contract

368
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:33,744
with Gartner and Company to help us actually draft the RFP

369
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:37,656
got it. And since they didn't bid on it and so that's like a

370
00:23:37,678 --> 00:23:40,936
lesser expense, the $1.9 million in the 2.6, do we expect

371
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:44,068
there to be more in coming years towards this you said this will be a

372
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:47,948
major expense for it'll be an expense for at least seven years.

373
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:51,484
It is a one year implementation project with six years of

374
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:55,276
full, virtually 24 hours support for

375
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:58,400
our customers and for our staff. So we're very pleased with this process.

376
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,836
Okay. And I've got some other questions about the primarily

377
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:05,328
around the planning and development special revenue fund. You mentioned

378
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:09,716
that some of the general fund employees support the

379
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:13,364
efforts of that and vice versa. Some of the

380
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:17,344
employees that are paid for through the Planning and Development Special Revenue

381
00:24:17,392 --> 00:24:20,576
Fund also do general fund functions and vice

382
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:24,008
versa. Okay. I guess my question is,

383
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:27,864
was that the intent of putting the I mean, was it was it all

384
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:31,636
was it supposed to be the Planning and Development Special Revenue Fund over at permitting

385
00:24:31,748 --> 00:24:35,148
was supposed to just support those efforts, or was it always meant to

386
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:38,732
be fluid? Well, so when the fund

387
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:42,632
was created so the fees

388
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:45,984
are for land development activities that the City

389
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:49,692
of Houston does, whether it's Platting or permitting over at the permitting

390
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:53,212
center. So the fund supports

391
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:57,404
those activities, but it also supports some development related

392
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,976
activities, such as a few positions that do minimum

393
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:04,176
lot size designations, because those are development related.

394
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:08,308
It supports some of our transportation planning. And as we have

395
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:12,084
worked with this fund for three years, what we've been able to determine

396
00:25:12,132 --> 00:25:16,104
is that some team members specialties really afford them.

397
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:20,216
They have the best skills and the best ability to do a

398
00:25:20,238 --> 00:25:23,964
type of service such as outreach. Some of that outreach will

399
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:27,528
be development related, some of it won't be. And so that's

400
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:30,936
why we charge back and reimburse

401
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:34,316
the funds, is because if, say, for instance, one of our

402
00:25:34,338 --> 00:25:36,540
planners is terrific at outreach,

403
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,728
she will work with the development side work as

404
00:25:40,754 --> 00:25:44,096
well as the non development side. And we need to make sure we're clear on

405
00:25:44,118 --> 00:25:47,372
which fund pays her. Okay, I have some more if you put me back in.

406
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:51,204
Did I answer your question? Yes. Okay, let's be mindful. We're about

407
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:53,460
45 minutes behind schedule.

408
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,260
Council Member Cayman,

409
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,170
I'm happy to defer to Council Member Alcorn if she wants to wrap up.

410
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,864
All right, Director, first off,

411
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:15,696
I know you all are dealing with a lot right now. And then on top

412
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:17,520
of that, to throw in redistricting.

413
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,236
I don't know how you all are doing it all, but thank you. And again.

414
00:26:23,418 --> 00:26:26,628
David Fields. So many others. I'm not

415
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:29,956
going to start naming people because I'll get in trouble. But whether it's in

416
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:34,040
District C, the Historic districts, the Heritage District,

417
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,744
Vision Zero's Implementation, I'm so excited to hear about the new

418
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:41,832
freight mapping. I think that's going to be a very big deal,

419
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:45,816
especially in District C. On top of

420
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:49,656
all of that, any meeting my constituents have asked for, you and your staff

421
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:53,244
have been to. So thank you for being available to

422
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:56,812
our residents for all of their questions. In times of great

423
00:26:56,866 --> 00:27:00,816
concern and need. One of the concerns I just want to continue to

424
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:04,144
raise and elevate in any way that I can. I know as a city

425
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:08,524
we have to build denser, we have to have affordable

426
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:12,416
housing, we have to make it convenient for people in parts

427
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:15,812
of the district. I continue to be concerned about, for example,

428
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:19,808
in Shady Acres, in Lazy Brook Timbergrove, but especially Shady Acres

429
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:23,388
that as we're building hyper densely,

430
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:26,664
we still don't have the infrastructure to mitigate and

431
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:30,596
manage all of the building that's going on. So I know that's

432
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:34,156
not a question. I just, on behalf of residents, have to continue to

433
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:38,088
emphasize the need to as we build dense

434
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:42,380
that we're building responsibly. And I know you take that charge very seriously

435
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,724
as it relates to the department itself.

436
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:49,456
May I respond to that for a moment? We do take it very seriously and

437
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:52,832
I think that our Livable Places Action Committee is working very

438
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:56,176
hard and very intently on fixing some of that. But I

439
00:27:56,198 --> 00:27:59,780
also want to say that our partnership with the Houston Public Works

440
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,536
Department is better than it has ever been. And so the work that we're

441
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:07,684
doing with development and developers and property owners in

442
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:11,096
the city is really being amplified by the work that

443
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:15,956
they're doing in the general I'm sorry, in the Chief

444
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:20,116
Engineer's office. And the partnership is really putting forth ideas

445
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:23,932
for a better Houston and I couldn't agree more.

446
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:28,536
So, again, I appreciate that and really look forward to the additional measures

447
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:30,910
and improvements as they come along really quickly.

448
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,420
Future needs of the department. Again, tight budget,

449
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,956
what do we need to be on the lookout for or be aware of that's

450
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:42,272
not being satisfied by this current budget this year.

451
00:28:42,406 --> 00:28:46,352
So we anticipate future needs of the department include, besides special

452
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:50,150
revenue fund activities, some general fund activities that could be

453
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,688
that conservation District working with the Conservation District

454
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:58,164
is a new program we're creating this year. We also would like to do

455
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:01,524
more resiliency plans for neighborhoods that would take more

456
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:05,176
team members. And we believe that the tools we have

457
00:29:05,198 --> 00:29:08,570
in place, such as minimum lot size and minimum building line, are very

458
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,696
good for neighborhoods and they very much want to opt into them.

459
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,460
Having the number of people who can support that has been difficult recently.

460
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,870
Council Member Alcorn, as you mentioned, Director, you have

461
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,152
really increased the number of plans you're reviewing over at the permitting center.

462
00:29:26,226 --> 00:29:29,488
So I noticed in your budget, it looks like going to

463
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:33,888
get two more FTEs in development design review,

464
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:37,440
one more in development services, three more in development support

465
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,696
services. Do you think that that's sufficient to I noticed in today's

466
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:45,696
dashboard you've got about 1900 plans in planning

467
00:29:45,728 --> 00:29:49,572
at about 27 days. I know you're working towards a goal of 13 days

468
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:52,904
for commercial, ten days for residential. So do you think you

469
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:56,952
need more people there to tackle the great number of increase in

470
00:29:57,006 --> 00:30:00,410
plans. I think that right now we are seeing

471
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,040
such an immense increase in the plans that, yes,

472
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,916
right now I could use double the team, but I

473
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:12,264
have to be really cautious because the Special Revenue Fund is a self fulfilling

474
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:16,012
fund. It is not like right. Not like the general fund. It comes

475
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:20,656
from the fees that we collect and we

476
00:30:20,678 --> 00:30:23,776
have this huge expense for Plat tracker. And so as that

477
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:28,112
works its way out to you for approval over the next month,

478
00:30:28,246 --> 00:30:31,552
once I get that number nailed down, I'll be able to analyze

479
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:36,272
where I can go and how I can increase funding at a much more safe

480
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:39,700
way. So that's when I'll take that step. Does your department offer

481
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,028
customer paid expediting? Yes, we do expedite.

482
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,770
Can you describe that to me a little bit?

483
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,636
So if a customer asks

484
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:53,144
for expedited review and pays it by

485
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:56,600
09:00 a.m. That morning, I believe

486
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,076
we have the plan out for them within 24

487
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:03,292
hours of the 24 hours from the time they pay the fee, I believe.

488
00:31:03,346 --> 00:31:06,636
Does the charge depend on the complexity of the project or

489
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:09,568
is it a flat? Council Member, can I get back to you? Sure, absolutely.

490
00:31:09,654 --> 00:31:10,770
Thank you very much.

491
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,660
Thank you, Director and Mr. Hamilton for your presentation.

492
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,356
You all are now dismissed. Thank you. We will now begin

493
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:23,060
the public comment period. We will start with our virtual speakers.

494
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,976
Please press star six to unmute when you hear your name. The first speaker

495
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:30,132
is Saba Blandy. Hey,

496
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:34,120
good afternoon. I just had two quick questions for this department.

497
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,116
I appreciate the expansion to the High Comfort Bicycle Network,

498
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:41,610
and I was curious what the overall timeline of expansion was.

499
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,228
And I was also curious, as somebody who lives near a

500
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:49,100
bus stop, if there's a plan to make sidewalks near public transit

501
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,670
Ada accessible, because the ones near ours are not.

502
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,236
So we'll need to get back

503
00:31:58,258 --> 00:32:01,536
to you on question one. So if you want to send that to District E

504
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:04,880
at houstontx Gov, we'll get you a specific response on that.

505
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,576
As it pertains to question two? As it

506
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:11,732
pertains to question two, yes, I believe there is

507
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:15,440
a strategy in place to provide sidewalks and Ada

508
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,604
accessibility for Metro bus stops in those

509
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:23,272
areas. And there are some plans that are in the works

510
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:27,032
that our offices are collaborating with Metro. I know

511
00:32:27,086 --> 00:32:31,460
in District J we did a recent initiative with Metro

512
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,736
regarding our bus stops, and they were very intentional on finding

513
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:39,736
bus stops with proper sidewalks and Ada accessibility.

514
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:43,112
So that is on our radar.

515
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:46,716
That is a priority for us to continue to look at and be able to

516
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:51,296
be mindful to try to get as many bus stops up

517
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:55,184
to date with those type of amenities as possible around the city.

518
00:32:55,302 --> 00:32:58,988
So if you see one in your area, wherever you are in your district,

519
00:32:59,084 --> 00:33:02,480
try to advocate for that. Reach out to your district. Council Member

520
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,532
and stay engaged with us. Absolutely. Thank you.

521
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:09,696
Council Member David Robinson. Thank you, Chair, and Ms. Blanding,

522
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:13,284
thank you again for being here so alertly

523
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:17,236
with our panels. And in this case, I think I'd

524
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:20,456
like to call your attention to the city's website for

525
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,020
the TTI committee briefings. Recently, there has been

526
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,564
a presentation, yes, by planning, but also in

527
00:33:27,602 --> 00:33:31,368
conjunction with the Mayor's Office for persons with disabilities. Director Gabe

528
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,716
Costarez has addressed some of those things. And I

529
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:38,032
think that the video recording of that

530
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:42,224
you would find interesting and perhaps helpful. And if you need a reference to

531
00:33:42,342 --> 00:33:46,124
where within the presentation that content occurred,

532
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:50,196
my office can help you. If you reach out to the AtLarge two office for

533
00:33:50,218 --> 00:33:54,180
that. So I appreciate the good questions and your ongoing attendance.

534
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,390
Thank you so much.

535
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,340

537
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,650
Amanda Sigh, please press star six to unmute.

538
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,900
Hello.

539
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm not prepared right now, so I'll go ahead and yield my time.

540
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,270
Mr. Jason oliver.

541
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,058
Hello, and thank you to the Planning Department for

542
00:34:42,224 --> 00:34:45,786
the Redistricting website is really valuable. It has

543
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:49,278
a lot of resources. It's been helpful for me trying to understand

544
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:53,066
this and the language accessibility there. I'm wondering

545
00:34:53,098 --> 00:34:56,926
if there's a centralized online place where the CIP kind

546
00:34:56,948 --> 00:35:01,050
of information is being shared during these meetings are all accessible.

547
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,914
That's a whole separate budget adoption. That's much

548
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:08,254
hard to navigate. And I feel like it's kind of falling under the radar

549
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:11,310
with all that's happening with Redistricting.

550
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,802
And then second, as the city transitions to outcomes based

551
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:18,774
budgeting, the Finance Department told us that planning would be the group

552
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:21,974
to facilitate public engagement around it. So what

553
00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:25,346
existing plans are in action and how can we enhance the budget

554
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:29,290
process to encourage engagement? For example, holding workshops before

555
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,210
the proposed budget is released and extending the timeline so that there's more opportunity

556
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,060
and it's not kind of rushed in the way that it is now.

557
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:41,086
Council Member David Robinson. Yes. Mr. Oliver, thanks again for your good

558
00:35:41,108 --> 00:35:45,070
question. I think with regard to the activities of the CIP

559
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,066
programs, we have the last meeting tonight. As I'm sure you're

560
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:52,618
aware, the District B office and

561
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:55,582
our District B meeting is this evening.

562
00:35:55,726 --> 00:35:59,950
But I think your question is a good one to get all of those activities

563
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,746
consolidated in a place on the web. So I'm interested in

564
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:07,606
following up with you. Of course, that relates to activities, as you said,

565
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:11,558
central to the Finance Department as well as to public works.

566
00:36:11,724 --> 00:36:14,802
So to have some kind of centralized location

567
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:18,298
for that CIP information, let's see what we can do to

568
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,830
help you on that one. Okay. And additionally jason.

569
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,322
Thank you. We are working to schedule our

570
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:28,550
CIP special call BFA meeting in June.

571
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,586
So after we go through the budget presentations as a

572
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:36,362
committee, we will take up the CIP and present that to the public

573
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:40,238
so you can stay engaged with the process through that way as well. So we'll

574
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:43,250
put the information out on that shortly.

575
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,370
Thank you. That completes our public

576
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:48,830
speakers.
