WEBVTT

00:00.170 --> 00:03.866
Department workshop. We will now adjourn the Housing Department budget

00:03.898 --> 00:07.498
workshop and begin our budget workshop for the Houston Public Library.

00:07.594 --> 00:08.800
Thank you very much.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.200
Oh,

00:57.680 --> 00:59.950
hello. Are you ready?

01:02.160 --> 01:05.784
Yes, ma'am. At this time, I would like to welcome Director RIA Brown Lawson

01:05.832 --> 01:11.184
and hope to

01:11.222 --> 01:14.320
provide the Houston Public Library budget presentation.

01:15.060 --> 01:18.000
The floor is yours. Thank you. And hello,

01:18.070 --> 01:22.188
everybody. Thank you for the opportunity to present

01:22.374 --> 01:25.536
the Houston Public Library's proposed budget for fiscal

01:25.568 --> 01:28.660
year 2023. Before I begin,

01:28.730 --> 01:32.244
I'd like to take advantage of this opportunity to

01:32.282 --> 01:36.260
publicly thank and acknowledge the members of the Houston Public Library

01:36.340 --> 01:40.472
Executive Leadership Team and other

01:40.526 --> 01:43.770
staff who are responsible for

01:44.380 --> 01:47.964
helping the library to be one of the

01:48.002 --> 01:50.764
best library systems in the country.

01:50.962 --> 01:54.156
So I'd like to publicly thank and acknowledge all

01:54.178 --> 01:57.784
those members of the executive team. It is my honor

01:57.832 --> 02:01.632
and privilege to work with a team of professionals with such

02:01.686 --> 02:05.612
an array of talent, innovativeness creativity, and deep commitment

02:05.676 --> 02:09.072
to provide equitable services to the residents of our great

02:09.126 --> 02:13.140
city. I would also like to thank and acknowledge the Houston Public

02:13.210 --> 02:16.996
Library Foundation for their unwavering support of the

02:17.018 --> 02:21.140
library and their support of the library's programs.

02:21.640 --> 02:25.392
Joining me today for the presentation is the Library

02:25.456 --> 02:29.104
Department's chief Financial officer and Assistant

02:29.152 --> 02:32.232
Director Hope Wabakesee. With that,

02:32.286 --> 02:35.428
I will now present our proposed FY.

02:35.524 --> 02:39.164
And if you would come a little closer to the microphone. Absolutely.

02:39.282 --> 02:40.940
Is that better? Yes, ma'am.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.964
Okay. Slide two presents the library's functional organizational

02:49.032 --> 02:53.984
chart. The chart shows the distribution of

02:54.022 --> 02:57.628
the proposed FY 23 budget and FTEs

02:57.724 --> 03:00.720
within the six divisions of the library.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.160
Next slide.

03:06.340 --> 03:10.032
Slide three outlines departmental

03:10.096 --> 03:13.590
programming and considerations relative to major services,

03:14.060 --> 03:18.040
statutory requirements, and the financial impact

03:18.380 --> 03:21.976
on service delivery regarding services

03:22.078 --> 03:25.448
and programs. The library remains committed to

03:25.454 --> 03:29.612
the delivery of equitable quality services and resources in

03:29.666 --> 03:33.756
multiple formats to all residents of Houston through

03:33.778 --> 03:37.484
the department's network of 38 libraries embedded in

03:37.522 --> 03:40.992
neighborhoods throughout the city, the mobile lab

03:41.126 --> 03:44.780
and three history research collections

03:44.940 --> 03:46.720
and the Central Library.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.200
Next slide.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.880
I'm sorry. Same slide. Also in high demand

03:56.960 --> 04:00.816
are resources for small businesses, new entrepreneurs

04:00.848 --> 04:04.772
and job seekers. The library's network of 38 locations

04:04.836 --> 04:08.212
throughout the city also service critical community hubs,

04:08.276 --> 04:12.088
which include two technic facilities, three history

04:12.174 --> 04:15.336
research centers of Texas history,

04:15.438 --> 04:19.000
african American history and genealogical resources,

04:19.160 --> 04:22.584
with over 193 print volumes,

04:22.712 --> 04:26.824
2500 archival and or history collections,

04:26.872 --> 04:32.112
and 320 microform resources per

04:32.166 --> 04:35.820
state law. In terms of statutory

04:35.980 --> 04:40.000
requirements per the state law,

04:40.150 --> 04:43.264
the Texas State Library and Archives Commission,

04:43.392 --> 04:47.556
or Tslac, sets the standards and requirements for

04:47.578 --> 04:50.710
the accreditation of libraries throughout the state.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.300
State accreditation eligibility requires a per

04:55.370 --> 04:58.316
capita of 17 dollarsfifty,

04:58.368 --> 05:02.132
cents and at least one item of library

05:02.196 --> 05:06.084
materials per capita. The libraries

05:06.132 --> 05:09.772
per capita for the state FY 21

05:09.826 --> 05:12.510
annual report was 16.90.

05:13.440 --> 05:17.048
To fill the gap, HPL submitted

05:17.224 --> 05:21.360
supplemental maintenance and security dollars from GST

05:21.860 --> 05:26.012
for the last two years as part of the support for library

05:26.076 --> 05:30.412
operations to help meet the Tslac accreditation

05:30.556 --> 05:34.180
requirements. With the budget increase this year,

05:34.250 --> 05:38.452
we should be poised to meet state accreditation standards during

05:38.506 --> 05:40.900
the next reporting period.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.728
Financial or societal impact of the City service

05:46.814 --> 05:51.512
delivery includes 1.4

05:51.566 --> 05:55.096
million cardholders have access to 3 million

05:55.198 --> 05:59.052
print and digital resources. In a world where

05:59.106 --> 06:02.936
having technological access is a basic necessity,

06:03.128 --> 06:06.264
the library is the largest provider of free Internet

06:06.312 --> 06:10.604
access in the region. Through their neighborhood libraries,

06:10.652 --> 06:13.612
Houston residents have access to WiFi,

06:13.756 --> 06:17.040
hotspots, tablets and computers.

06:17.620 --> 06:21.392
According to the Texas State Library, for every one

06:21.446 --> 06:25.472
dollars invested in public libraries in Texas,

06:25.616 --> 06:28.800
the community sees a return of approximately

06:28.880 --> 06:29.910
$5.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.980
Anticipated growth or reduction of population served

06:37.140 --> 06:41.444
in FY 23.8 million people utilize the library

06:41.492 --> 06:43.690
in person or via the website.

06:44.300 --> 06:48.300
With Houston's growth in current user demand requiring more

06:48.450 --> 06:52.220
robust Eservices and programs, we have seen

06:52.290 --> 06:55.150
marked increase in digital services,

06:55.600 --> 06:59.344
which is up currently. 28% from

06:59.382 --> 07:02.672
FY 2020 database use

07:02.726 --> 07:06.496
increased 41% last year, especially the

07:06.518 --> 07:09.970
use of Linda.com, where users access

07:10.980 --> 07:14.208
instructive videos to build creativity

07:14.304 --> 07:18.580
and business skills to achieve personal and professional goals.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.356
This increased demand is particularly impactful to

07:22.378 --> 07:26.404
the department's budget, as databases and electronic

07:26.452 --> 07:30.104
resources are very much more costly than

07:30.142 --> 07:37.052
print materials. Slide Four this

07:37.106 --> 07:40.360
slide provides an overview of the department's revenues

07:40.440 --> 07:44.156
from FY 21 actual to FY 23

07:44.258 --> 07:47.996
anticipated revenues. The library is not a

07:48.018 --> 07:51.916
revenue generating department, but it does contribute

07:51.948 --> 07:55.824
to the General Fund through passport Services and

07:55.862 --> 08:00.080
the central library parking garage.

08:00.660 --> 08:04.624
The Historic Preservation Fund generates revenue for the Julia

08:04.672 --> 08:08.324
Addison Building, which is used to support the

08:08.362 --> 08:12.390
special maintenance that is required for this historic building.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.124
The special revenue fund is associated with the Mayor's

08:17.172 --> 08:19.640
Office for Adult Literacy.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.640
Next slide.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.580
Slide five provides revenue highlights.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.512
We anticipate returning to pre pandemic operations

08:33.576 --> 08:37.176
in FY 23, which will contribute to an increase

08:37.208 --> 08:41.040
in the revenue generated from the Passport services fees.

08:41.540 --> 08:45.036
The increase in facility rental fees is mainly

08:45.068 --> 08:48.892
due to the Frenchies restaurant rental for Smith Library

08:48.956 --> 08:53.224
parking. The grant transfer is a onetime

08:53.292 --> 08:57.104
FEMA insurance allocation to reimburse Kendall

08:57.152 --> 09:00.404
library books and materials that were lost due to

09:00.442 --> 09:01.860
Hurricane Harvey.

09:03.660 --> 09:07.064
Next slide the

09:07.102 --> 09:10.532
library's expenditures for FY 23 reflect

09:10.596 --> 09:14.632
an increase of 13.7% based

09:14.686 --> 09:18.328
on mandatory salary and benefit increases

09:18.504 --> 09:21.660
and an increase in the books and materials budget.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.784
The Historic Preservation Fund expenditures do not affect

09:25.832 --> 09:29.612
the General Fund as rental revenues cover expenditures

09:29.676 --> 09:33.452
for improvement in historical maintenance of the Julia Odds

09:33.516 --> 09:36.320
building. Next slide.

09:38.500 --> 09:42.052
Slide seven outlines the FY 2023

09:42.106 --> 09:46.164
expenditure highlights. For personnel services, there was

09:46.202 --> 09:49.312
a 3% hope increase fringe benefit

09:49.376 --> 09:53.120
increase minimum wage increase, an additional

09:53.200 --> 09:56.736
29 positions for staff two

09:56.778 --> 10:00.072
staff, two new library buildings, a leaf and Dr.

10:00.126 --> 10:04.120
Shannon Walker and the Kendall Renovated library.

10:04.940 --> 10:08.620
FY 23 will be the first time in several years

10:08.690 --> 10:12.140
that we will have all HPL locations open

10:12.290 --> 10:16.700
and fully operational, requiring an increase in staffing.

10:17.440 --> 10:20.592
The increase in supplies and services will be used

10:20.646 --> 10:24.060
in the libraries just mentioned. The budget

10:24.140 --> 10:28.320
also reflects an increase in the restricted accounts.

10:28.660 --> 10:32.224
The 1.7 million increase in books and materials

10:32.272 --> 10:35.872
relates back to the one time FEMA insurance allocation

10:35.936 --> 10:40.064
that covers Kindle library books and materials, an improved

10:40.112 --> 10:43.280
increase of 1 million that would allow HPL

10:43.360 --> 10:47.480
to meet the Texas State Library accreditation standards.

10:48.460 --> 10:52.532
Next slide. The primary

10:52.596 --> 10:56.184
drivers in library expenses are personnel and

10:56.222 --> 10:59.816
materials. Personnel expenses for the

10:59.838 --> 11:03.432
library represents 72% of our total budget,

11:03.576 --> 11:07.756
and the nonpersonal budget is 28% of

11:07.778 --> 11:11.964
the nonpersonal budget. Non capital books and materials represent

11:12.012 --> 11:14.924
46%, restricted accounts,

11:14.972 --> 11:19.360
25%. Services represent 22%,

11:19.510 --> 11:23.110
and supplies represent 2%.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.972
Next slide. Slide nine

11:28.026 --> 11:31.972
shows our operating budget of 30.4

11:32.026 --> 11:35.480
million, with restricted accounts totaling

11:35.980 --> 11:39.716
13.6 million. The contracted

11:39.748 --> 11:43.290
and mandated adjustments total 1.5 million.

11:44.060 --> 11:51.950
Our proposed FY 23 budget is 50,000,000.342,

11:52.320 --> 11:56.110
which reflects a change of 14.1%.

11:58.900 --> 12:02.284
Next slide. The chart

12:02.332 --> 12:05.664
on slide ten represents the library's history of

12:05.702 --> 12:10.000
being good stewards of the allocated funds the department receives.

12:13.790 --> 12:17.834
Next slide. This concludes my

12:17.872 --> 12:21.194
formal presentation, and I'd like to point out that the

12:21.232 --> 12:25.882
appendix contains the library's workplace analysis,

12:25.946 --> 12:29.086
including staff numbers and demographic information,

12:29.268 --> 12:32.878
departmental accomplishments for FY 22,

12:33.044 --> 12:36.334
and restricted account details. I'm happy

12:36.372 --> 12:38.960
to answer any questions that you may have.

12:39.970 --> 12:43.170
Thank you, Director, for your presentation. We will now take questions

12:43.240 --> 12:46.686
from council members who will each receive two minutes per the normal committee

12:46.718 --> 12:50.510
rules. First in the queue is vice mayor pro TEM martha castex tate.

12:50.670 --> 12:54.290
Director Lawson, thank you for your presentation. You know, I love the library

12:54.370 --> 12:57.382
and all that you all stand for, and all that we do in the city

12:57.436 --> 13:01.234
of Houston, especially around adult literacy. Super excited

13:01.282 --> 13:04.602
about the Dr. Shannon Walker Library coming to District K

13:04.656 --> 13:08.714
soon. Based on your stat on

13:08.752 --> 13:12.982
page three, we should see a big return in societal

13:13.046 --> 13:17.054
impact in District K with the new

13:17.092 --> 13:20.318
library coming on board. But my question is,

13:20.484 --> 13:23.966
can you talk a little bit about the revenues from the

13:23.988 --> 13:27.626
passport services as we look at our budget and

13:27.668 --> 13:30.786
how we can increase revenues in the city? I was intrigued at

13:30.808 --> 13:34.462
our meeting that we have four or five passport

13:34.526 --> 13:36.370
offices in libraries.

13:37.430 --> 13:41.480
I'd be happy to pre pandemic. We were

13:42.570 --> 13:46.594
providing million dollars worth of passport

13:46.642 --> 13:49.682
services through the city, through five locations.

13:49.826 --> 13:53.722
Five locations? Yes, and we

13:53.776 --> 13:57.626
anticipate they're very popular. Let me just say

13:57.808 --> 14:00.954
we're better than the post office. You can quote me on that.

14:01.152 --> 14:06.506
And we have many people complimenting

14:06.538 --> 14:09.646
our staff on the process, so they like

14:09.668 --> 14:13.070
to use the library, and during our

14:13.140 --> 14:16.458
discussion council Member you're wondering why we don't

14:16.474 --> 14:19.842
do it in more locations and generate more money.

14:19.976 --> 14:23.570
And our conversation accounted with.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.834
Well, if we do more locations, maybe the library can keep half

14:26.872 --> 14:30.754
and the city can get half. So a million apiece.

14:30.882 --> 14:32.550
We'll do ten locations.

14:33.450 --> 14:34.200
Okay.

14:37.050 --> 14:41.090
Would you need additional staff? If we put five more passport

14:41.170 --> 14:45.166
offices in five libraries, will we need additional staff,

14:45.218 --> 14:48.746
or would staff be able to cover that, will we be able to see

14:48.848 --> 14:52.982
a bigger gain, or would we need to actually hire additional

14:53.046 --> 14:57.066
staff for that running of five additional passport offices?

14:57.178 --> 15:01.146
I think we would definitely need more staff.

15:01.338 --> 15:05.486
We did five more locations. We'd need at

15:05.508 --> 15:09.506
least five more staff members, but they would pay for themselves with a

15:09.528 --> 15:13.662
million dollar five passport offices.

15:13.726 --> 15:17.380
We've generated a million dollars through

15:17.910 --> 15:20.580
the revenues we have.

15:20.890 --> 15:24.198
Okay. And that money went back to the general fund and not to the

15:24.204 --> 15:27.750
library. Every cent went back to the general

15:27.820 --> 15:31.442
fund. Okay. Council Member Robinson.

15:31.586 --> 15:34.726
Thank you. Chair and Director, thank you so much for all you

15:34.748 --> 15:38.282
do with such limited number of staff. It's really,

15:38.336 --> 15:42.282
truly remarkable. So I want to thank your team personally for that. And of course,

15:42.336 --> 15:46.550
you and I are also working on what we hope will be a map archive

15:46.630 --> 15:50.106
for the Julietison Library downtown. So referring

15:50.138 --> 15:53.614
to that same chart of revenues that the Vice Mayor Pro

15:53.652 --> 15:57.310
TEM referred to on page four, that category of special

15:57.380 --> 16:01.298
revenue fund, while we're talking about it and thinking in particular

16:01.384 --> 16:05.218
about the Julia Idison I know it's come to my attention that that is

16:05.304 --> 16:10.002
the number one venue in what,

16:10.056 --> 16:14.118
the city for weddings. Help me with this director. We are

16:14.284 --> 16:18.150
rated on a national scale of being the top ten

16:18.220 --> 16:21.398
places for holding weddings. Yes.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.318
Okay, so that's top ten in the United States of America.

16:25.414 --> 16:28.970
Absolutely. Okay, so while we're talking about passports,

16:30.830 --> 16:34.570
let's talk about people getting married at libraries. I love that.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.542
Let's do that. Just for the record, I am a single

16:38.596 --> 16:42.750
man, but I know that's beside the point. We'll hold a spot.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.470
How much money you got? Says the vice member.

16:46.290 --> 16:50.194
Yeah. Another aside, but it does

16:50.232 --> 16:54.030
raise the question about potential

16:54.110 --> 16:57.554
revenue sources for our beautiful facilities. Because whether

16:57.592 --> 17:01.682
it's the new library that's going into District K, whether it's the incredible

17:01.746 --> 17:05.000
facility that's going into District F on the West Side,

17:05.610 --> 17:09.094
our flagship libraries that are

17:09.132 --> 17:12.982
downtown and the ones that we know are most used whether

17:13.036 --> 17:17.450
those funds go back into the general revenue fund or how else

17:17.600 --> 17:20.940
we categorize those revenues, I'd be really interested,

17:21.390 --> 17:25.058
because it strikes me that what we do, as Vice Mayor

17:25.094 --> 17:28.510
Pro TEM pointed out, for societal impacts,

17:29.090 --> 17:32.654
that is really something that you'd think

17:32.692 --> 17:36.586
could fuel some staffing and fuel some activities throughout

17:36.618 --> 17:40.450
the city. If you cared to comment, we'd love to hear from you.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.082
Sure. And we're really excited about all our

17:44.136 --> 17:47.778
historical buildings, and with the right

17:47.864 --> 17:51.414
amount of staff and promotion, we assure that

17:51.452 --> 17:55.270
we could generate even more activity around

17:55.340 --> 18:00.098
them. But you're

18:00.114 --> 18:03.546
only able to do that based on your capacity to

18:03.568 --> 18:07.338
do it. And so you would need, like, any other

18:07.504 --> 18:10.940
venue staffing around that.

18:14.270 --> 18:16.970
That would be the answer. Capacity is everything,

18:17.120 --> 18:20.666
right? And again, with the great resignation chair, that's going to be a challenge

18:20.698 --> 18:23.886
for this department. Like every other one we've heard from today, but thank you,

18:23.908 --> 18:27.578
director. You're welcome. Council member came in. Thank you,

18:27.684 --> 18:31.294
Dr. Lawson. First off, we love our libraries.

18:31.342 --> 18:34.946
Thank you to the entire team. Can you

18:34.968 --> 18:38.862
say it one more time? When it came to Internet,

18:38.926 --> 18:42.966
as a provider of Internet accessibility, did you say

18:42.988 --> 18:46.758
that our libraries are the largest provider in

18:46.764 --> 18:49.270
the region? In the region, yes.

18:49.420 --> 18:53.142
And given the digital

18:53.206 --> 18:56.506
divide that we saw during the

18:56.528 --> 19:00.074
Pandemic, especially with students and youth that did not

19:00.112 --> 19:03.850
have access to Internet, I'm assuming that those programs are continuing

19:05.010 --> 19:08.670
beyond the Pandemic. Oh, yes. What we did during the Pandemic

19:09.410 --> 19:12.954
was to install high powered

19:13.002 --> 19:17.402
antennas on several of our locations so that

19:17.556 --> 19:21.134
those families that did not have Internet

19:21.182 --> 19:25.182
access could, at least from our parking lots with libraries

19:25.246 --> 19:28.706
closed, have that kind of access.

19:28.808 --> 19:32.326
And some of them were strong enough to bleeding to the homes that

19:32.348 --> 19:35.682
were nearby. But broadband

19:35.826 --> 19:38.854
is a national issue, as we all

19:38.892 --> 19:42.680
know, and having access to

19:43.130 --> 19:46.582
the Internet is now like having electricity

19:46.646 --> 19:50.154
in your home. It's a necessity because if

19:50.192 --> 19:53.686
you don't have it, you are cut off from a lot of information that's

19:53.718 --> 19:57.142
needed. We see people using libraries

19:57.206 --> 20:00.534
to apply for jobs to hold. They rent

20:00.582 --> 20:04.366
out spaces so that they can hold job interviews, because most

20:04.468 --> 20:06.480
job interviews now are online.

20:08.390 --> 20:11.570
We see number

20:11.640 --> 20:15.154
of citizens borrowing hotspots so that they can

20:15.192 --> 20:18.654
take that hotspot into their home and have Internet

20:18.702 --> 20:21.942
access. All that we're doing,

20:21.996 --> 20:25.830
and we're doing a lot, it's a drop in the bucket for the whole

20:25.900 --> 20:29.110
conversation around broadband and its necessity.

20:29.850 --> 20:32.838
Maybe place back in queue. Go ahead.

20:33.004 --> 20:36.630
Thank you, and I appreciate that. And all the efforts

20:36.710 --> 20:40.106
to confirm all of the libraries are now

20:40.208 --> 20:44.394
back up and running that were prior to the Pandemic. So they're open for

20:44.432 --> 20:47.886
all. And I'm asking because we're coming up on Summer, where our

20:47.908 --> 20:51.006
libraries again play that really important role out of

20:51.028 --> 20:56.506
school to keep children sharp

20:56.618 --> 21:00.366
during the summer. They engage in summer

21:00.398 --> 21:04.050
reading. And yes, our libraries will be open for

21:04.120 --> 21:07.410
those activities to keep their minds

21:07.830 --> 21:11.286
active through having fun.

21:11.388 --> 21:15.010
Through reading and having fun and library

21:15.090 --> 21:18.582
programs during the summer because there

21:18.636 --> 21:22.502
is national research that shows

21:22.556 --> 21:26.666
that kids that are not engaged during the summer do lose as

21:26.688 --> 21:30.346
much as a grade level and it provides a safe place for them

21:30.368 --> 21:33.834
to be sometimes. The last two

21:33.872 --> 21:37.530
other questions I had really quickly. One, do all of our libraries

21:37.610 --> 21:41.406
provide printing and scanning services currently for

21:41.428 --> 21:45.386
the public? Scanning, like scanning digital

21:45.498 --> 21:49.294
paper copies that they may need to be scanned, but also printing

21:49.342 --> 21:52.674
services? I'm not sure if all

21:52.712 --> 21:56.210
of them do, a number of them do.

21:56.360 --> 22:00.402
I can get that answer to you. I would just be interested in the cost

22:00.536 --> 22:04.114
breakdown of what that is. I know I've been looking in the district if there's

22:04.162 --> 22:08.150
something that needs to be supplemented out of district service funds for printing,

22:08.490 --> 22:10.120
oftentimes, again,

22:11.930 --> 22:14.874
for those that may not be able to afford it. Right. Those people that are

22:14.912 --> 22:18.538
trying to apply for a job and may need just those few extra dollars,

22:18.704 --> 22:21.660
those types of needs. I'm just trying to explore that.

22:22.110 --> 22:25.798
Printing is everywhere. Scanning. That's what

22:25.824 --> 22:29.402
I'd have to check on. Okay, I would appreciate that. And lastly,

22:29.546 --> 22:32.846
due to the financial constraints that the city continues to

22:32.868 --> 22:36.640
face throughout every single department, what are the

22:37.730 --> 22:41.486
needs that you foresee for the most immediate and long term

22:41.518 --> 22:45.186
future that we are not able to meet right now that you want us

22:45.208 --> 22:49.010
to be focused on? What I'd like

22:49.080 --> 22:53.206
to say as a reply to that question to

22:53.308 --> 22:57.202
all council members is to appreciate

22:57.266 --> 23:01.142
what the Houston Public Library is able to provide for our

23:01.196 --> 23:05.018
citizens. But when you look at our

23:05.184 --> 23:06.730
bottom line budget,

23:08.270 --> 23:12.042
our bottom line budget, even with the increase this

23:12.096 --> 23:16.350
year, is a far cry for even Chicago's Public

23:16.420 --> 23:20.142
Library. That serves 4.6

23:20.196 --> 23:28.560
million people with a budget of 100,000,003.

23:29.030 --> 23:31.938
And our budget is at 50 million.

23:32.104 --> 23:34.420
So you can see the difference.

23:35.830 --> 23:39.442
So that would be it. The more money we have in our budget, the more

23:39.496 --> 23:42.280
we can continue to provide services.

23:42.730 --> 23:46.566
We staff our facilities at the bare minimum, except for

23:46.588 --> 23:50.662
those that are the busiest. And I think

23:50.796 --> 23:54.014
that's where the community is being shortchanged.

23:54.082 --> 23:56.810
Because we had more robust staff,

23:57.310 --> 23:59.660
we certainly could provide more services.

24:04.590 --> 24:08.494
Thank you for that presentation and those answers. We'll now move into

24:08.612 --> 24:12.266
the public comment period. The first public speaker

24:12.298 --> 24:14.270
will be Mr. Jason Oliver.

24:21.090 --> 24:24.990
Hi. I love the library.

24:25.070 --> 24:28.020
I really appreciate everything that you all do.

24:28.870 --> 24:32.360
I just want to start off saying that. Thank you. Thank you so much.

24:32.730 --> 24:36.658
First. I know. The Harris County Library system has rolled

24:36.674 --> 24:39.862
out the enhanced ID program this year. I actually

24:39.916 --> 24:43.686
tried to use mine to come in. I don't know why we need

24:43.708 --> 24:47.286
an ID to come into this building, but I tried to use it and wasn't

24:47.318 --> 24:51.290
allowed. So I hope that that can change, because that's a really important program.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.582
But I wanted to ask if HPL

24:54.726 --> 24:58.282
is planning to join that and what will be needed for HPL

24:58.346 --> 25:01.200
to be able to do that. So that's my first question.

25:01.890 --> 25:05.822
And then second, it's often hard to find books by local

25:05.876 --> 25:09.202
authors in the library's collections. How could we create a program

25:09.256 --> 25:12.722
or initiative focused on acquiring the works of local

25:12.776 --> 25:16.130
authors? So, first, that enhanced ID program, and then second,

25:16.280 --> 25:19.140
local author acquisitions and wrapping those up?

25:20.410 --> 25:24.134
Thank you for those questions. In terms

25:24.172 --> 25:27.526
of enhanced ID, that's something that we can certainly

25:27.708 --> 25:31.574
look into. We haven't had that as a priority for

25:31.612 --> 25:34.922
the library system. We've had other priorities, but we certainly

25:34.976 --> 25:38.682
can look into that and update you on that

25:38.736 --> 25:42.970
research. And your second question was about

25:43.040 --> 25:46.318
local author acquisitions and how we might be able to create,

25:46.404 --> 25:49.310
just acquire more works by local authors.

25:49.650 --> 25:53.514
We are increasingly

25:53.562 --> 25:57.862
focused on building our local author collection.

25:58.026 --> 26:01.950
We have an ongoing local author display.

26:02.110 --> 26:05.454
We have local author programs inviting

26:05.582 --> 26:09.882
local authors to come and even participate

26:09.966 --> 26:13.474
in workshops when experienced

26:13.522 --> 26:16.742
local authors will give advice to those

26:16.796 --> 26:21.154
authors that are trying to start publishing

26:21.282 --> 26:24.614
and how to get started. So we are focused

26:24.662 --> 26:28.358
on it. We probably need to do more promotion

26:28.454 --> 26:32.982
about that, but we are very embracing

26:33.046 --> 26:36.560
of local authors. Okay.

26:39.250 --> 26:42.542
I just find it hard to find their books in the libraries and especially

26:42.596 --> 26:44.270
in the digital collections.

26:46.130 --> 26:50.494
Author is not a part of the permanent

26:50.542 --> 26:54.290
library collection. Right, and I can

26:54.360 --> 26:58.050
explain more about that. I'd be happy to. Okay,

26:58.120 --> 27:01.110
thank you. Stop up landing.

27:07.060 --> 27:10.220
I just want a second appreciation

27:10.300 --> 27:14.592
for the library. We love it. It's such a nourishing space

27:14.726 --> 27:17.968
for the community and I love it so much. I brought my daughter and I'm

27:17.984 --> 27:20.950
trying to talk her into speaking and asking you a question,

27:21.400 --> 27:25.556
but for my time I have a question for you based on

27:25.578 --> 27:29.204
your metrics. The library has a huge impact on Houstonians.

27:29.252 --> 27:31.640
I know our family has felt that personally,

27:33.100 --> 27:36.648
I'm curious what we know about whether library access or specific

27:36.734 --> 27:41.256
services are equitably and how they're equitably

27:41.368 --> 27:45.084
distributed across the city. Thank you for that

27:45.122 --> 27:49.020
question. Our one Houston one library

27:49.440 --> 27:53.616
master plan is based on that one word

27:53.798 --> 27:57.324
equity. And we're looking many of the council

27:57.372 --> 28:01.392
members have participated in seeing

28:01.526 --> 28:05.250
that presentation of our master plan.

28:05.640 --> 28:09.700
But it involves seven regions

28:10.280 --> 28:13.620
and in those seven regions what we plan to do

28:13.690 --> 28:17.344
is have similar services, if not the

28:17.402 --> 28:21.272
exact services, similar services in each of those

28:21.326 --> 28:25.352
regions so that people don't have to go from one

28:25.406 --> 28:28.888
community to another unless they just want to.

28:29.054 --> 28:32.684
But that's what we're striving to be a

28:32.722 --> 28:36.604
city of equitable library services across the city.

28:36.722 --> 28:39.790
I appreciate that and I love that idea. Thank you.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.220
Geogrosal,

28:50.160 --> 28:53.676
hi. First I want to say same thing about the

28:53.698 --> 28:56.956
library. Actually, my number one thing I use most on

28:56.978 --> 29:00.476
my phone is my Libby app. I love that app.

29:00.578 --> 29:03.984
It gets the most use of everything that I use and I

29:04.022 --> 29:07.552
appreciate it. And especially since the library has been closed, to be able to use

29:07.606 --> 29:11.536
that has been phenomenal. So thank you. Thank you.

29:11.718 --> 29:14.070
And I also tell everyone about it.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.404
I wanted to ask you, are there any programs that the library I'm going to

29:18.442 --> 29:22.260
invite you to do an ad for the library.

29:23.560 --> 29:27.050
Somebody's going to come up to you and get that because we're looking to

29:27.500 --> 29:30.904
have more user comments on

29:30.942 --> 29:34.804
our library and if you found something that's really useful, I appreciate

29:34.852 --> 29:38.376
that. I would love to do that for you. Tell me where and

29:38.398 --> 29:40.910
when somebody approach you. Okay.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.192
Are there any programs that the library is interested in implementing

29:45.256 --> 29:49.372
or seeking to implement for which it doesn't currently have the necessary

29:49.436 --> 29:50.240
funding?

29:55.060 --> 29:57.010
How long a time do you have?

29:59.620 --> 30:02.900
We always want to do more. We think we've hit

30:03.050 --> 30:06.576
a good balance with understanding what the citizens

30:06.608 --> 30:09.844
of our city want and need. We just like to do

30:09.882 --> 30:13.588
more of it. Longer. That would require

30:13.684 --> 30:17.304
longer hours, more weekend services, more access to

30:17.342 --> 30:20.744
the library. Okay, well, let me know how I can help.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.810
All right. Somebody approach you?

30:24.480 --> 30:28.124
Roderick Butler. We're getting Sunday coming

30:28.162 --> 30:30.990
soon. Didn't say that,

30:34.480 --> 30:38.016
Director. I stand with

30:38.198 --> 30:41.312
all of these people that we

30:41.366 --> 30:43.970
would be wherever, do whatever,

30:44.420 --> 30:48.880
because thank you. You are a treasure.

30:49.800 --> 30:53.620
Libraries provide a safety net for communities,

30:53.960 --> 30:57.120
for our children, for our adults,

30:57.280 --> 31:00.340
and they are there in our good,

31:00.410 --> 31:04.360
our bad, and sometimes they're just there, and that's all it requires.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.656
But I would like to ask you about my community.

31:07.838 --> 31:11.076
There is a little library called Scenic Wood Regional

31:11.108 --> 31:14.388
Library. We would love this may be a CIP

31:14.484 --> 31:17.768
issue to expand the footprint of that library.

31:17.864 --> 31:21.384
Basically, the capacity. It has land to the north

31:21.432 --> 31:25.224
of it vacant. It has land to the south of it. It's forest,

31:25.272 --> 31:28.764
but it's still vacant. There are other libraries like Dixon

31:28.812 --> 31:32.144
Library, which is new. We would love to expand the footprint of that.

31:32.262 --> 31:35.650
I don't even know if Lakewood Library has come back online,

31:36.100 --> 31:39.584
but we need to

31:39.622 --> 31:43.540
know, do you have any plans for new libraries in the future

31:43.610 --> 31:47.220
in your master plan? How do we get it? How do we support you,

31:47.290 --> 31:49.590
and how do we give input for it?

31:50.760 --> 31:55.608
We would love to have your input with

31:55.694 --> 31:59.572
our planning for library

31:59.636 --> 32:02.904
spaces and understand better what the

32:02.942 --> 32:06.430
needs are. We have a good sense. We know that

32:07.120 --> 32:10.830
there are communities that need more.

32:11.440 --> 32:15.512
We do understand that. What I answered

32:15.656 --> 32:19.164
about services is all about capacity.

32:19.292 --> 32:23.232
It's about our CIP. It's about having

32:23.286 --> 32:26.624
enough funding to go around. And I

32:26.662 --> 32:30.196
meant what I said about equity. We're looking at each area of the

32:30.218 --> 32:33.316
city and seeing how we can

32:33.498 --> 32:37.636
be a more equitable department in

32:37.658 --> 32:40.390
terms of providing services,

32:41.480 --> 32:44.824
if not right away, a larger footprint, at least

32:44.862 --> 32:48.436
the services in those areas.

32:48.628 --> 32:52.164
Well, my heart is full and know that this is your army.

32:52.292 --> 32:55.916
Yes, it is. So you just call upon us, all right?

32:56.018 --> 33:00.796
Because we've all been in a library, and it

33:00.818 --> 33:04.156
has benefited us. So please know that. Thank you so

33:04.178 --> 33:05.390
much. Thank you.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.816
Vice Mayor Pro TEM Cassex Taylor. Thank you. I want to

33:10.838 --> 33:14.224
close with this comment. Director Lawson. When we were

33:14.262 --> 33:18.144
looking to build our library in District A, we had an opportunity to

33:18.182 --> 33:22.176
take a tour of some libraries throughout the city hosted

33:22.208 --> 33:26.036
by your staff, and we've had quite a

33:26.058 --> 33:29.972
few residents from District B to talk

33:30.026 --> 33:33.512
about their concerns. But I will tell you, this is one

33:33.566 --> 33:37.432
area where I can tell you firsthand that

33:37.486 --> 33:41.224
District B is shining bright, because we got to

33:41.262 --> 33:45.610
visit the library and saw the tech link and all the technology

33:46.160 --> 33:49.868
in the library in District B. And I will tell you,

33:49.954 --> 33:53.484
I was like, I want all that in our new

33:53.522 --> 33:56.936
library in District K too. So I hear you

33:56.978 --> 34:00.930
when you talk about equity and you talk about making sure that

34:01.380 --> 34:05.248
our communities that have found themselves many times

34:05.334 --> 34:09.532
to be maybe

34:09.606 --> 34:13.552
not having the same level of resources that the library

34:13.696 --> 34:17.796
has walked the walk. And the resources that are available in

34:17.818 --> 34:21.104
the libraries in District B were phenomenal

34:21.152 --> 34:24.952
when we were there on the tour. So thank you for caring about

34:25.006 --> 34:28.248
the citizens of Houston and making sure that we

34:28.334 --> 34:32.196
all have access to great quality libraries throughout

34:32.228 --> 34:36.024
the city of Houston. We appreciate all that you do. This is probably the

34:36.062 --> 34:39.964
happiest budget amendment I mean, budget session of

34:40.002 --> 34:43.372
all of the ones that we'll hear over this week. So we

34:43.426 --> 34:46.460
appreciate all the work that you do. Did you say amendment?

34:47.440 --> 34:51.600
I have amendment on my mind because I'm thinking about those passports.

34:52.820 --> 34:56.496
Thank you. I really appreciate all the support that all of

34:56.518 --> 34:58.800
you give to the library.

35:01.540 --> 35:04.150
Daughter Blending, did you want to sign up to speak?

35:20.570 --> 35:24.758
I like the audiobooks that the libraries provide,

35:24.924 --> 35:28.134
and I want more of those for

35:28.172 --> 35:31.722
the libraries. We hear

35:31.776 --> 35:34.410
you. Which library is your library?

35:41.300 --> 35:44.496
Stonica Library. All right.

35:44.678 --> 35:46.480
More audiobooks.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.380
We'll try to accommodate your request.

35:52.840 --> 35:53.830
Thank you.

35:58.440 --> 36:01.636
Council member Cayman. Council member Cayman. Miss Blanding,

36:01.668 --> 36:05.208
I just wanted to say you did a really good job. You're probably one of

36:05.214 --> 36:09.016
the youngest people we've ever had speak at Budget, and you

36:09.038 --> 36:09.770
were awesome.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.480
And thank you for speaking up about audiobooks. We were debating

36:17.560 --> 36:21.116
that, I think, a few council sessions ago about the

36:21.138 --> 36:24.608
importance of audiobooks. So really, thank you for making such a

36:24.614 --> 36:25.170
difference.

36:27.700 --> 36:30.864
Thank you for your presentation. There are no additional in

36:30.902 --> 36:34.672
person or virtual speakers before

36:34.726 --> 36:37.836
we wrap up. Really say thank you not only to the director,

36:37.868 --> 36:40.836
but your entire staff, the entire team, all of you,

36:40.858 --> 36:44.310
all who work within the library department. We understand that

36:44.680 --> 36:48.084
budgets are tight, and you all make the best of what you can

36:48.122 --> 36:51.456
with the resources that you have. There are people all over

36:51.498 --> 36:55.016
the city who truly value, and the contributions you

36:55.038 --> 36:58.936
make to us are greatly appreciated. I think I heard you by saying there are

36:58.958 --> 37:01.572
1.4 million cardholders.

37:01.716 --> 37:04.936
Yes. That's incredible. We're rolling up

37:04.958 --> 37:08.936
on 2 million. So that's incredible. So thank you all for everything that

37:08.958 --> 37:12.984
you do. Before we adjourn, please note that the budget workshops will

37:13.022 --> 37:16.496
continue to tomorrow, Tuesday, May 17,

37:16.518 --> 37:19.996
at 10:00 A.m., with general services. Reminder to all council

37:20.028 --> 37:23.456
members to be checking SharePoint for uploaded presentations as

37:23.478 --> 37:26.832
well as responses for any questions submitted. Thank you again

37:26.886 --> 37:30.240
to everyone for being here today, and this meeting is adjourned.

37:32.100 --> 37:32.670
Thank you.
