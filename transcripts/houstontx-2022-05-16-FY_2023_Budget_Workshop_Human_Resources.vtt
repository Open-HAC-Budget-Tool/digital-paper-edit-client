WEBVTT

00:01.530 --> 00:04.990
We will now transition to Human resources.

00:05.730 --> 00:08.958
Since we are more than an hour behind, we are foregoing our break

00:09.044 --> 00:12.634
to be respectful of department representatives. So we're

00:12.682 --> 00:14.720
self sacrificing today.

00:16.930 --> 00:19.360
We do have a few snacks if you'd like,

00:21.410 --> 00:25.062
but I'm helping with you all with the weight loss program for the

00:25.156 --> 00:27.400
of Houston. As HR is here,

00:35.230 --> 00:36.890
who's running the department.

00:40.110 --> 00:42.460
It's just like a machine, right?

00:43.630 --> 00:47.662
Absolutely. Well oiled. I love it. I love it.

00:47.796 --> 00:50.862
That's how well we do it. Yes.

00:50.916 --> 00:54.746
At this time, I'd like to welcome Director Jane Cheeks and Carla Coleman

00:54.778 --> 00:58.634
as they will provide the human Resource department budget presentation.

00:58.762 --> 01:02.654
Good to have you. Thank you very much. And I apologize in advance,

01:02.702 --> 01:05.346
of course. I know we apologize to you for I get horse on the day

01:05.368 --> 01:08.674
that I have to present, but Carla has

01:08.712 --> 01:12.594
my back. I want to thank you all and good

01:12.632 --> 01:16.040
afternoon, Chair and Vice Chair and Council members.

01:16.650 --> 01:20.654
I, along with Carla Coleman, assistant Director of HR

01:20.722 --> 01:24.986
Finance, are pleased today to present

01:25.088 --> 01:28.422
our FY 23 HR

01:28.486 --> 01:31.674
budget presentation. I'm also enjoying by

01:31.712 --> 01:34.350
my executive staff, which I'll introduce shortly.

01:35.410 --> 01:39.102
The city of Houston has over 21,000

01:39.236 --> 01:42.846
employees and HR touches every one of

01:42.868 --> 01:46.510
them. Whether it's facilitating health and wellness,

01:46.670 --> 01:50.718
enhancing workplace safety, providing opportunities

01:50.814 --> 01:54.782
for training and development, caring for injured workers,

01:54.926 --> 01:57.934
working towards pay equity or recruitment,

01:57.982 --> 02:01.362
and onboarding, we never forget

02:01.506 --> 02:04.626
the human element of our department's

02:04.658 --> 02:08.326
name. Our primary purpose is to

02:08.348 --> 02:12.538
provide opportunities for transformational public service

02:12.624 --> 02:16.054
careers in an efficient and cost effective

02:16.102 --> 02:19.722
manner, all while complying with a variety of

02:19.776 --> 02:22.810
local, state and federal mandates.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.520
Next slide please.

02:27.490 --> 02:31.674
Next slide please. As you can see from our organizational

02:31.722 --> 02:35.846
structure, I have ten divisions. We will be discussing

02:35.898 --> 02:40.350
them more in detail further in the presentation.

02:40.510 --> 02:44.274
But let me pause for 2 seconds just to introduce my team.

02:44.472 --> 02:47.410
Elisa Franklin Brocks is my chief of staff.

02:48.250 --> 02:52.070
Darren Hilton is my deputy director of HR operations.

02:52.730 --> 02:57.026
Carla Coleman is my chief financial officer. Charles Smith

02:57.058 --> 02:59.670
is my assistant Director of Risk Management.

03:00.670 --> 03:03.580
Veronica Davis is my assistant Director of Benefits.

03:04.270 --> 03:07.450
Katina Swift is my chief learning officer.

03:07.950 --> 03:11.450
Velma Laws is the assistant chief policy officer.

03:12.030 --> 03:16.014
Abdi Sdecki is my deputy assistant Director over

03:16.132 --> 03:20.106
Human Resources Information Management. Bob Johnson

03:20.138 --> 03:23.466
is my compensation manager. And Leslie Denton

03:23.498 --> 03:27.106
roach is over HR Communications. And I

03:27.128 --> 03:30.434
would be remiss if I didn't introduce Aisha Roberts as

03:30.472 --> 03:34.078
the Deputy Assistant director over HR operations.

03:34.174 --> 03:37.774
And Stefan Mahal. He's the deputy assistant

03:37.822 --> 03:41.814
director. Director over risk management. I also have the

03:41.852 --> 03:45.874
team that tirelessly helped me put this benefits budget

03:45.922 --> 03:49.334
together. So Carla, would you introduce your team? Yes, my team,

03:49.372 --> 03:53.002
please stand up. The financial team, please stand

03:53.056 --> 03:57.114
up. I can't hear you, I'm sorry. So this is

03:57.152 --> 04:01.126
the core team that actually worked late nights in putting this budget

04:01.158 --> 04:04.910
numbers together. So without them, I wouldn't be able to present here today.

04:04.980 --> 04:08.174
So I thank you and I acknowledge the hard work that they put

04:08.212 --> 04:11.120
in. Thank you, Taylor. Thank you.

04:15.830 --> 04:17.140
Next slide, please.

04:19.670 --> 04:23.314
This slide shows a diverse range of statutes which

04:23.352 --> 04:26.846
we must comply to. Our goal is to administer

04:26.958 --> 04:32.242
all compliance initiatives in a manner that minimizes

04:32.306 --> 04:36.002
risk and maximizes compliance with each statute,

04:36.146 --> 04:40.082
thus shielding the city from potential penalties

04:40.226 --> 04:42.140
and legal cost.

04:42.910 --> 04:46.838
Mayor Turner often speaks about incrementalist.

04:47.014 --> 04:49.530
He states we should be transformational.

04:50.910 --> 04:54.474
We made some major strides here in the HR

04:54.522 --> 04:58.174
Department department in FY 22, one being

04:58.212 --> 05:02.122
the passage of the Prenatal Parental and Infant Wellness

05:02.266 --> 05:06.102
Ordinance. The next one will be one of our largest

05:06.186 --> 05:09.140
projects, the HR One project,

05:09.590 --> 05:13.246
which is a collaboration with Director Kent and the Hits

05:13.278 --> 05:17.186
team and Director Piyas in the Payroll team, where we

05:17.208 --> 05:21.110
will implement Success Factors and Employee central.

05:21.610 --> 05:24.310
We are also implementing a new platform,

05:24.460 --> 05:28.470
Benefits Focus, for our benefits administration.

05:28.810 --> 05:32.886
We will make history with the Benefit Focus implementation

05:32.998 --> 05:36.854
by finally ridding our valued retirees

05:36.982 --> 05:40.694
of a paper intensive process of electing

05:40.742 --> 05:44.766
and changing their benefits. Both Success

05:44.868 --> 05:49.166
Factors and Benefit Focus will offer the

05:49.188 --> 05:53.130
mobility function which is crucial in our digital

05:53.210 --> 05:54.350
transformation.

05:55.990 --> 05:59.234
Another major project in HR is zero is

05:59.272 --> 06:02.180
possible. It's called zip. Our safety program.

06:02.550 --> 06:06.066
We have been instrumental in leading safety from top to

06:06.088 --> 06:10.066
bottom by providing all employees, from directors

06:10.178 --> 06:14.086
to frontline workers, with the understanding that zero

06:14.188 --> 06:16.600
accidents are truly possible.

06:17.290 --> 06:20.706
We are also implementing several new technical services to

06:20.748 --> 06:24.698
assist us in providing a higher level of customer service,

06:24.864 --> 06:28.250
such as analytical data through power

06:28.320 --> 06:30.410
bi. Next slide.

06:33.730 --> 06:37.706
With our strong commitment to technological advancement,

06:37.818 --> 06:41.338
the footprint we will leave on our organization

06:41.514 --> 06:45.758
will be a model of how HR should conduct business

06:45.844 --> 06:48.674
in municipalities for years to come.

06:48.872 --> 06:52.654
Today we will present our FY proposed budget.

06:52.782 --> 06:56.542
We have reviewed the services that HR

06:56.606 --> 06:59.830
provides to our client department and

06:59.900 --> 07:03.026
integrated all the HR functions residing

07:03.058 --> 07:07.160
in the General Fund into our Central Services Revolving Fund.

07:07.610 --> 07:11.034
The mayor's higher Houston youth program will be the

07:11.072 --> 07:14.140
only thing that will remain in our general fund.

07:14.670 --> 07:17.210
This will allow more efficiency,

07:18.670 --> 07:22.362
more efficient delivery of services for

07:22.416 --> 07:25.614
HR. Now I will turn the

07:25.652 --> 07:29.470
presentation over to my CFO to discuss the budget further.

07:30.210 --> 07:33.230
Thank you, Director Cheeks. And good afternoon,

07:35.250 --> 07:38.130
Chair. Vice Chair. Mayor Per term and council members.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.806
So, what you have in front of you is the functional

07:41.838 --> 07:45.762
chart for HR, which is proposed a budget of $514,000,000

07:45.816 --> 07:50.182
and it funds 448.7

07:50.236 --> 07:53.506
FTEs. And this is done through five funds.

07:53.538 --> 07:56.870
We have a General fund, two revolving funds and two

07:56.940 --> 08:00.038
Internal Services Fund. In the General Fund,

08:00.124 --> 08:05.162
we are proposing a budget of 1.5 million to fund 152.7

08:05.216 --> 08:08.300
FTE for the Hara Houston Youth Program.

08:08.830 --> 08:13.174
Then in the revolving funds, we have the Central Service Revolving Fund,

08:13.312 --> 08:16.510
which the proposed budget is 38 million

08:16.580 --> 08:19.934
and it funds 185 FTE and

08:19.972 --> 08:23.514
the budget is 8% of the combined HR

08:23.562 --> 08:27.534
budget. Then the other revolving fund is the Workers Compensation

08:27.582 --> 08:31.234
Fund, which the proposed budget is 45 million. And it

08:31.272 --> 08:35.170
funds 60 FTEs and it represents 9%

08:35.240 --> 08:38.594
of the combined HR budget. And then

08:38.632 --> 08:41.846
from the Internal Revenue Internal Services Fund we

08:41.868 --> 08:47.046
have the Health Benefit Fund which is budgeted at 428,000,000 and

08:47.068 --> 08:51.402
it funds 51 FTEs and it represents 85%

08:51.456 --> 08:54.678
of HR's budget. And lastly the Long Term

08:54.694 --> 08:58.538
Disability Fund which is budgeted at 1.6 million,

08:58.624 --> 09:02.646
represents less than 1% of the HR's

09:02.678 --> 09:06.074
budgeted fund and it doesn't have any personnel associated

09:06.122 --> 09:08.400
with it. Next slide please.

09:10.130 --> 09:13.534
This is the functional chart for the General Fund

09:13.572 --> 09:16.826
and as I mentioned, the only thing funded here is the Har

09:16.868 --> 09:20.306
Houston Youth for 1.5 million and

09:20.328 --> 09:23.858
it funds 152.7 FTEs or

09:23.944 --> 09:28.222
509 positions. We have expecting 500

09:28.296 --> 09:31.906
interns and nine career coaches. Next slide

09:31.938 --> 09:35.522
please. This is the central

09:35.586 --> 09:40.390
revolving fund for HR and the proposed budget is $38 million

09:40.540 --> 09:43.718
and it funds 185 FTEs

09:43.814 --> 09:47.414
in seven divisions. We are integrating

09:47.462 --> 09:51.462
the HR General Funds operational functions

09:51.526 --> 09:56.062
into this fund, so we are funding 185

09:56.196 --> 10:00.474
FTEs. In addition to the HR functions,

10:00.602 --> 10:04.094
core functions that this budget holds, we also have

10:04.132 --> 10:07.650
the budget for contingent workforce and for the training

10:07.720 --> 10:10.100
and organizational development of the city.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.020
Next slide please.

10:16.390 --> 10:20.182
This is the Workers Compensation Fund and the proposed budget is

10:20.236 --> 10:23.858
45 million and it funds 60 FTEs

10:23.954 --> 10:28.306
and three major functions managed by two divisions.

10:28.498 --> 10:31.706
The Safety and the Workers compensation functions are

10:31.728 --> 10:35.034
managed by the HR Risk Management Division and their

10:35.072 --> 10:38.854
mission is to create a safe work environment by eliminating workplace

10:38.902 --> 10:42.506
hazard, reducing the financial impact associated with

10:42.528 --> 10:46.910
the workplace injuries and by being advocates to our injured workers.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.040
Next slide please.

10:50.850 --> 10:54.314
This is the Health Benefit Fund and the proposed budget

10:54.362 --> 10:58.242
is 428,000,000 and it funds 51

10:58.296 --> 11:01.886
FTEs and four major functions managed

11:01.918 --> 11:05.106
by four divisions. This budget houses all the

11:05.128 --> 11:08.394
benefit plans for the city which includes the medical

11:08.462 --> 11:11.874
and the pharmacy plans, the supplemental plans such as dental,

11:11.922 --> 11:15.554
vision, life insurance, life dependent

11:15.602 --> 11:19.234
care, flexible spending and two Medicare Advantage

11:19.282 --> 11:23.340
plans for retirees over 65. Next slide please.

11:24.670 --> 11:28.054
And the long term disability fund, which is budgeted

11:28.102 --> 11:32.026
at 1.6 million. It doesn't have any personnel associated with

11:32.048 --> 11:36.010
it and this fund is mostly determined by an annual actuary

11:36.090 --> 11:39.280
evaluation and it happens at year end.

11:40.690 --> 11:44.286
Next slide please. Now this

11:44.308 --> 11:48.242
is the revenue slide for most departments and

11:48.376 --> 11:52.014
this chart compares the proposed budget for next fiscal

11:52.062 --> 11:55.570
year with this current year's estimate.

11:56.550 --> 12:00.210
So I want to say that HR is not a revenue generating

12:00.290 --> 12:04.690
department, so our revenues are products of chargebacks

12:04.770 --> 12:08.742
to the departments for actual program and services and

12:08.796 --> 12:12.282
based on utilization. And also it's a product

12:12.336 --> 12:16.806
of contribution from employees, retirees and city departments.

12:16.918 --> 12:21.082
So this chart shows an increase of 9.5% or

12:21.136 --> 12:23.820
45 million. Next slide please.

12:27.020 --> 12:30.564
Now this slide covers the key drivers that increases

12:30.612 --> 12:34.136
the proposed revenues, but they are the same key drivers that are

12:34.158 --> 12:38.140
actually increasing the expense sites. So we'll talk about them

12:38.210 --> 12:41.436
later in the expense sites because they're exactly the same as we're not

12:41.458 --> 12:44.910
a revenue generating department. Next slide please.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.944
So this is the expend budget for HR and

12:50.982 --> 12:54.588
this chart compares the FY 23 proposed budget

12:54.684 --> 12:57.904
with this year's current budget. And as you can

12:57.942 --> 13:01.452
see, the 23 budget is proposed

13:01.516 --> 13:05.910
with an increase of 23 million or 4.7%.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.750
Next slide please.

13:09.560 --> 13:13.076
This slide actually has the key drivers for both

13:13.098 --> 13:16.820
the revenue and the expenses. And this

13:16.890 --> 13:20.136
23 million is broken down as follows. So we

13:20.158 --> 13:23.992
see first the General Fund that has a decrease of 2.5 million,

13:24.126 --> 13:28.010
or 62.1%, and mainly this is to

13:28.700 --> 13:32.316
the merger of the HR operations activities and the

13:32.338 --> 13:36.172
General Fund with a Central Service Revolving Fund. So the only thing

13:36.226 --> 13:39.180
left in the General fund is the har Houston youth.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.864
Then the next thing we have is the Central Revolving Fund

13:42.982 --> 13:46.720
which increased by 6.9 million or 20%,

13:46.870 --> 13:51.052
and the increases are due to increased utilization

13:51.196 --> 13:55.124
in temporary service personnel. And we also added this year

13:55.242 --> 13:58.816
the fire department officer ranking exam for captain

13:58.848 --> 14:02.112
and senior captain. We also have personnel increases

14:02.176 --> 14:06.104
due to hope and benefits as well as cost increases for technology

14:06.222 --> 14:09.320
initiatives that Director Cheeks mentioned earlier.

14:09.900 --> 14:13.576
The Workers Compensation Fund increased by 6.1 million or

14:13.598 --> 14:17.896
15%, mostly due to catastrophic high claims related to

14:18.078 --> 14:21.276
COVID. We also have personnel increases in this fund as

14:21.298 --> 14:25.340
well. And then the health benefit increase of 13 million

14:25.410 --> 14:29.372
or 3.1 is mostly due to premium rate increases of

14:29.426 --> 14:32.736
6.5% from 3.4% last year.

14:32.838 --> 14:36.796
We also have high claim cost in this fund related

14:36.828 --> 14:40.192
to COVID and personnel increases across the board for

14:40.246 --> 14:44.770
benefits and hope. And then the long term disability also has

14:45.220 --> 14:48.644
an increase in rates which increased the budget by

14:48.682 --> 14:52.660
85,000 or 5%. But the increase is mostly due to

14:52.810 --> 14:56.324
participation count increases which drives the claim

14:56.372 --> 14:59.130
increases as well. Next slide, please.

15:01.900 --> 15:06.180
Now in the next six slides we're going to see the HR's budget allocated

15:06.260 --> 15:09.272
between personnel and non personnel cost.

15:09.406 --> 15:13.352
In this slide in front of you, you have the proposed budget combined budget

15:13.416 --> 15:17.452
of 514,000,000. It allocates 7%

15:17.506 --> 15:21.872
of this budget to personnel to fund 448.7

15:21.926 --> 15:26.176
FTEs and this is done with $34 million.

15:26.358 --> 15:30.044
Then the 93% remaining of the budget goes to non personnel

15:30.092 --> 15:34.132
expenses or other expenses for 480,000,000.

15:34.266 --> 15:38.596
Out of this, 480,000,076% is

15:38.698 --> 15:42.272
allocated to claim expenses for the benefit

15:42.336 --> 15:46.212
funds. Then 11% goes to

15:46.266 --> 15:50.180
other health benefit plans which includes supplemental plans and retirees

15:50.340 --> 15:54.056
plans. Then it goes to Workers Compensation claims for 8% and

15:54.078 --> 15:57.676
the remaining of the budget goes to other services, supplies and

15:57.698 --> 16:01.310
restricted accounts. Next slide please.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.264
This one is the allocation of the General Fund budget for Har Houston

16:06.312 --> 16:10.876
Youth, and it allocates 98% of its budget to personnel

16:10.988 --> 16:14.764
to fund 152.7 FTEs,

16:14.892 --> 16:18.656
or 509 positions, and the remainder of

16:18.678 --> 16:22.616
the budget of 31,000. You find it allocated

16:22.668 --> 16:26.550
to other services and supplies. Next slide please.

16:28.360 --> 16:32.500
The revolving funds budget which is set at 38 million,

16:32.650 --> 16:36.056
allocates 53% of that budget to personnel to

16:36.078 --> 16:39.096
fund 185 FTEs and

16:39.118 --> 16:42.728
then the remaining 47% to fund the other person

16:42.814 --> 16:46.312
non personnel cost of 18 million. Out of this,

16:46.366 --> 16:49.804
18,000,087% of that goes to

16:49.842 --> 16:53.336
other services for 16 million and the remainder goes to restricted

16:53.368 --> 16:57.224
accounts and supplies. Next slide

16:57.272 --> 17:01.292
please. The workers compensation

17:01.356 --> 17:05.632
fund budgeted at 45 million. Allocates 15%

17:05.686 --> 17:09.996
of that budget to personnel for 60 FTEs

17:10.188 --> 17:14.156
and then 85% goes to non personnel expenses.

17:14.268 --> 17:18.964
And out of this 38 million, which is represent 85%,

17:19.162 --> 17:23.204
97% of that is just claims experience and the

17:23.242 --> 17:27.444
remainder you will find in other services, restricted and supplies,

17:27.492 --> 17:29.960
which is just 13% of that budget.

17:31.020 --> 17:32.330
Next slide please.

17:34.220 --> 17:39.950
Here you see the health benefit which is budgeted $428,000,000.

17:40.320 --> 17:44.364
Only 1% of that budget is allocated to personnel for

17:44.402 --> 17:48.104
only 50 funding, 51 FTEs. The rest of this budget,

17:48.152 --> 17:51.288
which is 422, 87% of

17:51.314 --> 17:54.108
that is allocated to health benefit claims,

17:54.284 --> 17:58.112
then 12% of that is allocated to the other health

17:58.166 --> 18:01.344
benefit plans, supplemental plans and retirees, and the

18:01.382 --> 18:05.220
remainder goes to other services, restricted accounts and supplies.

18:07.640 --> 18:11.684
Next slide please. Lastly, we have the

18:11.722 --> 18:14.924
Long term Disability Fund which has no personnel

18:14.992 --> 18:18.584
associated with it. So 98% of the

18:18.622 --> 18:22.644
1.6 proposed budget goes to fund claims

18:22.692 --> 18:26.424
expenses and the other 2% goes to TPA fees and

18:26.462 --> 18:29.896
actuarial service at the end of the year. Next slide

18:29.928 --> 18:33.724
please. This is

18:33.762 --> 18:37.436
the net change for the General Fund for HR. And as you can see,

18:37.458 --> 18:40.524
HR for this fiscal year has two components,

18:40.572 --> 18:43.840
the operational budget and the Har Houston Youth Program.

18:43.990 --> 18:48.144
This budget was reduced by a net reduction of 20,000

18:48.262 --> 18:52.380
for adjustments to restricted account, hope and health benefit.

18:52.540 --> 18:56.052
It further has a reduction of 2.5

18:56.186 --> 18:59.392
and that is to merge the operational activities

18:59.456 --> 19:02.790
in the General Fund into the Central Service Revolving Fund.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.080
And the only thing left in this budget is 1.5,

19:07.150 --> 19:10.904
which funds the higher Houston youth. So the net change from 22

19:10.942 --> 19:14.490
to 23 is a reduction of 62.1%.

19:16.220 --> 19:19.816
Next slide and council

19:19.848 --> 19:23.624
members, this concludes the financial presentations for the budget

19:23.672 --> 19:28.216
at HR, but I pass back to Director Cheese for closing remarks.

19:28.328 --> 19:30.960
Thank you. Thank you, Carla.

19:31.780 --> 19:35.884
Thank you, Carla. I like to thank my executive staff

19:35.932 --> 19:39.744
and every HR employee for the hard work they put

19:39.782 --> 19:43.232
in continuously each day to service our client

19:43.296 --> 19:46.644
departments and council members. I'd like to thank

19:46.682 --> 19:51.124
you also, thank you for supporting us as we continue

19:51.242 --> 19:54.692
to optimize our HR journey. Do you have any

19:54.746 --> 19:57.780
questions for us today? Yes. Council member Abby Cayman.

19:57.940 --> 20:01.384
Thank you, Mayor Pro TEM. First off, Director, to you and your

20:01.422 --> 20:04.984
entire team. Thank you. It has certainly not

20:05.022 --> 20:08.380
been an easy few years. I was looking back over the

20:08.450 --> 20:11.916
accomplishments that you listed and

20:12.018 --> 20:15.896
even when I approached you a few years ago, one parental

20:15.928 --> 20:19.780
leave, which is a massive accomplishment, but even including additional

20:19.880 --> 20:23.356
insurance program benefits like healthy

20:23.388 --> 20:26.450
babies, healthy pregnancy. But on top of all of that,

20:28.100 --> 20:31.632
you dealt with COVID you dealt with implementing a system for

20:31.686 --> 20:35.520
testing for the city you had to deal with. We talked about NIT

20:35.600 --> 20:38.980
Kronos and those issues challenge after challenge after

20:39.050 --> 20:42.964
challenge, and you all continue to serve. So thank you for that. I also just

20:43.002 --> 20:46.752
wanted to, again, just spotlight

20:46.816 --> 20:49.380
my appreciation for you as a director.

20:49.540 --> 20:53.160
You always take our calls. You work with us, of course,

20:53.230 --> 20:56.676
under Mayor Turner's leadership. But thank you for pushing the ball

20:56.708 --> 21:00.104
forward for the city in leading the way again as

21:00.142 --> 21:03.004
a city for the entire country.

21:03.202 --> 21:06.700
It's phenomenal. And again, to your entire staff, I'm looking at a few in particular.

21:06.770 --> 21:10.380
It's just a pleasure to work with you all. So congratulations. Thank you.

21:10.450 --> 21:13.808
And I forgot to ask my department question that

21:13.814 --> 21:17.052
I ask everyone. Due to the financial constraints

21:17.116 --> 21:20.528
currently faced by the city of Houston, what are needs that are

21:20.534 --> 21:23.590
not addressed in this budget that you would like us to be aware of?

21:25.880 --> 21:27.670
What needs that are not?

21:29.560 --> 21:30.310
Wow.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.280
Council Member, I want to tell you, I'm sure everybody

21:36.350 --> 21:39.688
is having staffing issues. And at the end of

21:39.694 --> 21:43.368
the day, HR is not the

21:43.374 --> 21:47.412
same for HR. We are diligently trying

21:47.486 --> 21:50.616
to staff our vacancies, and that's

21:50.648 --> 21:53.788
just something that is challenging not only

21:53.954 --> 21:57.436
for the city, but throughout the United States right

21:57.458 --> 22:01.008
now. So we continue to just

22:01.094 --> 22:04.832
make sure that we provide the highest level of customer service,

22:04.966 --> 22:08.572
but we'll continue to staff up. Well, again, I appreciate

22:08.636 --> 22:12.444
everything in the partnership. Thank you. Thank you. Council Member

22:12.492 --> 22:16.020
Michael Kubosh director Cheeks. This has been a real

22:16.090 --> 22:19.124
tough two years for me and my wife. Yes,

22:19.162 --> 22:22.276
sir. And you know it. Yes, sir. And you

22:22.298 --> 22:25.636
were there. You always took my call.

22:25.818 --> 22:29.700
Yes, sir. You always helped me. And I'm grateful

22:29.780 --> 22:33.812
to you and your staff because it's been a tough

22:33.876 --> 22:37.284
time. I broke my leg. My wife's had four surgeries,

22:37.412 --> 22:41.212
been rough. And I appreciate because

22:41.266 --> 22:44.828
a lot of times I don't know the inner workings of how it

22:44.834 --> 22:49.436
goes. So I just go to you. Yes, sir. Then you

22:49.458 --> 22:52.576
may say, well, and you've never said, I'm not the one to go to on

22:52.598 --> 22:56.444
this. You just fix it. You help me get it together. And I'm

22:56.492 --> 22:59.920
forever grateful for it. And I'm thankful

23:00.260 --> 23:03.456
that you're the head of this department at

23:03.478 --> 23:06.916
this time in my life. God bless you and thank you for your service to

23:06.938 --> 23:11.204
our city. And I thank all of you with

23:11.242 --> 23:14.576
Human resources. Council Member Sally Alcorn.

23:14.688 --> 23:18.184
Thank you, chair in the Central Service Revolving Fund, the $12.3

23:18.222 --> 23:21.604
million in contingent workforce contracts, can you describe

23:21.652 --> 23:24.090
what those are specifically? The one for the general fund.

23:25.340 --> 23:28.620
Go ahead. So we have two contracts, one for

23:28.770 --> 23:32.284
the general fund, one for special revolving fund. We established that

23:32.322 --> 23:36.060
last year when we saw the need of grant funded

23:37.040 --> 23:40.496
departments actually incurring more staffing and

23:40.518 --> 23:43.872
we had budget constraints. So according to

23:43.926 --> 23:47.152
those budget constraints and their

23:47.206 --> 23:49.948
operational needs, that's why it's increasing.

23:50.124 --> 23:53.756
So primarily COVID related then? Well, at the beginning,

23:53.788 --> 23:57.584
it was COVID related. We have a lot of grants that are still COVID related

23:57.632 --> 24:00.996
for some departments. Okay. I might ask for some more details on

24:01.018 --> 24:05.120
that. In the health benefits fund, the increase

24:05.280 --> 24:09.016
$25 a month, I believe, in the limited plan. Is that

24:09.038 --> 24:13.032
just in the Kelsey plan that employees will be paying $25

24:13.086 --> 24:16.856
a month more to address the 6.5% increase, or are

24:16.878 --> 24:19.964
those across all plans? So the

24:20.002 --> 24:23.308
$25 surcharge, you're talking about $25

24:23.474 --> 24:26.956
as it's described, for the limited plan. So,

24:26.978 --> 24:30.396
yes, it's across the board. Yes,

24:30.418 --> 24:34.960
ma'am. That's an additional additional towards the premium

24:35.300 --> 24:38.880
that employees will pay in the next year to address

24:38.950 --> 24:42.176
the rise in those costs. Yes, ma'am. And that will be the first time in

24:42.198 --> 24:45.412
three years, council Member or Alcorn, that we have

24:45.466 --> 24:48.112
actually had a charge to the employees,

24:48.176 --> 24:51.796
because up until now we have done zero

24:51.898 --> 24:55.364
for the employees. Okay. So the city has been absorbing any

24:55.402 --> 24:59.032
increases and this is passing that one. Okay. I understand $12 on the health

24:59.086 --> 25:03.944
surcharge. There is a line item with the health surcharge, $2.9 million.

25:04.142 --> 25:08.236
What is that? So those are expenses that

25:08.258 --> 25:12.844
we budget for any

25:12.882 --> 25:16.636
wellness revenues that we receive. And so as we receive it,

25:16.658 --> 25:19.740
we have to expense them. So that's what you see in that line item.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.504
I'm not sure I understand that answer. We're calling it a

25:25.622 --> 25:28.832
health surcharge. $2.9 million,

25:28.886 --> 25:32.284
expense of the account. But those are expenses

25:32.332 --> 25:35.360
that we're budgeting for any wellness.

25:35.520 --> 25:39.008
So there's a revenue component to that equals two expenses.

25:39.104 --> 25:43.636
So if there's any wellness revenue that we receive for

25:43.818 --> 25:47.750
health assessments not completed okay, that's where I was going.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.980
That's people that did not complete their health assessments,

25:51.420 --> 25:54.936
$2.9 million worth of people that didn't do that.

25:55.038 --> 25:58.772
Where's the spouse surcharge? Line item? It's included

25:58.836 --> 26:01.948
in the revenue in the contribution side. For the revenue side,

26:02.034 --> 26:05.756
I'd like to get an amount for that spouse surcharge that we're getting

26:05.778 --> 26:08.030
annually. Thank you. I'll submit the rest online.

26:09.440 --> 26:13.516
Thank you. Director Chiefs, I'll ask a question I sort

26:13.538 --> 26:16.768
of asked the other day when we had our five year forecast and some of

26:16.774 --> 26:20.304
the challenges that we're seeing, not only in the city

26:20.342 --> 26:24.256
of Houston and corporate America, as well as workforce challenges

26:24.448 --> 26:28.624
trying to get new employees, trying to maintain existing

26:28.672 --> 26:29.620
employees.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.728
I'm sure you get involved in a lot of pre employment

26:35.824 --> 26:39.444
interviews and hopefully you're getting involved in a lot of exit

26:39.492 --> 26:43.016
interviews to find out why people are leaving and going elsewhere if

26:43.038 --> 26:47.784
they choose that option. When you talk to people back

26:47.982 --> 26:51.304
years ago when the workforce was a little bit

26:51.342 --> 26:55.656
different and pre COVID, I think a lot of things have changed.

26:55.848 --> 26:59.564
And the reason why I'm saying that I'm trying to figure out when you

26:59.602 --> 27:03.212
interview potential applicants, and I'll ask your department

27:03.356 --> 27:07.040
leaders for this as well, and when you talk to folks about

27:07.110 --> 27:10.080
why they're leaving the city of Houston and going elsewhere,

27:10.980 --> 27:13.908
there's a number of dynamics that come into play.

27:14.074 --> 27:16.820
Salary, vacation.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.088
Some are looking for travel opportunities maybe that they don't

27:21.104 --> 27:24.944
get here at the city of Houston. And family life balance

27:24.992 --> 27:28.392
issues. One of the things we addressed just about a month ago

27:28.446 --> 27:32.488
with parental leave and things like that, that will go a long way to

27:32.654 --> 27:35.800
have us maintain and attract employees.

27:36.620 --> 27:40.364
Where do you see retirement benefits come

27:40.402 --> 27:44.168
into play when you talk to prospective employees

27:44.264 --> 27:48.140
or employees that are leaving to go to corporate America?

27:49.120 --> 27:52.528
That's a very good question. You specifically said

27:52.614 --> 27:56.588
retirement benefits. So in my conversations

27:56.684 --> 28:00.572
with respect to retirement benefits, they are not normally

28:00.636 --> 28:04.608
the driving factor for those individuals that are leaving the city.

28:04.774 --> 28:07.892
Most of the individuals that are actually coming into the city,

28:07.946 --> 28:11.350
sir, they are looking at our salary and our benefits.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.044
A lot of people leaving private sector are attracted to our

28:15.082 --> 28:18.548
benefits. One, because believe it or not, they are cheaper.

28:18.644 --> 28:22.456
They are cheaper than what individuals are paying right out of their pocket in

28:22.478 --> 28:26.212
the private sector, especially because of what the city contributes

28:26.276 --> 28:30.060
to those to that. But as far as the retirement,

28:30.400 --> 28:33.756
we are millennials and I say that do not give them a

28:33.778 --> 28:37.736
bad rap. They are employees

28:37.768 --> 28:40.912
who want to work and they work very hard.

28:41.046 --> 28:44.850
They're looking for their money and they're looking to get paid.

28:45.700 --> 28:49.504
And retirement is not something that they're looking at

28:49.542 --> 28:51.730
right away. Let me say it like that.

28:52.920 --> 28:56.244
In my world, people look

28:56.282 --> 28:58.740
for salary,

28:59.080 --> 29:03.264
family life balance with proper vacation, medical coverage,

29:03.312 --> 29:06.676
et cetera, and other issues

29:06.778 --> 29:10.852
related to give me my money today and give me a comfortable

29:10.916 --> 29:14.984
living today where I can do things and have the opportunity

29:15.182 --> 29:20.184
to have some time off and spend with my wife

29:20.232 --> 29:22.670
or my husband when we have kids.

29:24.160 --> 29:27.916
And I believe that the way we look at the

29:27.938 --> 29:31.100
next 30 years with our long term liability in the city,

29:31.170 --> 29:34.224
it's going to continue to grow. And the

29:34.262 --> 29:37.760
only way to not have it grow is to move to a different

29:37.830 --> 29:41.184
blended type retirement plan. But when you

29:41.222 --> 29:44.960
do that and you have the ability to start reducing your expenses,

29:45.040 --> 29:48.500
this is something that's going to happen over the next 30 to 40 years

29:48.570 --> 29:52.596
when a lot of folks like me will be in

29:52.618 --> 29:55.736
another world and not collecting the

29:55.758 --> 30:00.084
retirement pay that we collected or other employees.

30:00.212 --> 30:04.788
So if you address the employees who are buying salary,

30:04.884 --> 30:08.168
who are buying family life and are not buying

30:08.264 --> 30:12.284
retirement, aren't we losing when

30:12.322 --> 30:16.744
we don't raise salaries to compensate for a decrease

30:16.792 --> 30:20.528
on the benefit side? The benefits being the

30:20.694 --> 30:24.476
retirement pay, the defined contribution

30:24.588 --> 30:28.880
benefit plan versus moving to some type of a blended

30:29.300 --> 30:33.300
401 or what other states and cities around the United

30:33.370 --> 30:35.620
States are doing in the government sector.

30:37.560 --> 30:41.136
It's a question, but I think it's a question we need to explore

30:41.248 --> 30:44.692
because if our young millennials, as you call them,

30:44.826 --> 30:48.232
are not buying defined benefits and

30:48.286 --> 30:52.072
are buying give me more money today and let me manage my

30:52.126 --> 30:56.052
retirement. We're selling stuff they're not buying,

30:56.116 --> 30:58.988
thus they're not going to come to us. Thus they're going to leave to go

30:58.994 --> 31:03.644
to corporate America where guess what? They will be dealing with 401,

31:03.842 --> 31:07.772
not defined benefits. So my

31:07.826 --> 31:11.004
argument on this, and before I leave in a year and a half, I'd love

31:11.042 --> 31:14.336
to understand what drives the

31:14.358 --> 31:18.176
employees of the city of Houston today. And if it's because they

31:18.198 --> 31:21.344
have a defined benefit plan, I'll be the first

31:21.382 --> 31:25.036
one to say we'll stick with it. But I don't think they're buying what we're

31:25.068 --> 31:28.864
selling. They're not buying the defined benefit. They're buying

31:28.912 --> 31:32.804
give me more money today, give me a good family life balance, I want some

31:32.842 --> 31:36.784
good vacation and I want parental leave when I have kids for

31:36.842 --> 31:38.970
twelve weeks or whatever that is.

31:40.700 --> 31:43.892
What do you think? You see it every day. You're the Director of HR.

31:43.956 --> 31:47.640
I'm not. Well, let me tell you that our pension

31:48.060 --> 31:51.488
is very attractive, sir. And how many different pension plans

31:51.524 --> 31:54.812
do we have for employees that are working today? Is it four or five?

31:54.946 --> 31:58.172
It's four. It's four different plans? Yes, we have four different

31:58.226 --> 32:01.324
plans. So the defined benefit is still good.

32:01.442 --> 32:04.524
Let me tell you just give me 2 seconds or two minutes. No,

32:04.562 --> 32:06.976
you have all the time in the world. No, I know you all are.

32:06.998 --> 32:10.768
We're only running late by an hour and a half. But that's okay. What I

32:10.934 --> 32:14.004
definitely want to emphasize is that I might have answered that

32:14.042 --> 32:17.780
a little bit different two years ago before COVID came.

32:17.850 --> 32:22.260
Okay. All right, I might have answered that. So before

32:22.330 --> 32:25.384
COVID hit, we pre COVID, we did not

32:25.422 --> 32:28.488
have that many people retiring. When COVID started,

32:28.574 --> 32:32.836
we had two to 3% more people retiring.

32:32.948 --> 32:35.992
They were like, Listen, we're going to leave now.

32:36.126 --> 32:39.660
But one thing I want to tell you that really affected this,

32:39.730 --> 32:43.500
even the millennials, is that people now

32:43.650 --> 32:47.548
are looking at their family life different because people

32:47.634 --> 32:51.504
died. Vice Mayor Pro TEM and they're looking at

32:51.622 --> 32:54.940
their coworkers that are no longer here. Mothers,

32:55.020 --> 32:58.592
fathers, sisters, brothers, all of them. They're looking

32:58.646 --> 33:02.176
at the fact that they need

33:02.198 --> 33:06.068
to look at work differently. And I don't believe that

33:06.154 --> 33:08.180
it's the defined benefit.

33:09.480 --> 33:13.024
We have done well with the administration raising up our salaries,

33:13.152 --> 33:16.968
stabilizing the pension, and doing all of those things.

33:17.134 --> 33:20.408
What's most important right now to a lot of

33:20.414 --> 33:23.912
people, not just the people that are just coming to the city,

33:24.046 --> 33:28.488
it is truly being able to have that flexibility

33:28.664 --> 33:32.284
here in the workplace. And I want to tell you that the

33:32.322 --> 33:35.868
pension is still very appeasing to

33:35.954 --> 33:40.248
even millennials. It's just that COVID

33:40.344 --> 33:43.490
actually changed the way people think.

33:43.860 --> 33:47.856
Right now, individuals are looking at our benefits from

33:48.038 --> 33:51.916
having more mental stability within the workplace.

33:52.028 --> 33:54.790
Our benefits are making a difference.

33:55.560 --> 33:58.756
Our wellness is making a difference. And that

33:58.778 --> 34:02.164
is actually attracting people because wellness is big

34:02.202 --> 34:05.352
in the private sector. So when they come and see how

34:05.406 --> 34:09.064
robust our wellness program is, how they're looking at

34:09.102 --> 34:12.152
our benefits and how we pay such close

34:12.206 --> 34:15.940
attention to the mental stability of our employees,

34:16.100 --> 34:19.508
that is very important. Because right now in

34:19.534 --> 34:23.240
the United States, how we look at mental stability,

34:23.400 --> 34:26.312
whether you are young, whether you are middle aged,

34:26.376 --> 34:29.692
or you are more tenured, that is something that is being

34:29.746 --> 34:33.148
paid attention to. Vice Mayor Pro TEM she's

34:33.164 --> 34:36.400
the Vice Mayor Pro TEM I know,

34:36.550 --> 34:41.068
but my thing is we have four separate retirement plans.

34:41.244 --> 34:45.296
What about studying a fifth plan? And that fifth plan will be,

34:45.478 --> 34:49.312
if you don't value retirement play on the fine benefit

34:49.376 --> 34:52.724
side, then I'm not going to give it to you, but I'm going to pay

34:52.762 --> 34:55.190
you X percent more,

34:55.800 --> 34:57.670
5%, 10%.

34:59.580 --> 35:04.152
What are people going to do? What will people choose my

35:04.206 --> 35:07.288
age? They're going to choose a defined benefit, of course. But I

35:07.294 --> 35:10.540
think the new employees that we're getting aren't valuing again,

35:10.610 --> 35:14.076
what we're selling, we're selling that we can give them more on the

35:14.098 --> 35:17.624
base side and this thing will soften

35:17.672 --> 35:21.096
out in a number of years as you have those employees

35:21.128 --> 35:25.056
that retire and move away from the defined benefit plan.

35:25.158 --> 35:28.608
But anyway, thank you. Just things to discuss.

35:28.694 --> 35:32.524
I'd love to have a consultant look at it and see how this plays

35:32.572 --> 35:36.556
not only in the other government arenas, but also in relationship

35:36.678 --> 35:39.776
to where are we losing the people to? Are we losing them to Harris

35:39.808 --> 35:42.580
County? Are we losing them to Chevron?

35:42.920 --> 35:46.228
Who are we losing them to and why are we not competitive?

35:46.324 --> 35:50.724
Is it salary that's driving them? Because they're surely

35:50.772 --> 35:55.096
not going to leave because we have a

35:55.118 --> 35:58.904
great salary package. Maybe they'll stay for the defined benefit. Council Member

35:58.952 --> 36:01.756
Pollard thank you, Mayor Pro tim,

36:01.858 --> 36:05.372
I think that's an interesting point that you're making, and I think based on

36:05.506 --> 36:09.836
an individual's perspective on how they look at their

36:09.858 --> 36:13.840
own life trajectory and their own savings and their own current

36:13.910 --> 36:18.016
lifestyle and what they may choose. So I think that is interesting from

36:18.038 --> 36:21.952
an HR perspective, though, we keep hearing, like the great

36:22.086 --> 36:25.872
resignation. Does the city of Houston

36:26.016 --> 36:30.420
put forth non competes for new hires?

36:31.000 --> 36:34.660
So if a person comes in in a certain department,

36:38.140 --> 36:42.104
are we able to put forth a non compete clause or

36:42.142 --> 36:45.412
a mandatory stay clause that if you get hired

36:45.476 --> 36:48.868
here, you must stay for X amount of time, or if

36:48.894 --> 36:52.812
you do leave, you cannot take another job

36:52.866 --> 36:56.430
in a similar field? Are we allowed to do that? Do we do that?

36:57.440 --> 37:00.748
We have worked with the legal department on first of

37:00.754 --> 37:03.472
all, let me answer the question. No, we do not have that in the human

37:03.526 --> 37:07.504
Resources department. There have been some instances that we actually

37:07.622 --> 37:11.100
have had looked at with legal

37:11.260 --> 37:15.572
because of some incentives that are out that you

37:15.626 --> 37:18.820
are asked that, hey, if you take this incentive,

37:19.720 --> 37:23.044
we expect. You to do this, but that is just under some of the

37:23.082 --> 37:26.464
incentive plans. Not a regular hire. No.

37:26.602 --> 37:30.024
Is it allowable, though, in your

37:30.062 --> 37:33.752
conversations with Legal through the years? Is that something that is

37:33.886 --> 37:37.464
permissible? We have not discussed it

37:37.582 --> 37:41.208
under the realm of just regular hires to the city. So I

37:41.214 --> 37:44.556
can't find that out. I'd have to discuss it more with Legal, but as I

37:44.578 --> 37:47.736
said, we have used it with respect to incentive plans,

37:47.768 --> 37:51.644
which are a little different because the incentive is a little bit more than

37:51.682 --> 37:55.424
just coming on board. Thank you. Yes, sir. So I've dealt with that

37:55.462 --> 37:59.008
on both sides. If you pay an incentive up front

37:59.174 --> 38:03.120
and someone agrees to sign a non compete

38:04.020 --> 38:07.156
and they leave to go to a competitor or whatever it is, then you have

38:07.178 --> 38:10.324
the right to go back. But as the State of Texas is a strong right

38:10.362 --> 38:13.840
to work place, good luck,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.380
because it's not going to be enforceable.

38:18.220 --> 38:22.490
Vice Mayor for Tim if you just indulge me. I think it's very important

38:23.180 --> 38:27.064
that we understand that retention is

38:27.102 --> 38:30.156
going to be something that's a factor here in the city.

38:30.338 --> 38:33.740
Okay. And we have employees that are here,

38:33.890 --> 38:37.404
and as we are hiring, we have to

38:37.442 --> 38:40.512
keep the employees that are here in the city.

38:40.646 --> 38:43.792
We have to make them feel

38:43.926 --> 38:47.744
like they are wanted so that they no longer want to

38:47.782 --> 38:51.888
leave the city. I think it's very important to us

38:52.054 --> 38:55.732
as a city that we invest, and we are doing that

38:55.786 --> 38:59.012
within the Human Resources Department in training

38:59.146 --> 39:02.452
for our managers and supervisors. It's very

39:02.506 --> 39:05.968
important because in the statistical data that I

39:05.994 --> 39:09.592
have looked at, a lot of people don't leave because of money.

39:09.726 --> 39:13.268
They leave because of their supervisors and managers.

39:13.364 --> 39:17.092
And it's very important that we make an investment

39:17.156 --> 39:20.364
in training. I have a new Chief Financial I'm sorry,

39:20.402 --> 39:24.440
a new Chief Learning Officer that's here that has set up a very robust

39:24.520 --> 39:28.412
program. And we are just looking forward to training our

39:28.466 --> 39:32.272
managers and supervisors to help with

39:32.406 --> 39:36.588
understanding and being more empathetic as their managers

39:36.604 --> 39:40.416
and supervisors, making sure that they understand how to deal with

39:40.438 --> 39:44.100
the employees so we don't have that revolving door.

39:44.760 --> 39:48.276
Yes, sir. Council Member Pollard on the

39:48.298 --> 39:52.196
incentive part. So, the City of Houston, we have so

39:52.218 --> 39:55.508
many attractions,

39:55.604 --> 39:59.210
events, all types of

39:59.660 --> 40:03.224
things that come to our city that we as a city are

40:03.262 --> 40:07.130
a part of, and we could probably package together

40:08.240 --> 40:12.652
as some type of incentive for employees, whether it's going

40:12.706 --> 40:15.980
to certain different attractions, events,

40:16.400 --> 40:19.788
sporting games, concerts, whatever. Right. The city of

40:19.794 --> 40:23.568
Houston, I think, should leverage our partnership with a

40:23.574 --> 40:27.308
lot of these different entities, whether it's Houston first, whether it's

40:27.324 --> 40:30.770
the different sporting venues or whatever,

40:31.140 --> 40:34.944
so that we can find as many perks to

40:34.982 --> 40:38.500
work for. The city of Houston. That as a company,

40:38.650 --> 40:42.720
we're able to offer you packages

40:42.800 --> 40:46.116
to where you may be eligible for this, that, and or third, for you,

40:46.138 --> 40:49.716
your family, or whoever. Right. Just like if you're in the

40:49.738 --> 40:53.304
private sector, they're going to try to think of as many perks as possible to

40:53.342 --> 40:56.584
lure you into wanting to work for them. But we, as a City

40:56.622 --> 41:00.604
of Houston, we have partnerships with everybody, right? And even

41:00.642 --> 41:05.656
as council members, we always get all types of invitations

41:05.768 --> 41:09.432
and all types of different ways in which we can engage

41:09.496 --> 41:13.392
and partake in the things that Houston has to offer. It would be great

41:13.446 --> 41:16.976
to leverage our ability as a city with all the

41:16.998 --> 41:20.592
different entities across the board, to be able to

41:20.646 --> 41:24.256
have packages in place through HR, to where people who

41:24.278 --> 41:27.364
work for the city are eligible to be able to go to some of these

41:27.402 --> 41:31.124
things as well, to make their jobs and their

41:31.162 --> 41:34.820
duties more attractive. Council Member Pollock, you are exactly

41:34.890 --> 41:38.696
correct, and the HR department has already started that

41:38.878 --> 41:42.612
we already have online. And maybe we need to make sure it's bigger

41:42.676 --> 41:46.596
so that our employees see it. We already have a lot of partnerships

41:46.708 --> 41:50.296
with the Rockets, the Texans for Discounts.

41:50.328 --> 41:54.792
And we actually have on our website a City of Houston's discount

41:54.856 --> 41:58.476
page that shows employees of the City of

41:58.498 --> 42:01.728
Houston about those perks. Now, do we need to

42:01.734 --> 42:05.296
do more? We are trying to do more right now, and we

42:05.318 --> 42:09.424
are leveraging everything that comes to us with reference to

42:09.542 --> 42:13.472
giving our employees discounts from taking the kids to the different

42:13.526 --> 42:16.996
circuses and those type things. So we'll just make it bigger on our

42:17.018 --> 42:20.390
web page. But we are that's great to hear. All right, thank you. We are.

42:21.480 --> 42:25.444
Okay, we have four public speakers.

42:25.492 --> 42:27.720
The first we'll go to is Mr. Doug Smith.

42:28.300 --> 42:29.160
Doug,

42:32.380 --> 42:33.450
star six.

42:36.620 --> 42:38.460
Come on, Doug. You know the gig.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.644
Okay. Jason Oliver. Jason, just come to this mic right here,

42:45.682 --> 42:47.070
sir. Thank you.

42:53.520 --> 42:56.856
I just want to say thank you and congratulations on the

42:56.898 --> 43:00.624
on the paid leave. That's really exciting. And I know it's something

43:00.662 --> 43:04.084
that I've been hearing is really good for the city.

43:04.282 --> 43:08.208
First, something the Finance Department kind of pushed

43:08.304 --> 43:12.196
us toward you all was a question about a

43:12.218 --> 43:15.924
comparative analysis of employee pay. Has HR done

43:16.122 --> 43:19.908
such a comparative analysis on employee pay across city departments?

43:20.004 --> 43:23.560
If so, where can we find it and what needs have you identified?

43:24.940 --> 43:28.728
And then I have one other question that comes from page seven.

43:28.894 --> 43:33.256
How was that one and a half million for higher Houston youth decided?

43:33.448 --> 43:37.096
And then what outcomes can we anticipate from significantly increasing

43:37.128 --> 43:40.796
that funding? I care a lot about youth programming. That's really important to

43:40.818 --> 43:44.844
me. And so trying to think about how we can expand higher Houston youth

43:44.892 --> 43:48.800
and really kind of build on that, because that 1.5 million

43:48.870 --> 43:51.970
has been static for a couple of years now, at least.

43:52.840 --> 43:56.516
So let me start with your first question, which I

43:56.538 --> 44:00.464
believe was in reference to the comparative the comparative

44:00.512 --> 44:04.550
pay analysis. So per the financial policy yes,

44:04.860 --> 44:08.324
we just completed that analysis.

44:08.452 --> 44:12.104
So we will be doing a presentation to this

44:12.142 --> 44:15.736
council in the next two months. So we did

44:15.758 --> 44:19.448
it on fire, police and municipal employees.

44:19.544 --> 44:23.164
That has been completed. And now we will do

44:23.202 --> 44:27.464
a presentation as per the financial policy to council,

44:27.512 --> 44:31.804
and that will be made available. Okay. All right, with reference

44:31.852 --> 44:35.516
to higher Houston youth, and I believe it was council

44:35.548 --> 44:39.568
member was it council member Green that actually started

44:39.654 --> 44:42.912
the 1.5 million for talking

44:42.966 --> 44:46.564
about the higher Houston youth. And so that has been something that

44:46.602 --> 44:50.452
has been in the budget for a long time.

44:50.586 --> 44:54.832
The administration would have to raise that 1.5

44:54.906 --> 44:58.408
million. We accepted what was given to us.

44:58.494 --> 45:01.832
Of course, we would be glad to do more with

45:01.886 --> 45:05.512
more, but that has just been what

45:05.566 --> 45:08.280
has been allotted for the youth,

45:08.440 --> 45:12.156
for the city since the institution of

45:12.178 --> 45:16.044
higher Houston youth. And what outcomes could we expect from increasing that

45:16.082 --> 45:19.324
funding? Well, right now we have been

45:19.362 --> 45:23.196
able, by bringing higher Houston youth into the city's budget,

45:23.308 --> 45:27.232
we have been able to increase the number of people of

45:27.286 --> 45:31.184
youth that could come in and work here at the city. So when

45:31.222 --> 45:34.580
we started, we were right at like a little over 400.

45:34.730 --> 45:38.580
Now we're actually able, because it's in house, to bring in

45:38.650 --> 45:42.164
500 and therefore also bring in

45:42.202 --> 45:46.088
the coaches. We have nine coaches. We believe it's important

45:46.254 --> 45:50.312
that the youth are actually taught how

45:50.366 --> 45:52.904
to, when they go out there, what they have to do.

45:53.022 --> 45:56.744
So we go one step further by actually

45:56.862 --> 46:00.584
having them coming to class, actually showing them what's

46:00.632 --> 46:04.616
expected of them. So that can only be bigger

46:04.808 --> 46:09.116
as our funding increases. Because the most important thing is that

46:09.298 --> 46:13.456
children and youth learn by example. So we have to be able

46:13.558 --> 46:17.090
to teach them to reach them. Okay. Okay.

46:17.700 --> 46:21.564
Sarah Blanding, 1 minute,

46:21.612 --> 46:25.584
please. 1 second.

46:25.782 --> 46:29.028
I'd love to see how you okay, I have a couple of

46:29.034 --> 46:32.356
questions. You've kind of answered them some way, but I just want to open the

46:32.378 --> 46:36.184
floor to fill in. What are the

46:36.222 --> 46:39.210
city's greatest staffing needs as you see them?

46:40.860 --> 46:44.472
Oh, no, it wasn't okay. What are the city's greatest staffing needs

46:44.526 --> 46:47.816
as you see them? And what would you need not

46:47.838 --> 46:51.356
just working within your current limitations, but let's talk

46:51.378 --> 46:54.796
about an ideal world to increase staffing and

46:54.818 --> 46:58.412
retention to fully meet the needs of the city of Houston. And then

46:58.466 --> 47:01.884
along with that is our temporary employee expenditures are much

47:01.922 --> 47:05.376
higher than in previous years. I know to

47:05.398 --> 47:08.864
some extent you've probably already answered that. Why do you think that is?

47:08.902 --> 47:12.288
And how can we increase retention among city employees? And I'd love to

47:12.294 --> 47:14.884
hear the answer. Not just like working with the loaves and fishes you have,

47:14.922 --> 47:18.656
but if somebody performed a miracle and you actually had what you needed to feed

47:18.688 --> 47:21.510
the crowd. Okay,

47:22.840 --> 47:26.628
let me say that any entity,

47:26.804 --> 47:30.488
city government, you are always going to

47:30.654 --> 47:33.816
need more funding at the end

47:33.838 --> 47:37.672
of the day, the city's budget is what we have. And like you say,

47:37.726 --> 47:42.076
if we were given more money, I'm sure we'd have more people.

47:42.258 --> 47:45.484
But we have services that we have to provide to

47:45.522 --> 47:49.292
our residents. And what we have done is to ensure that we

47:49.346 --> 47:52.544
are providing that level of services to

47:52.582 --> 47:56.288
our residents, even with the staffing levels that we have.

47:56.454 --> 47:59.724
Our city employees work hard. They work smart

47:59.772 --> 48:03.136
too. And so it's very important, if I

48:03.158 --> 48:07.316
got more money, the departments I

48:07.338 --> 48:11.776
hire for the whole city, but at the end of the day, those departments

48:11.808 --> 48:15.030
would have to specify the specific needs.

48:15.900 --> 48:19.556
I'm the person that has to get the people in there. I don't

48:19.588 --> 48:23.480
want to I don't want to speak for police and fire.

48:23.630 --> 48:27.016
I can't, because the chiefs know what they need in

48:27.038 --> 48:30.744
their departments. But I'm sure if any department

48:30.872 --> 48:34.104
was the funding was increased, that would assist

48:34.152 --> 48:37.932
them in getting more people. Again, our city

48:37.986 --> 48:41.650
employees are stretched. I say every day,

48:44.260 --> 48:47.824
they sacrifice what they make, they sacrifice the

48:47.862 --> 48:51.760
hours that they have to be on duty, but they still

48:51.910 --> 48:54.688
provide the level of servants to our residents.

48:54.784 --> 48:58.068
So wish we could have more money, but until then, we're going

48:58.074 --> 49:00.070
to keep providing what we need to provide.

49:00.760 --> 49:03.460
Thank you. Mr Bernard Butler,

49:09.160 --> 49:11.190
last public speaker. Thanks.

49:12.380 --> 49:15.770
He'll ask five questions in a minute, though, right?

49:17.760 --> 49:19.500
Thank you, Madam Director.

49:21.920 --> 49:25.260
Thank you in your department, but apologies, ladies,

49:26.240 --> 49:28.110
I'm going to speak through you.

49:30.260 --> 49:35.232
Let's call a thing a thing. I concluded that all

49:35.286 --> 49:39.024
city departments have been understaffed. It's no

49:39.062 --> 49:42.852
longer about prioritization when

49:42.906 --> 49:47.270
you receive less services. Every citizen should ask when they call.

49:47.880 --> 49:51.940
Thank you. Every citizen should ask when they call a

49:52.090 --> 49:55.576
department, are you fully staffed? Because this is

49:55.598 --> 49:59.464
how communities like mine become underserved for

49:59.502 --> 50:02.996
so long. It's not about great resignations, it's not about tightening

50:03.028 --> 50:06.600
budgets, it's not even about COVID These things just

50:06.670 --> 50:09.832
exposed a situation that existed.

50:09.976 --> 50:13.692
And I will say, at the end of the day, we're citizens too.

50:13.826 --> 50:17.308
But when it comes to where everything

50:17.394 --> 50:20.956
shows up, by the time we get there too

50:20.978 --> 50:24.270
many priorities, but we're already way behind.

50:24.880 --> 50:28.350
Thank you. Thank you.

50:29.200 --> 50:32.780
And directors, thank you very much for your time and your presentation.

50:33.080 --> 50:34.610
Thank you. Thank you.
