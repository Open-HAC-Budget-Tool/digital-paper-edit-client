1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,614
You. So thank you. Thank you. We'll now move into

2
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:07,790
the patient, overly patient It

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,294
department, as we are now

4
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:13,360
officially 55 minutes over.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,462
But I'm sure Director Kent will make up for that 55

6
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:21,920
minutes of lost time.

7
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,680
Am I on?

8
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,350
So, good afternoon. Good afternoon.

9
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,418
As mayor pro Tim Martin indicated, I am Lisa Kent.

10
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:10,294
I am the city's chief information officer and the director

11
00:01:10,422 --> 00:01:13,210
of the Houston It. Services Department.

12
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,654
With me. Here is William Bryant. William was introduced

13
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,434
first by Director Emo. He is the department fiscal

14
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:25,550
Administrator assigned to Hits. He is a member of the finance organization.

15
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,982
Will serves in a CFO like function for my

16
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:33,482
department. And I also want to acknowledge the two financial

17
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:37,134
analysts that support Will. One of them is here today. That's herbert Gardner.

18
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:40,978
He's raising his hand back there. And the other one is Curia askew. She's out

19
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:44,290
of the office today, so she's not present. So together,

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,922
this team of three helps manage a very large

21
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:51,846
and complex budget for the Hits department. And I want

22
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:55,666
to thank them for helping me prepare this presentation and all the data associated

23
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,186
with it. I also want to give a huge shout out to the Hits executive

24
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:02,954
team. They are not here. They are busy working on all the projects that

25
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:07,194
support you and our customers. But I will acknowledge them

26
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:11,226
in the next few slides and give you a little flavor for what they

27
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:14,910
do in our organization. Many of you, in fact,

28
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,126
most of you, have met all of my direct reports and know

29
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:21,450
them from either Cyber or TTI presentations.

30
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,830
And I know you know how proud I am of them, each one of them

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,418
personally, as well as for the professional work that they do for the city of

32
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:32,306
Houston each and every day. So with that, let's get started, and we'll go

33
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:33,410
to the next slide.

34
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,954
So the proposed fiscal year 23 budget for Hits

35
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:43,880
is $98,051,415.

36
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,322
Hits budget is entirely a central services revolving

37
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:51,626
fund, which means that the funding we spend

38
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:55,274
is charged back to those departments who consume our services.

39
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:59,194
And that chargeback shows up in each of those department budgets under

40
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:02,814
their restricted accounts. Our FY 23

41
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:06,350
budget includes the funding for 210.6

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,950
positions. Please note that the FTE funded account

43
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,002
amount for the previous year FY 22 was 202

44
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:18,740
positions, with a vacancy factor of around 7.4%.

45
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,678
This FY 23 increase in the funded FTEs

46
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:27,470
is due to the consolidation of It personnel

47
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,662
from three different departments. So these are not net new

48
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:34,520
positions. They are positions that are moving from one department into the other.

49
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,062
For FY 23, we did choose to increase our vacancy factor

50
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:42,460
to approximately 7.77%.

51
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,014
The decision to do that was made in consideration not only of the economic

52
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:50,454
conditions, but specifically from the

53
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:54,046
significant challenges that we're encountering in the It market and

54
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,194
that is adversely impacting our ability to recruit

55
00:03:57,242 --> 00:04:00,762
It professionals. You may recall Director Emo

56
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:04,270
referenced the great resignation in her initial presentation.

57
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,590
This is certainly something that is impacting it everywhere.

58
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,274
It is not a problem that is unique to the City of Houston. I am

59
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:15,746
a member of the Inspire Houston CIOs group for the

60
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:19,474
city of the Houston regional area. I regularly

61
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:22,966
talk and visit with CIOs from all parts of the

62
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:26,294
business, including private sector, and every single one

63
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,554
of us is facing this challenge. And so this is something that is

64
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:32,780
not unique to City of Houston government.

65
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,046
Looking department wide below that first chart.

66
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:41,370
This body of the slide shows the distribution of funds and personnel across

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,214
seven key areas within our department. You can see the breakdown of

68
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,746
budget and personnel for each of those areas. I'm not going to read this chart,

69
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:51,710
but it's there for your reference. So, next slide.

70
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,406
Now let's go through those key functions. I'm going to do this quickly in

71
00:04:57,428 --> 00:05:00,898
a more abbreviated fashion than I would normally have done. But I do want

72
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:04,514
to start out that at the Director's office level, as the CIO for the City

73
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:08,130
of Houston, I am responsible for It strategic planning

74
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,278
and It governance. In addition to that, we have the amazing

75
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:16,146
Dr. Jane Wu, who is assistant director for our Resource Management

76
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:20,070
division. She's responsible for those additional functions underneath.

77
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,834
Next, the cybersecurity team is led by the city's Chief Information

78
00:05:23,952 --> 00:05:27,542
Security Officer, who is another incredibly talented

79
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:30,714
and powerful leader. That's Dr. Christopher Mitchell. And yes,

80
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:34,478
we do have two PhDs as part of my Direct Reports team.

81
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:38,286
We're very proud of that. Chris is responsible for those

82
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:41,966
things that you see listed below. I do want to emphasize that

83
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:45,794
for FY 23, we will be beginning our efforts to develop the

84
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:49,522
next four year Master plan. And the focus of that going

85
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:52,610
forward will be building an infrastructure with a zero

86
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,986
trust model. And so council member Cayman in

87
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:59,446
advance. I know you're going to be asking the question, what are ways that you

88
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:03,014
guys can support us or unmet needs? We are always going

89
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:06,566
to ask for additional support and additional funding for our

90
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:10,618
cybersecurity program. So you'll hear more from us

91
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,006
in the private briefings that we address with you and where we educate

92
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,180
you a little bit on what we're facing and what we're doing about it.

93
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,130
Transitioning to Enterprise infrastructure services. The Deputy CIO

94
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,250
position for this functional area is currently vacant.

95
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,442
However, we are very blessed to have two strong and capable leaders

96
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:34,314
underneath that vacant position. And so those two groups are

97
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:38,478
the network and telecom services group, led by Assistant Director Anthony Evigan

98
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:41,966
and the Compute services, led by Assistant Director Burke

99
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:45,426
Corford. This is our largest organization, as you can see

100
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:49,762
from the Plier side, both on dollars and on positions.

101
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,286
And so you can take a look later at all the amazing

102
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:55,880
things that they do and to keep the city running.

103
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,670
Next slide.

104
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,162
Next is Public Safety Communications, and this is led by a very

105
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:07,030
strong technical leader, and that is Assistant Director Nick Curran,

106
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,566
one of the things that's not listed in this description. So just a feel for

107
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:14,234
scale. We support over 18,000 radios

108
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:18,206
within the city of Houston. Those are largely police and fire. They're a

109
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:21,914
combination of handheld or portable radios in addition

110
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:24,718
to the in car or mobile radios.

111
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:29,202
Besides those 18,000, we also support 6600

112
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:32,786
radios, for which we sell those services to more

113
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:36,370
than 30 greater Houston regional partners.

114
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,682
And then these last three programming areas are all led by Summer Shao.

115
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:45,526
Summer is one of the real transformational forces on our

116
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,742
Direct Reports team. We couldn't do our job

117
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:52,474
without her and her capable folks. She is responsible for

118
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:55,834
those. Next three. I'm not going to read each one of them, but I will

119
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:59,274
point out that Enterprise Application

120
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:03,546
Services encompasses ERP, which Council Member Kubosh,

121
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:07,434
I know you sometimes ask me about acronyms that is essentially Enterprise

122
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:11,278
Resources Management and Planning is our SAP platform.

123
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:15,060
So that's our financial procurement and HR system.

124
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,574
That group also includes data management, enterprise,

125
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:22,014
GIS, analytics and so forth. And then client management

126
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:25,806
solutions. Those are CSMART. That's the courts

127
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:30,210
where my team maintains the system that Judge Marshall's organization

128
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,226
uses to operate her business. And then finally we have the Hits

129
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:37,774
It Project Management Group, which works on project governance,

130
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:41,590
scope development metrics, and so forth to help us ensure that those projects

131
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,570
meet the expected outcomes. Next slide.

132
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,870
So there aren't any direct statutes that require us to implement

133
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,302
specific electronic systems. However, all of the city

134
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:57,774
departments that you hear from depend on Hits in order to

135
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:01,082
implement their business, and many of them do have statutory

136
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:04,638
requirements to conduct certain services. These three

137
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:08,066
cyber statutes listed below, I'm not going to go through each one of them,

138
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:11,890
but I know that you recognize HIPAA and PCI and security

139
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,390
sensitive information that affects our airport system. Next slide.

140
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,134
In terms of societal impact, again, all city

141
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:25,926
departments depend on us. We have several stats listed there

142
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:29,206
that you can read through that give you a feel for the scale of what

143
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:32,362
we support. At the bottom of the chart, I did list

144
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,322
just a few examples of citizen facing services,

145
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:38,906
and we had planned to share some statistics with you. I can get those to

146
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:42,406
you offline if you're interested. But Council Member

147
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:46,154
Kubosh, one of those was infor, as a matter of fact, for dawn statistics

148
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:49,040
about how much they use that platform for.

149
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,418
Next slide. So let's talk about funding.

150
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:56,898
This is the second fiscal year that Hits is budgeted completely

151
00:09:56,984 --> 00:10:00,366
in the revolving fund. Therefore, all of our expenses

152
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:03,938
are revolved back or charged back to the city department customers.

153
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,506
The chargeback is seen as an expense again in their restricted

154
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:11,282
accounts, but it's offsetting as revenue for my department. And so therefore,

155
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:15,234
this table that you see on this chart represents

156
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:19,126
a revenue table, and it matches the expenditures table that

157
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:22,378
you'll see on the next slide. These amounts will always be the same. We have

158
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:24,860
to zero out our budget at the end of the year.

159
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,370
Thank you. So the revenue highlights.

160
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,434
Again, most of our revenue comes back, but here's a couple of unique revenues

161
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:37,194
that we generate that you might not know about. The first is the Verizon Wireless

162
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:40,750
Rebate in FY 22. Actual revenues already

163
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,278
collected is a million dollars. Of that,

164
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:46,658
794,000 went to the General Government

165
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:50,414
Revenue Fund, 43,000 went to the Houston Airport

166
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:53,842
System and 163,000 went to Houston Public

167
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:57,506
Works. Another cool revenue source is that radio revenue that

168
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:00,582
I talked about. That will be $1.9 million

169
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:04,406
by the time we end this fiscal year. And again, that is

170
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:08,310
booked to the city's general Revenue Fund. Next slide.

171
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,394
So, expenditures. This chart represents a historical view of our

172
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:17,530
expenditures. The variance column over to the right,

173
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,538
second to last, shows you the comparison of FY 23 to FY

174
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:24,654
22 adopted budget. As you can see, that variance is

175
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:28,046
10.8% and I'll go into some details about that on

176
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:29,150
the next slide.

177
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,590
So the overall proposed budget we are submitting again is 98,051,000

178
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,814
in change. Of that only 31% is for personnel.

179
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:45,134
69% of our budget is for services and supplies

180
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:49,470
that provide those products and services to other departments.

181
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,910
The pie chart on the right is that nonpersonal breakdown. That 69%.

182
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,506
And so one thing that's important to note over the past few years we've

183
00:11:57,538 --> 00:12:01,306
made significant progress in benchmarking our expenses to similar

184
00:12:01,408 --> 00:12:04,426
It organizations of like size and function.

185
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:08,234
And so one of the things that you'll notice in this presentation is we are

186
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:12,106
using those same categories that align with the Gartner It budget

187
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:15,898
tool that we use for benchmarking. I'll start with this chart

188
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:19,422
with traditional software and I'll move clockwise around that

189
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:23,518
particular chart. Traditional software makes up 24%

190
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:27,502
of our expenditures and that represents software that is installed physically

191
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:30,754
on our equipment in our data centers. The next one is

192
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,978
SaaS or Software as a service that makes up 16%.

193
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:39,062
And SaaS is an example of a vendor provided and maintained product

194
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:42,840
in the cloud. An example would be Office 365.

195
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,986
The next 15% includes expenses related to education,

196
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:51,210
training and supplies to support our operations.

197
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,554
The next one is transport. Transport portion represents 21%

198
00:12:56,672 --> 00:13:00,326
and that is projected expenses for mobile, fixed data and

199
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:04,782
voice services, citywide pass

200
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,318
or platform as a service along with other public cloud.

201
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:11,834
And Is which is infrastructure as a service. Those represent

202
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:15,502
a combined 2% and they are public cloud management

203
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:18,738
and security services. In simpler terms,

204
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:22,686
those are the things where we use a vendor's infrastructure and that is shared

205
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:26,370
so that we get improved economies of scale and flexibility

206
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,926
for scaling up and scaling down very quickly. Examples of that would

207
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:32,600
be Azure or Amazon Web Services.

208
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,490
Next. The 17% is allocated to traditional outsourcing

209
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,286
and they are the fees that we pay for consultants and managed

210
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:45,034
services where we may hire a company to do a service for us

211
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:48,534
like communications, cabling or portions

212
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:52,714
of our telecom infrastructure. And then the final category is 5% for

213
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:55,598
hardware. One important point to note on that,

214
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:59,098
we do buy a lot of hardware through our capital improvement budget. So it's

215
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:02,838
not surprising that hardware is a lower percentage in the operating budget.

216
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:03,970
Next slide.

217
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,906
Now I would like to highlight some of the net changes in

218
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:13,442
the proposed FY 23 budget over FY 22.

219
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:17,522
The first item you will see again that we are consolidating

220
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:21,302
resources. Five of those FTEs are

221
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:25,474
coming from the Houston Health Department in the infrastructure

222
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:29,014
area. Three are from Houston Public Works. That is

223
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:32,150
part of our consolidation of cybersecurity for that department.

224
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,482
Those are moving under dr. Chris Mitchell. And then the last

225
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:39,114
one is in Legal, a partial consolidation. And those

226
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:42,798
folks that one individual physician is moving under our infrastructure team.

227
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:46,270
So together these combined are 1.34 million.

228
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,710
Again moving into my department from another department.

229
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,698
Secondly, you can see the hope increases for approximately 846,000

230
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:58,994
increase over last year's budget. Next you'll see

231
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,626
two net new initiatives. Those expenditure lines have been

232
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:05,958
submitted for approval to the administration. These dollars

233
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:09,830
support the maintenance of our open data portal and also

234
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,510
new radio security services which is going to help us

235
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,362
protect our radio system from malicious

236
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:20,010
software and other malicious activity.

237
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,502
And finally, the restricted accounts for Hits consist of allocations

238
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:27,782
Hits receives from other departments such as Ara,

239
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:31,326
Human Resources, Finance and Planning. So in summary, we have

240
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,922
a 10.8% increase. I will highlight

241
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:38,510
the key portions of that increase on the upcoming slide.

242
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,686
So I won't go over it consolidation again, but I

243
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,774
will move down to some of what you'll see in our budget is a realignment

244
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,246
of expenses. So for example, Director Emo referenced

245
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,882
Hits is the pilot department. We are always

246
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:58,322
up for a challenge and being the guinea pig for the city to try things

247
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:02,166
first. And so as part of that initiative, we went through and looked at one

248
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:05,974
of the areas we needed to separate from one cost center into

249
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:09,206
two was our end user Compute support services. So that's just

250
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:13,146
dividing those into two cost centers and that will also help

251
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:17,254
us with cleaner chargeback. Another example of Realignment

252
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:20,530
is in the data management area. This is another one council member Kubosh

253
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,722
asked me about. We hired the Edo,

254
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:27,402
which is the Enterprise data Officer his name is Raphael Luvre.

255
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:29,870
And when we did that hire,

256
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,142
we did realign the expenses of the resources that now

257
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:37,774
can report up under that separate cost center for those functions.

258
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:41,390
I also want to point out that the hiring of the Edo

259
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,102
helped us as a city accomplish one of the actions

260
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:49,560
required by the Resilient Houston plan. That's action number 44.1.

261
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,330
And then finally on Realignments we are also adjusting

262
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,954
costs between Esignature and managed print services.

263
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:02,970
So in further support of Resilient Houston and the climate action plan.

264
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,314
We are driving print costs down and we are

265
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:09,414
encouraging an increased usage of Esignature.

266
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:13,630
So more electronic processing, less printing

267
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,550
transitioning. Let's talk about Microsoft.

268
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,406
Last August, Microsoft announced that they would

269
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:27,266
be rolling out a substantive price increase across the

270
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:30,126
board to all Office 365 subscribers.

271
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:33,426
That's global. Okay? We were grandfathered in. That's why it

272
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:37,254
did not affect my budget in FY 22. We were still under the

273
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:40,386
current Enterprise agreement where the pricing was locked.

274
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:44,374
However, next month I will be coming to the TTI committee to

275
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:48,326
present to you the proposed new three year enterprise agreement for

276
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:52,070
the city and that will incorporate the price increase

277
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,846
as well as an upgrade in features that we will be requesting. So you'll

278
00:17:55,878 --> 00:17:59,574
hear a lot more from me about what's involved in those prices.

279
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:03,594
But just a little preview, that's part of what is

280
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:06,734
included in our FY 23 budget. And then

281
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:10,618
next, we've already discussed a little bit about the job market and the great resignation.

282
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:14,618
One of the things that we had to include in our budget for FY 23,

283
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:18,402
we noticed the most significant attrition in our ERP group.

284
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:21,874
Again, that's our SAP support function. And so

285
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:25,374
we did submit as part of our budget to augment that ERP

286
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:28,486
team. That addresses the concern that we're having not

287
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:31,714
only with retirement and attrition, but the difficulty

288
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:35,618
in the extended periods of time it's taking us to recruit, to backfill.

289
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:39,530
And then finally in the cybersecurity insurance sector,

290
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,574
this continues to diminish as more providers

291
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,934
vacate that space. That results in an increase

292
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:50,406
in premiums and it also results

293
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:54,286
in a reduction of coverage. And so that's something that you will

294
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:58,014
hear more from us about in some of the private briefings. And so there

295
00:18:58,052 --> 00:19:01,674
you have it. That is a summary of the FY 23 expenditure

296
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:05,690
changes. This concludes my presentation.

297
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,058
I do want to invite you to browse through the appendix. There are

298
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,798
a lot of documents back there that talk about not only our organization,

299
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:17,514
but also our strategic priorities, challenges with technological

300
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:21,206
debt, and our FY 22 accomplishments. So with

301
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:24,578
that, I'll be glad to take your questions. Thank you, Director Kent.

302
00:19:24,674 --> 00:19:28,406
Council Member Michael Kubosh. Thank you very much, Director Kent.

303
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:31,770
I appreciate your biweekly report for the Open

304
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,154
Finance. The cybersecurity that you

305
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:39,846
have us take online is extremely helpful

306
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,146
to people like me that I wasn't

307
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:46,686
born with a mouse in my hand. So I've learned a

308
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:50,110
lot from those cyber security courses.

309
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,630
I appreciate you giving us advanced notice on rates

310
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,578
and rate increases and things that we have to purchase because it used to just

311
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:02,434
give this council shell shock when we'd see these things

312
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:06,114
appear. Do we get federal grants to help

313
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:09,830
us to pay for cybersecurity? Is there anything available

314
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,022
that may help us to mitigate the cost of some of these things?

315
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:17,138
Yes, sir. We do get federal grant money through UASI,

316
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:21,366
and that is granted through the City's Department

317
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:24,250
of homeland Security under Chief Eunuch.

318
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,740
What we get from them is largely training.

319
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,814
We do seek to get more money, and we have been lobbying

320
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:35,490
federal legislatures,

321
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,034
legislators, to help us have the federal

322
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:42,990
government release more cybersecurity money to actually buy product

323
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,510
and services. Now, I do expect to see that

324
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,986
in some of the new federal bills. We have not yet seen it

325
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:54,382
trickle down, but you might see that in the infrastructure bill once it's finally announced.

326
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:58,950
I would like to see updated times where you give us this mandatory

327
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,706
cybersecurity training because I think it's

328
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:06,278
really needed and I really do appreciate it. Thank you.

329
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:09,766
Thank you, council Member Abby Cayman. Thank you,

330
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:13,034
Mayor. Pro TEM director. I think you know where my

331
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:16,970
questions are going to be, are going to go towards but I think it's

332
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,494
startling. A lot of the budget presentations we see personnel

333
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:24,958
is the major cost. You don't see that with it.

334
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:29,066
I think that's two things, but correct me if I'm wrong. One, we don't

335
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:32,302
have a lot of personnel in the department. I work with Dr.

336
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:36,210
Mitchell and you a lot. I don't know how he does everything that he does.

337
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,442
He is incredible. But it's also the cost

338
00:21:39,496 --> 00:21:42,930
of this type of equipment, the technological cost,

339
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,514
that, again, a lot of it's behind the scenes, but it's

340
00:21:46,642 --> 00:21:49,510
necessary to keep the city safe.

341
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,326
I know that we cannot in a public realm discuss a lot as

342
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:57,982
it relates to Homeland Security concerns,

343
00:21:58,146 --> 00:22:02,060
cyber concerns, but we have seen some of the more public

344
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,220
hacks and things like that that have occurred. For example, Kronos was

345
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,062
something that actually didn't impact us as much as it did other

346
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:16,270
businesses, but still had an impact that wasn't against city infrastructure.

347
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,894
But given the current

348
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:24,340
dynamics, the war in Ukraine, other issues,

349
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,282
where are we as a city, just generally speaking, in terms

350
00:22:29,336 --> 00:22:33,374
of coming into moving beyond the last century,

351
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,780
in terms of technology upgrades here?

352
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,286
Thank you for asking that question. I will give you a

353
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:44,998
measured response. We can provide

354
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:49,082
and do provide a lot of detailed information to you,

355
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:52,166
city council members, and obviously to Mayor Turner

356
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:55,914
that are very specific about what the city

357
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:58,490
faces from a cybersecurity perspective.

358
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,480
What I will say publicly is that

359
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,242
with your support, we have been making tremendous

360
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:13,070
strides. One of the things that you will see spoken

361
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,642
about publicly with anyone talking

362
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,982
about cybersecurity is the need for a layered

363
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:23,938
defense strategy. And so no matter

364
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:27,602
which entity you talk to, government or private sector alike,

365
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:31,494
they will all tell you we're always going to need to do

366
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:35,302
more. Okay? And so what we need

367
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:39,166
you to understand is much to Council Member Kubosh's

368
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:42,874
comment, that it takes everybody, it takes the employees to

369
00:23:42,912 --> 00:23:46,202
be security conscious, and it takes us to put

370
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:50,118
many layers of defense in there simply to have a fighting

371
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:53,486
chance at slowing down the adversary. I could be put back

372
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:55,920
in queue. Go ahead,

373
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,734
last one. You're the only one. All right, I'll hurry up because I know people

374
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,514
want a quick break for lunch, if we can. Not yet,

375
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:07,650
no, keep driving.

376
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,234
I was just at a roundtable conversation this morning

377
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:16,866
with FEMA. So we're talking about the federal dollars that

378
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,230
we need to draw down upon. And we were talking with different

379
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,814
colleagues around the country about what keeps us up at night,

380
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:27,446
and cybersecurity redundancy is what keeps me up

381
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:29,080
at night. But also,

382
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,322
Council Member Peck and I talk a lot about this other council members,

383
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:36,922
our CAD system, other needs that are just

384
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,346
so high in terms of price tag that we as

385
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:43,642
a city cannot afford without those investments. We have CAD.

386
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:47,006
That is a need. Are there other needs that we should be aware of right

387
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:52,320
now as it relates to those It

388
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,766
assets that we can speak about publicly?

389
00:24:56,878 --> 00:25:00,546
Yes. If you would flip to page 20,

390
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:04,386
which is in the appendix section. There's a chart there that gives you a

391
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:07,878
feel for the scale. When we talk about

392
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,542
technical debt or technological debt, we're talking

393
00:25:11,596 --> 00:25:14,742
about systems that no different than

394
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:18,922
what Director Haddock spoke about with her infrastructure for

395
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:23,174
water and sewer. The city has infrastructure,

396
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:27,110
both hardware and software applications that we have to maintain.

397
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,454
And when you don't replace those often enough,

398
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:34,714
you create a vulnerability, which translates

399
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:38,094
to risk. Those equipments either get old and

400
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:42,654
they don't function as well as they used to, or they are

401
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:46,670
no longer supported by the manufacturer. And therefore, that translates into a cyber risk.

402
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,386
So this chart, that's worth looking at. If you look on the right hand side

403
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:54,926
of the page, it shows you what our five year citywide

404
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,466
CIP is. The only thing not included in that is the Houston

405
00:25:58,498 --> 00:26:01,670
Airport systems. Separate CIP and Houston Public Works.

406
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,480
Separate CIP. But otherwise, that number of 39,000,500

407
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,354
is the five year number for years 22

408
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:12,140
through 26 for capital investment in technology.

409
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,794
The left hand side of the column is only the top six

410
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:19,580
projects that we need funding for.

411
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,594
Really? Four and a half of those six are public safety

412
00:26:23,642 --> 00:26:27,280
technology related. So in terms of what is needed,

413
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,546
the city needs more spending capacity

414
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,622
to deal with public safety technology equipment.

415
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:38,450
And the ones that I've listed there are HPD Radio refresh,

416
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,846
the HPD Records Management System network refresh,

417
00:26:42,878 --> 00:26:46,026
which I'm saying is partially public safety related CAD,

418
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:49,590
which you just asked about $17 million. The only

419
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,698
one that is wholly not public safety related is the SAPS

420
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:56,998
for Hana upgrade. But at the

421
00:26:57,004 --> 00:27:00,746
top, there is CSMART, where we need to do some continued technology

422
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:04,714
refresh. And that does have some public safety implications with that

423
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:08,140
system as well. So these monies, you can tell

424
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,058
the dramatic skewing of what's available

425
00:27:12,224 --> 00:27:15,440
versus what is needed just for the top six.

426
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,326
No, and I appreciate that highlight. And just for those in

427
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:22,938
the public that are listening, when we talk about records Management systems

428
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:26,306
with HPD. That sounds very basic, but there's certain data that

429
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:30,034
we cannot even track right now, including when a

430
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:33,710
crime involves a gun, whether that gun was stolen,

431
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,090
whether it was obtained legally. We cannot track

432
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,074
any of that right now, even though we're dealing with astronomical

433
00:27:41,122 --> 00:27:44,246
levels of gun violence. So all these basic things, right, that we think as

434
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:48,054
a city we should be able to do, we are having challenges with.

435
00:27:48,092 --> 00:27:50,862
So I just appreciate your department.

436
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:54,298
Again, so much of it goes back to Public Safety. I don't

437
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:57,402
know how you do and your team do all the things that you do do,

438
00:27:57,456 --> 00:28:00,902
but recognizing the budgetary

439
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:05,180
limitations that we are continuing to face right now. Thank you.

440
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,450
So, Director Cant, one thing struck me and one thing only in your budget.

441
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,090
So 22 to 23, you have an

442
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,626
interdepartmental credit

443
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,210
for 1.3 million. Without that, you're 34 million

444
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,420
less than what you spent last year.

445
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,558
Right. So you had 88 you -1.3 you're

446
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:30,930
at 98. Because you had interdepartmental

447
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,502
consolidations of FTE. Can you put some color around that?

448
00:28:34,556 --> 00:28:37,906
Because I look at it and I go at 1.34 million.

449
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:41,882
That's 18 employees at $75,000.

450
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:46,038
So I'm assuming we're going to see the appropriate

451
00:28:46,214 --> 00:28:49,626
debit from Public Works, which we

452
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:52,350
didn't see because I just looked through their notes.

453
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,870
Legal and HHD,

454
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,294
you're getting the people, but the flow of funds isn't following you.

455
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:05,386
It is following you. But the appropriate debit isn't coming out of their department's

456
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:08,846
expense. That's right. Because they continue to pay for those resources

457
00:29:08,878 --> 00:29:11,966
that are dedicated to them. So what is a little bit confusing

458
00:29:11,998 --> 00:29:16,190
about we added 1.3 to your budget on the increase.

459
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,986
Yes. What is confusing about the way the revolving funds

460
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:23,042
work is the money has to be on both sides of the fence.

461
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:28,130
So for me to have the control of those positions

462
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:32,374
and the money to fund them, it has to show up in my revolving

463
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:35,898
fund budget. It also has to show up on their side of the

464
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:39,900
house in their restricted account. And so when I charge them back,

465
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,834
it goes back. So I'm looking for I see your credit

466
00:29:43,952 --> 00:29:47,706
of 1.3. I don't see their debit of 1.3 or whatever theirs

467
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:50,926
is for their individual department, but their debit will be in

468
00:29:50,948 --> 00:29:54,206
their restricted account. In the restricted account. So all of

469
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:57,310
our expenses are budget within the department's restricted accounts.

470
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:01,426
So that slide where like on our slide number

471
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:05,102
15, where you have a list of all the inner fund restrictive accounts,

472
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:09,218
we would charge them back. Okay. Why are you assuming I'm

473
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:12,834
going to say 75,000. That's 18 people. Why are you assuming

474
00:30:12,882 --> 00:30:16,680
18 people into your department? What's going on?

475
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,362
We're not assuming 18 individuals who we're absorbing nine,

476
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,246
plus their hope increases. Okay, so you're absorbing

477
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:27,546
their salary? Yes, only their salary, but not their

478
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:31,690
reporting accountability. We're absorbing their reporting

479
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,142
reporting structure as well. So who do they report to? Do they report

480
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:39,566
to hits. Yes. In fact, that's one of the reasons why we

481
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,954
do that, because if we leave the money exclusively in their budget,

482
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:46,514
where they have the ability to choose to spend it on something else,

483
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:49,826
I love the fact that your department is

484
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,870
more of a centralized function. I hate decentralized function organizations.

485
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,314
That's a massive screw up. You're just waiting for some bad

486
00:30:57,352 --> 00:31:00,294
things to happen. So I'm a big fan of what you did. Okay, great.

487
00:31:00,332 --> 00:31:03,782
Because I believe they should be reporting to you even though they're housed in another

488
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:07,090
department. But I just wanted to see where they corresponded.

489
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,466
Like Mayor Turner says, hey, you can raise the budget,

490
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:14,060
but tell me where you're going to get the money. Well, you raised your money

491
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,426
by 1.3 million, and you didn't tell me where

492
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:22,234
it came from, because I looked back on one of the departments that already presented.

493
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:25,790
The other two are later, and they didn't have the corresponding debit.

494
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,960
It's restricted. So we'll ask Legal and we'll ask

495
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,342
Houston Health when they come. So. Thank you, council Member Sally Alcorn.

496
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:39,154
Are there some other departments that you think would benefit from being

497
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:42,660
consolidated in, or have you swept everybody in that you need to?

498
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,840
We definitely have that's a loaded question.

499
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,574
There are definitely opportunities, and some of those opportunities are

500
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:55,654
already in discussion with those directors. I wouldn't want to say

501
00:31:55,692 --> 00:31:59,618
that publicly, but there are definitely opportunities for

502
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:03,306
that. Yes. Great. Thanks. You all

503
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,586
do a great job. Thank you. Day in and day out. I appreciate what you

504
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:10,942
do. I'm sorry. We have four public

505
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,790
speakers. We'll start out with Mr. Doug Smith,

506
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,830
star six. Doug,

507
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,240
can you hear me? Yes, sir.

508
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,070
Yes. Okay, good. To follow up on the last comment,

509
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,546
relative to are you going to when you look through

510
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:35,250
the budget, you see lots of departments that have what I would call hit

511
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,886
related expenses, and I guess you're in the process of trying to

512
00:32:38,988 --> 00:32:43,094
sweep all of those in as much as possible. One that

513
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:46,678
just came from this morning is Houston Public Works. They show $20 million

514
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,650
for computer related expenses. So I'm glad to hear you're in the process

515
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,460
of trying to rope everybody in. And one final question.

516
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,780
Why did the salary for HFD support account

517
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,470
50 00:10 increased by 50%?

518
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,022
And also regarding that, do you provide any kind of similar support

519
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:10,702
to the Houston Police Department? Okay.

520
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:14,846
Mr. Smith, the reason why you see the increase in the HFD personnel once we've

521
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:18,654
gone through the exercise of looking at the EIS

522
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:22,462
compute call center, basically, we took those individuals that were dedicated

523
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:26,034
to HFD and moved those to the HFD call center.

524
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:29,430
So that's why you see that increase in personnel. So the support

525
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,806
level has not changed, but we did move the position,

526
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:35,830
so therefore the dollars will be in the correct funding structure.

527
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,858
Okay. Do you do similar support for Houston Police Department as well?

528
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:42,300
No, we. Do not.

529
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,578
The Houston Police Department is what we consider to

530
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:51,310
be a Federated It organization, which means they have

531
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,626
a Chief Technology Officer and a sizable It organization.

532
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:59,850
So what my department provides to HPD are the Enterprise

533
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,766
services, which is a whole lot of things,

534
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:06,626
but there are many services that they still do themselves out

535
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:10,174
of that technology budget. So they will have both a restricted

536
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:13,618
account chargeback from my department as well as

537
00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:17,078
a separate It budget for their own. Thank you.

538
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:21,270
Mr. Why do they have a mr. Oliver. Jason Oliver.

539
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:28,620
Thanks for interrupting. Thank you.

540
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,210
Hi. Thank you all for the presentation.

541
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:38,362
The budget was amended last year, item 6.34,

542
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:41,534
to include an online portal for people to sign up

543
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:45,054
for public session. I wanted to check in on if that has

544
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:48,506
been implemented or if we can get a target completion

545
00:34:48,538 --> 00:34:49,120
date.

546
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,152
We were just conferring, Mr. Oliver. I'm not sure that that

547
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:04,104
particular amendment was actually approved, but what I can tell

548
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:07,512
you, we do have a project underway that is currently in the

549
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:11,870
planning phase. It won't be implemented until later in FY 23,

550
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,360
but that is to upgrade the system that the city council uses

551
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,756
for City council agenda. And so our thought is

552
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:23,132
that we would be using that same platform to allow the digital sign

553
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:26,736
up of speakers. Now, one thing in addition to that that we

554
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:30,416
have also been doing is to utilize tool sets that

555
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:34,348
we already have to encourage the city secretary's office to leverage

556
00:35:34,444 --> 00:35:38,004
things like teams and SharePoint that as people sign up.

557
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:41,488
That can be done on those existing tools, but we do have plans

558
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:45,172
to enhance it for the future. Okay, and then can you share

559
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,644
more about what on page eleven, the open

560
00:35:48,682 --> 00:35:51,896
data portal support means, and then how often we can expect to

561
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:55,368
see updates in the future? I also want to say thank you all.

562
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:59,176
After last year, you all updated and

563
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,900
made the open data portal accessible again, which was really appreciated.

564
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,156
So thank you for that. We're just checking in about what that means. So you

565
00:36:06,178 --> 00:36:10,220
just answered my question, your own question. So we were having a lot of problems

566
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:14,160
with that open data portal where, if you may recall, it would go offline.

567
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,024
That is a legacy application that we needed some additional support.

568
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:22,912
And so the money that we built in as an ad to our budget was

569
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:26,784
to outsource that additional support until we could simply redesign

570
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:30,788
it. So the redesign of that open data portal is planned for FY 23 as

571
00:36:30,794 --> 00:36:35,008
well. Thank you. Doing that support I'm

572
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:38,436
sorry, who's offering that support? How is

573
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:41,928
that working? I don't recall the name of the vendor off the

574
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:45,176
top of my head. I can get back to you offline about that, but it

575
00:36:45,198 --> 00:36:48,264
is a vendor consultant that is assisting us with that. Got you.

576
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:52,204
Thank you, Ms. Planning. As Ms. Planning walks up, so are we moving away

577
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:55,804
from Novus there is a

578
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:59,596
project to upgrade Novus. So what the solution will

579
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:02,832
be is yet to be determined whether it continues to be

580
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:06,464
the evolution of Novus or another product. Thank you.

581
00:37:06,662 --> 00:37:10,604
Hey, thank you for your presentation. Lots of helpful

582
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:14,832
explanations in there. I have two questions for you. I noticed almost

583
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:18,644
60% of the top technological needs you

584
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:22,768
listed, I believe it was in the appendix, belong to HPD improvements.

585
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:26,780
And I was curious as to how these priorities were made, especially after you explained

586
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,010
that HPD kind of has their own It.

587
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,000
And then what are other priorities that aren't listed that you would consider

588
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,964
a high priority? And then the second question is management

589
00:37:39,012 --> 00:37:42,104
consulting services has increased dramatically from last fiscal

590
00:37:42,152 --> 00:37:45,548
year, now 3 million from about 1 million. And what is the

591
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:49,164
reason for that jump? Okay, so Will

592
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:51,984
is going to help keep me straight on the questions in order, but let's talk

593
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,296
first about this chart, the technological debt. Okay,

594
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:59,280
so HPD participates along with

595
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,944
all the other city departments, excluding airports and

596
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:06,608
public works in the citywide, technology, CIP.

597
00:38:06,704 --> 00:38:10,404
So these are all investments that would be capital projects and

598
00:38:10,442 --> 00:38:14,336
they are a part of that solution pool or the group that considers

599
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:17,844
those. The considerations for why are

600
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:21,576
these systems on the list and why are they priority one, safe Houston and

601
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:24,772
public safety is clearly Mayor Turner's top priority.

602
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:28,744
And one of the things that we look at when we evaluate the

603
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:32,856
prioritization of It spend is where there is risk.

604
00:38:32,968 --> 00:38:37,212
And in these cases, these equipment, these systems are all end of life

605
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:40,780
and they pose risk to the city and the police department.

606
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,320
Thank you, Mr. Butler.

607
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,170
I don't know how to get back to her.

608
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,090
Okay.

609
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,908
Hi, good afternoon. I think you guys do an excellent job. I've just got

610
00:38:57,914 --> 00:39:01,380
a series of questions I'll use in my three minutes and then you can respond.

611
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,064
Can you rank your top three priorities?

612
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:10,184
And you did to finish up that conversation you just started that give

613
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,896
you the best return on investment, dollar wise for every dollar you

614
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:18,728
spend? The next question is basically,

615
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:22,296
how are you guys going to do more with less? Because that's the way you've

616
00:39:22,328 --> 00:39:25,628
painted this picture. It's impressive. I just want to know how you're going to do

617
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:29,464
the magic trick. The other question is, has the city's

618
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:32,956
IDT department been affected by the pandemic and the supply

619
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:37,308
chain in slowing down or hindering either major upgrades

620
00:39:37,404 --> 00:39:40,768
or rollouts or updates that you have?

621
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:44,436
Also, you said you do travel and connect with other cities. Does the

622
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:47,940
city of Houston rank statewide, regionally and nationally

623
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,196
well and does your budget reflect managing city the

624
00:39:52,218 --> 00:39:55,444
size of Houston? And lastly, very broad question,

625
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:59,130
how has it priority shifted for you and why?

626
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,416
May I start to answer those? I don't think I can get to all of

627
00:40:05,438 --> 00:40:10,016
them. Okay, so can you give us Readers

628
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:13,740
Digest version? Okay, so question

629
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,964
number one top three priorities based on ROI. We definitely

630
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,964
focus on things that pose risk, because if we don't deal with those,

631
00:40:22,082 --> 00:40:25,520
they present themselves as much larger, much more expensive problems

632
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,264
to fix after the fact. Okay, so cyber is a great example, but so is

633
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,976
aging equipment. The next one, how are we going to do more

634
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:36,500
than with less? That is a big challenge.

635
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,840
Thankfully, we hire people who like challenges.

636
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,316
But in terms of getting the best bang for

637
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:47,204
the buck, we look to identify solutions and

638
00:40:47,242 --> 00:40:50,696
platforms that solve multiple problems. And so you will see

639
00:40:50,718 --> 00:40:54,424
us identifying, particularly in the areas of applications that can

640
00:40:54,462 --> 00:40:57,764
meet multiple departments needs. We talked about infor earlier.

641
00:40:57,812 --> 00:41:01,370
We have several departments using that permitting and inspection platform.

642
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,212
Supply chain? Yes. It's a huge problem. There are certain

643
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:08,924
pieces of equipment. I won't name the manufacturer, but we have

644
00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:11,964
been waiting for things that normally we would get in one to two months is

645
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,690
taking more than a year. It's a huge problem.

646
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,164
Priority shift. How have my priorities

647
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:22,304
shifted since the Pandemic? We have

648
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:26,480
definitely been pushing city departments to accelerate

649
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,364
their digital transformation. One of the things I'm very proud of from

650
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:34,452
the city's infrastructure standpoint, and even

651
00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:37,856
our applications portfolio, many of those tools

652
00:41:37,888 --> 00:41:41,376
were already there. What we needed to do is help departments

653
00:41:41,408 --> 00:41:46,240
with the business transformation to be able to really embrace operating

654
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,900
digitally all the way to the end. Customer out in the field.

655
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,944
Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. And that concludes

656
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:57,596
this part. And, Director Ken, as your neighbor of mine, my son came over

657
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:00,830
and messed up my printer. So can you come over later on?

658
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,150
I'll see what I can do.
